<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cornelius's motivation is clear, rooted in loss and synesthetic perception, and intensifies believably. His final choice to sing Isabella's song is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is strong ("touch a symphony of purple light and cinnamon warmth"), and the Earned Stasis of their eternal performance carries a felt cost of their ghostly state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved on-page with the ghosts' eternal encore, its cost felt in their spectral permanence. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory and temporal density. The coin's mechanics are the one minor ambiguity, but its function is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard is indispensable, constraining choice by its fractured nature and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Cornelius's synesthesia ("tasted of cardamom and looked like spiraling gold"). The setting evolves causally with the temporal braiding, fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cornelius's agency under the Accumulative lens, using echoes to pull possibilities closer. The dominant stake (reuniting with Isabella) is signaled early and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift when he chooses to sing. The cost of foreclosing a mortal life is legible in their ghostly encore.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (love transcending time) emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The final image of the transformed coin offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as the intertwined figures on the coin representing their reconfigured existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia. The poetic, elevated diction is voice-motivated and consistent, even under pressure. The patterned elision of the coin's exact rules is taught and paid off at closure without harming legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional complex sentences that slightly slow momentum (e.g., "His synesthetic blessing had followed him into death..."). However, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscure the crucial closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of ghost story, time fracture, and synesthesia feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lush, accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
