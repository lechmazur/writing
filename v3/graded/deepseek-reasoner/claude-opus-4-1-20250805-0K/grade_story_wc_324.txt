<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her professional curiosity and empathy, compelling her to pursue higher stakes. Her embodied emotion ("taste copper on her tongue") and micro-choices under pressure feel authentic. However, the final heroic stance ("refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear") is slightly more told than shown in the closing lines, leaning on summary rather than a final, dramatized choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (locating the stolen voices) with a resonant reconfiguration (the mist lifting, hearts remembering to speak) that carries clear conceptual cost. The causal lens holds tightly from the initial pulse to the final revelation. The fading photograph provides a powerful, on-page cost proof that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a masterclass in economical, purposeful setting. It actively pressures the protagonist ("taste copper on the tongue") and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Mara's professional POV, with the environment ("cathedral of suspended gold") subtly mirroring her internal quest for something precious and lost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, moving from listening to understanding to acting. The dominant stake (saving the residents) is signaled early and tightens effectively with the photograph's transformation, a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and raises the cost. The final run toward the basement is a clear, agentive choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (protecting vulnerable voices from being erased) emerges organically from the core concept and is deeply integrated into the plot and character. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of returning voices and lifting mist, reweighting the opening without moralizing. The concept of "emotional contagion" is a fresh, specific inflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, professional voice. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, especially in peak beats ("like a heart trying to remember its rhythm"). A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the final paragraph's more summary-like language compared to the dense, embodied prose of the opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent information density and sensory specificity. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating with the discovery of the fading photo. A minor -0.4 deduction for a template-cadence run in the final paragraph ("She hadn't meant... had only been... But sometimes..."), which slightly dulls the closure's impact compared to the sharper imagery preceding it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of an "emotional contact tracer" is highly original and ingeniously executed. The combination of the magical hearing aid, the contagion of silence, and memory theft feels organic and fresh, not a checklist. The story commits fully to its singular vision, synthesizing familiar genres (noir, supernatural) into a memorable and specific whole.</comment>
