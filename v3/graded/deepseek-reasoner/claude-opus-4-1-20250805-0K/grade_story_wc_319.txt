<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional embodiment of feral transformation and homesickness through concrete, contradictory impulses. The final choice to trust the scholar is earned by prior causality of her isolation and the pendant's weight. Minor deduction for slight telling in the climax ("felt her feral nature softening") rather than pure embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds: the scholar's arrival directly triggers the guardian's choice to use the Codex, culminating in a decisive change (going home) with felt cost (leaving her post, trusting uncertainty). Orientation is immediate; closure lands on-page with the thawing garden and internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The frozen garden is indispensable, constraining movement and mirroring internal state. The pendant and Codex function as micro-settings, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like "dead grass that crunched like broken glass."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the scholar's request, forcing the guardian's high-stakes choice to abandon her duty. The dominant stake (rescue vs. duty) tightens credibly, with cost legible in the guardian's tears and the garden's thaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty and homesickness emerges organically through the pendant's cold weight and the guardian's embodied struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the act of stepping into "luminous uncertainty."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent POV with a feral, perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm reflect her degraded speech and heightened senses ("pupils gone vertical"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and naturalistic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, purposeful imagery. Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating at closure. One minor loop: "uncertainty" appears twice in quick succession at the end, but does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library horror and dimensional travel, transformed through specific character choices (feral guardian, cultist's pendant). The core premise is fully committed to, with originality rooted in emotional truth rather than surface novelty.</comment>
