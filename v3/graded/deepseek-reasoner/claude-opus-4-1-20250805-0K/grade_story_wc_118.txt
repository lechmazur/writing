<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thrain's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "sensitively perceptive" trait driving every action. Her final realization—that she must "tend the echo"—is an Earned Stasis foreclosing other paths with visible cost, rooted in prior micro-choices like probing the diaries. Contradictory impulses (wonder and duty) act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the "bronze quiet" is reweighted from an ending to a "pause" where "all possibilities existed simultaneously." The Accumulative lens holds, with pressure building through layered discoveries (tapestry, diaries, drawing) until her consciousness "slides" along the axis. Cost is legible in her acceptance of solitude to "remember stories into being."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The silo library is indispensable, constraining choice (spiral stairs limit movement) and charging the final image (walls "dense with listening"). Sensory detail is purposefully selective—"spines that remembered being trees," "cold air that tasted of old paper"—filtered through Thrain's professional sensitivity. The micro-setting (fireplace, diaries) actively enables her discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Thrain's agency: each probe (tapestry, diaries, drawing) deepens her knowledge until the axis displacement becomes personally felt. The dominant stake (preserving memory) tightens as she realizes her purpose is not passive collection but active stewardship against cyclical oblivion. Cost is the weight of solitary endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tapestry's recontextualization—myth as documented reality—and the silo's layered history. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: memory is not storage but active recursion, "patient as stone." Subtext operates in images like "half-burned diaries like broken birds," tying decay to revelation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internalized, with syntax mirroring Thrain's perceptive rhythm ("her fingers probing the scorched edges"). Lyric compression ("bronze-quiet") is taught early and pays off at closure. No dialogue, but internal voice is distinct and consistent, with perceptual bias favoring tactile and historical impressions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("the world had gone bronze-quiet since the last human dream flickered out"). Minor figurative strain in "diaries lay scattered like broken birds" slightly muddles tone, but overall rhythm supports accumulation. No loops or scaffolding; closure image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic archivy, medieval cosmology, and existential physics feels fresh and inevitable. The "displaced axis" concept is transformed through specific tactile details (woven dragons, diary impressions) rather than abstraction. Risk-taking in lyric compression and non-causal escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
