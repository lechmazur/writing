<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner's characterization is deeply embodied through concrete actions ("fingers tracing constellations in the mud") and a clear, consistent motivation rooted in her solitary communion with the place. Her patient, shepherd-like endurance under pressure feels earned, and her final choice to disperse the prophecy carries a visible, felt cost in the story's final image of solitude and peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through the density of sensory detail and the prophecy's escalating struggle against her silencing. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with a clear cost: the world's "peculiar kind of peace" is bought with her solitude and the knowledge of what she has prevented. The lens holds perfectly from the first paragraph to the last.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are not just described but function as an active, constraining element of the plot. The setting supplies the essential resource (the brook's murmur) and becomes the final vessel for the prophecy, directly shaping the protagonist's tactics and charging the closure. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through her professional, intimate knowledge of the place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the prophecy's struggle against the summoner's silencing, a coherent pressure that deepens under the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake (preventing the prophecy's fulfillment) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as she must gather more allies and work through the night. The cost of her success—the solitude and the weight of her knowledge—is legible and palpable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of truths being "kindest when allowed to remain whispers" emerges organically from the specific, dramatized action of dispersing the prophecy. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether some futures are better left unrealized, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture and a controlled perceptual signature firmly anchored in the summoner's POV. The voice is consistent and effectively modulates between the concrete ("crystallized moonlight") and the conceptual ("living things that grew louder with each telling"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of rhythmic similarity in the prophecy fragments ("—the mountain's teeth shall gnaw the—" and "—seven mothers weeping gold—"), but this is a purposeful pattern that does not obscure clarity or dull the closure. Prose is otherwise flawless and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar fantasy tropes (prophecy, summoner) into a profoundly original and specific concept—silencing a prophecy by dispersing it into nature. The core premise is committed to fully and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The choice of an accumulative, textural drive over a causal one is a bold risk that heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
