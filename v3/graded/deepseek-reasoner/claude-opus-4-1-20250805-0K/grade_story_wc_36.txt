<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kessa's motivation is clear and rooted in failure, compelling her high-stakes choice to play a new song. Her internal conflict is embodied in trembling fingers and a drive for understanding, not redemption. The final choice to accept the seed and become a true relic keeper is earned by her prior experimentation and desperation. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("learned to fail forward") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) from failed guardian to true relic keeper, landing on the page with the cost of a transformed worldview. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through a cadence shift as her melody braids the worlds, culminating in the figure's appearance and gift. The persistent constraint of her past failure shapes her tactics. The orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kessa's perception (e.g., "silence so profound it seemed to press against her eardrums"). The canyon and mountains function as a micro-setting, their hush and silence actively constraining the scene's soundscape and charging the final image as a "benediction." A minor cap is applied as the setting, while impactful, does not narrowly constrain a specific choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by Kessa's agency in playing the new song, creating a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of understanding. The cost is the irrevocable reconfiguration of her purpose and duty, felt in the final image. Pressure coheres and deepens from the shimmering air to the woven space and the figure's materialization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming failure into a new way of connecting emerges organically from the specific event of playing the flute to weave, not seal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "sometimes the best way to guard a threshold is to transform it into a doorway." This reweights all prior material without moralizing, arising from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embodied in Kessa's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("avalanchingly quiet"). The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (the exact song) is taught and pays off. A single, very minor instance of potential filter-verb stacking ("seemed to press") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, a few phrases verge on overwriting ("avalanchingly quiet," "thunder-echo range") and create a slight figurative muddle, though they remain legible. There are no loops or scaffold issues. The minor artifacts do not touch the closure beat but prevent a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a relic keeper discovering her tool's true purpose is transformed through the specific, non-obvious concept of weaving instead of sealing. The synthesis of failure, revelation, and a non-antagonistic Other Place feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a quiet, introspective climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
