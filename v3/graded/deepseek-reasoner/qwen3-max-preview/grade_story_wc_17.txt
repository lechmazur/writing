<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation ("to discover what walls dream about") is concrete, particular, and intensifies under pressure. Her final choice to leave her sketch is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values—witnessing over recording—with a visible, felt cost. The trait "sensitively perceptive" is embodied, not labeled, constraining her actions and enabling the discovery. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her purpose shifts from mapping to witnessing, reconfiguring the stakes with undeniable cost ("her satchel lighter, her heart heavier"). The structure is a single, continuous scene with one meaningful tightening—the discovery of the diaries—that deepens the knowledge state. Causality is clean; every beat arises from her perceptive trait and goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and collapsed antechamber are not just described but actively pressure the choice to pause and listen. The fireplace and diaries function as a micro-setting that constrains the final action of leaving the sketch. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her professional POV ("listened—not with ears, but with the hollow behind her ribs"). The environment subtly mirrors the internal state of buried grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to kneel and listen leads to the discovery, which deepens the stake from academic curiosity to sacred witnessing. The cost is legible on the page in the final beat—the physical lightness of the satchel contrasted with the emotional weight of the heart. The dominant stake (discovering what walls remember) is tested and transformed by the found object.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of reading the diaries, not statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of legacy's burden: it is "meant to be passed on—lightly, tenderly." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as placing her sketch beside the diaries as an offering. The piece avoids moralizing, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply internal, and filtered through a distinct perceptual signature ("the whisper of leaves brushing stone"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. The single character's voice is consistent and specific, with a professional lexicon that feels earned. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that supports the contemplative mood. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("curled like a sleeping serpent," "like unborn birds"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a "corridor echo cartographer" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of post-climate shift worldbuilding with a deeply personal, almost mystical vocation is organic and singular. The story commits fully to its premise, and the emotional truth of grappling with collective grief feels specific and durable, not trendy.</comment>
