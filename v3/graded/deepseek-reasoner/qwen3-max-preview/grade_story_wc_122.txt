<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's deafness is embodied through tactile perception ("fingertips pressed to drumskins," "vibrations trembling up her spine"), not labeled. Her internal conflict—fear of numbness versus the drive to create—compels the risky experiment with the backward song, a high-stakes choice that reveals her values. The final endurance, carrying the void as "potential," is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the students' transformed reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern breaks (the glitching phonograph) until the final resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with cost—the "luminous" silence and the needle as a "scalpel" on the drum. Orientation is immediate and functional; the closure unit is legible and transforms the initial premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern is a crucible that constrains and charges every choice: its acoustics enable the "sympathetic resonance," the "resin and burnt sage" smell grounds the sensory world, and the hanging drums become active participants in the climax. The broken needle, a micro-setting object, decisively shapes the final image and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to play the backward song is a meaningful tightening that fractures the controlled quiet, forcing raw presence into the open. The cost is legible in the veteran's tears and the girl's arrhythmic laughter, altering the therapeutic stakes from stitching to provocation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: the "filament of hush" is not stated but enacted, transforming from fragile stillness to a resilient, collective tool. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to numbness through the image of the world "reversed, ready to be felt," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptual signature—noticing "vibrations," "dust motes," and "unseen pulses." The prose rhythm is controlled and purposefully modulates with pressure, from the lyrical opening to the staccato glitches of the phonograph. Any elision (e.g., the grandfather's attic) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but purposeful, with high information density ("cedar staves curved like ribs"). Minor register drift in "unspool sorrow" feels voice-motivated. The final paragraph's syntax accelerates effectively, and there are no loops or scaffolds that obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, backward music, and trauma therapy is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in the glitch aesthetics heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
