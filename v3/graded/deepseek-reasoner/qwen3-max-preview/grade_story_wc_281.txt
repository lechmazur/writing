<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elira's affectionate skepticism is embodied through concrete somatic choices under pressure, driving key turns like her decision to trust Mateo's whisper. Her internal conflict between logic and somatic intuition is dramatized simultaneously, not summarized. The final renunciation of chemical telepathy for somatic communion is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through somatic and sensory patterns to a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where artificial connections are repriced as somatic. Closure lands with cost at "Tears traced warm paths down her cheeks, but she smiled." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as a micro-setting that constrains and enables choices, supplying tools like the oscilloscope and synth. The muscovite geode charges the final image and shapes tactics. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Elira's professional and somatic priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increases in somatic markers and sensory feedback, culminating in the final frequency resonance. Agency is demonstrated through her active tracing and device patching. Cost is legible in her emotional release and the foreclosed path of chemical telepathy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between artificial chemical connection and earned somatic communion, resolved through the final image of "painting the air with somatic glyphs." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise through Mateo's recalled insight about "feeling their shape."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward somatic and sensory processing. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in peak beats like "She pressed the geode to her sternum." No head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language like "frozen lightning" and "willowglass hope" is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with somatic cues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of telepathy recall with somatic navigation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail (oscilloscope, analog synth) anchors the fresh concept. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
