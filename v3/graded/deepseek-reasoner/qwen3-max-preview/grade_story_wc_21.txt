<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and deep, rooted in a desire for truth over glory. Her micro-choices, like arranging debris, reveal her values. However, interior contradiction under peak stress is more stated than shown through embodied, simultaneous impulses, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archivist becomes the living archive, with cost legible in her tears and altered state. The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building through pattern and cadence shifts. The ending image reweights all prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is the quintessential micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV. The zeppelin library, while evocative, functions more as atmosphere than a constraint, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is masterful under the accumulative lens, driven by the protagonist's agency. Each failed attempt and subsequent tactical shift deepens the stakes. The cost is unmistakably felt in the climax as she kneels, weeping, her entire being reconfigured by the encounter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of historical memory and truth emerges organically from concrete actions and the central conflict. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to its central question, reweighting the concept of an archive itself without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and any elision (e.g., the diary's exact contents) is purposeful and pays off in the final, sensation-based revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("shimmering like spilled ink," "pressed its palm") which, while beautiful, briefly risks ornamentation before the narrative solidifies its purpose-driven style.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of concept, character, and setting. The premise of a "parley" with a lagoon to decrypt grief through resonance is fresh and specific. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
