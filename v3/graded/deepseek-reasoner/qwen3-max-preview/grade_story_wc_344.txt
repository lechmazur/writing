<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("fingers... trembled not from cold but anticipation"). The final renunciation—choosing understanding over restoration—is earned by the sequence of reflective mirror visions, showing a credible endurance with a visible cost (the apron's glow dimming, the gears left behind).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered memory and revelation. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she becomes a "keeper of quiet mendings," a decisive change with a clear, felt cost of surrender. The final image reconfigures her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are not just vivid but actively constrain and charge every choice. The setting is the crucible; the mirrors force the confrontation with memory, and the gears on the glacial glass pedestal are the central object that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens from a personal quest to a profound thematic choice. The pressure deepens via the mirror's painful revelations, forcing the final, cost-heavy stance crystallization: understanding over fixing. Agency is clear in her whispered answer and tracing the pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific events and final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of repair. The conclusion that "repair is not restoration, but reharmonization" is earned, profound, and avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through the character's perceptual signature. The voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, precise rhythm that supports the accumulative mode. The prose texture is consistently immersive and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with strong rhythmic control. Minor density issues: a few phrases ("driftwood nostalgia," "liquid clarity") border on decorative. However, the language is purposeful and propulsive, with no artifacts harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a locksmith, a frozen library, and a hall of mirrors that reflects memory is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed concept. The specific choices in character and world create a singular and memorable perspective that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
