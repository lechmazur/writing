<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in diaspora return and reverence, intensifying through micro-choices like brushing moss and excavating with care. Her warmly curious trait is embodied, not labeled, driving actions that carry cost (e.g., roots steadying her wrists). The final endurance—staying to tend the rhythm—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and the villagers' return. Minor deduction for slight idealization; her struggle is genuine but lacks deep internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the sundial's alignment and chime reorient faith and time, with cost felt in Elara's weeping and the orchard's sigh. Causality is tight: each dig reveals context, leading to the dial's displacement realization. Pattern is taught early ("purposeful wandering") and pays off. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the catacomb orchard constrains choices (roots threading bones, guiding her digs) and charges the final image (petals spiraling, roots cradling). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("gnarled roots between femurs," "scent of damp loam"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment evolving through her actions. The sundial base acts as a micro-setting that redefines options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith through reorientation) is signaled early and escalates through accumulative deepening—each artifact discovery narrows her understanding and tactics. Agency is clear: her digging and stone-fitting drive the escalation, with cost legible in the orchard's approval (roots steadying her) and the final chime. No coincidence; pressure coheres under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (faith as rhythm, not monument) emerges organically through particulars like the sundial's alignment and the villagers' return with seeds. Subtext operates in images (petals falling upward, roots as guides) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "time itself learned to bloom again." No thematic echo or summary; complexity is embraced through ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature ("the catacomb orchard breathed in twilight"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (e.g., short sentences in peak beats: "She wept."). No head-hopping; elision (e.g., war backstory) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is absent but not required; internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional (e.g., "roots like fingers reclaiming prayers"). Minor overwriting risk in phrases like "faith by fragment" but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolds; sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating toward the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of catacomb and orchard, diaspora and faith, with fresh inflections (e.g., petals falling upward). Tropes are transformed through grounded choices (rebuilding as listening, not plundering). The core concept (interrupted journeys) is indispensable, shaping the narrative arc and closure. Bold risk-taking in lyrical density pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
