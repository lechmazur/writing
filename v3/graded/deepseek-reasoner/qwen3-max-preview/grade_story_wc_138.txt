<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The immortal's motivation is clear and rooted in his specific, eons-deep ennui, compelling his high-stakes choice. His final wonder is earned by the scene's causality. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("Immortality had sandpapered awe into ennui") that abstracts his state, though it is quickly re-anchored in embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the immortal steps into a new state of wonder, with the cost of his former refuge felt in its collapse. The spatial mutiny escalates coherently from the storm's magnetic peak to the amulet's blossoming, all serving the final, legible image of the "plain where every step echoed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and the solar storm are not just vivid backdrops; they are active, constraining elements. The sanctuary's collapse is a direct cost of the ritual, and the storm's ferocity is the essential catalyst that makes the spatial mutiny possible, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a single, powerful cadence shift: the transition from the amulet's vibration to the full "spatial mutiny." This is driven by the immortal's agency in aligning the fragment with the storm, and the cost—the loss of his sanctuary—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>The theme of seeking meaning in finality emerges organically from the immortal's specific quest and the accumulated weight of the "whispers" of goodbyes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the "quiet thunder of endings"—that reweights his entire existence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply immersed in the immortal's perceptive signature, which is distinct, poetic, and consistent even under peak pressure. The voice's elevated register is wholly motivated by his ancient, jaded character, and the patterned elision (e.g., "gravity apologized and stepped aside") is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates with the mutiny. A single, minor artifact occurs in the peak beat: "time hiccuped" is a slightly mixed metaphor that briefly muddles the otherwise precise physical logic of the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bored immortal, a spatially sentient object, and a cosmic storm into a quest for resonance past goodbye is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "spatial mutiny" is a specific, non-obvious risk that fully integrates with the stakes and closure, heightening meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
