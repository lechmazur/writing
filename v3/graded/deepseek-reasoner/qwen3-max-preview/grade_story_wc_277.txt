<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character is sharply defined through concrete micro-choices (adjusting the telescope, documenting the smoke) and embodied emotion ("smiled—not with joy, but with solemn playfulness"). Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving the high-stakes choice to release the evidence. The final act feels earned by prior causality, with the pen's weight serving as a visible cost of her enduring commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, held perfectly. Closure is a decisive change (evidence released, story shattered) with clear cost (the weight of the promise, the "dark thread" of reckoning). The journalist's call incites a because/therefore chain of investigation that culminates in the Q.E.D. action. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory and modified telescope are not just atmospheric but actively constrain and enable the protagonist's choice, functioning as the crucial tool for her intervention. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("cold metal," "smoldering like embers"), filtered through her professional, observant POV. The setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: her investigation tightens from observation to action, culminating in the release of proof. The dominant stake (truth vs. erasure) is signaled early and paid off with a clear, on-page cost. The final choice forecloses the path of silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of character, object (pen), and method (proof by contradiction), resisting moralizing. The final image ("a dark thread stitching sky to earth, regret to reckoning") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of cyclical corruption versus breaking orbits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptive, analytical texture that mirrors the protagonist's devotion to observation. POV is stable and deeply embedded. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is masterful, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity ("orbits of regret," "bureaucratic fog"). Sentence-level rhythm expertly modulates to match the protagonist's focused intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a newsprint heiress, proof by contradiction, and a modified telescope feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept ("orbits of regret") is transformed from a thematic echo into a narrative constraint that shapes the protagonist's tactics and the story's structure.</comment>
