<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure ("She closed her eyes, not to pray, but to tune — not by adjusting dials or recalibrating gain, but by discarding assumptions"). The final renunciation of her initial goal is earned by causality, with visible cost in the dissolution of the fragment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the city awakens, reconfiguring the premise from ruin to instrument. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through density and pattern to a decisive cadence shift. Cost is legible in the fragment's dissolution and the irreversible change in the city's state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The rusted tower city and gorge are tactile and pressure the action. The radio tower's mechanics ("buried capacitors recharging") directly enable the closure, transforming the environment from passive backdrop to active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her act of discarding assumptions triggers the city's awakening. The stakes transform from personal quest to communal restoration, with the cost of the fragment's dissolution legible on the page. Pressure coheres and deepens through a single, meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding genesis in endings emerges organically from the protagonist's journey and the fragment's transformation. The final image of the city "broadcasting the sound of genesis" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the Hollywood fragment's irony and the revaluation of failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical, precise rhythm ("a tremor in the fabric between moments") modulates with emotional intensity and supports the Accumulative drive. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level control with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and coherent ("a shard of hush so pure it carved silence into the air like a blade"). Syntax and rhythm accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs, creating immense propulsion without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of cosmic and cinematic themes, transformed through specific, grounded choices. The concept of "fantasy practicality" is executed with full commitment, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight, arising from established character and pattern.</comment>
