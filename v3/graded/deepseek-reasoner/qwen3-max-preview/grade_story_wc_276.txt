<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fisher's transliteration ability is concretely embodied and drives micro-choices under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. Her cool-headedness is a consistent trait that intensifies to compel higher-stakes choices, and her final act of releasing the echo rather than capturing it is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost, the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and the rail spike's persistent constraint shapes the final image. The deliberate early disorientation serves the closure effect and is therefore waived from penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and the rail spike function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the fisher's professional POV, with the environment evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the fisher's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from calibrated steps to the decisive, costly act of slamming the spike. The cost is unmistakably legible on the page in the garden's shuddering and the spike's destruction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief and rebirth through the image of the constellations shifting to gold. Theme emerges organically from the fisher's specific actions and the reconfiguration of the echo, avoiding moralizing or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, even under peak pressure. The purposeful elision and figurative language are taught early and paid off at closure, contributing to the piece's unique texture without causing head-hopping or confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical with masterful rhythm, though occasional moments of figurative stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "geyser of broken glass") create minor muddle without obscuring causality. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic mythology, grief, and a fisher's vocation is a specific, non-obvious, and fully committed premise. Bold risk-taking in the poetic, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, and the closure effect remains perfectly legible.</comment>
