<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The keeper's internal contradiction (scattered memory vs. mission) is embodied under pressure; her final transformation into "the loom" is earned by her choice to hum a half-remembered tune, a micro-choice that forecloses her isolation with visible cost as she weeps with recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the realm holds itself through song; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pattern density until the mica windows crack with release. Cost is legible in the keeper's weeping and the realm's softened night.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is not just vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the finale; the mica windows are a micro-setting that hoards light until the keeper's action forces their release, directly causing the decisive change. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the keeper's agency under the Accumulative lens; her decision to hum invites others, creating a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (communal hope) with unmistakable cost—the physical cracking of the windows and the emotional release of weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory emerges entirely through event and image ("swaddle," "loom," "woven dawns"); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting the concept of silence versus song with profound cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that remains coherent under pressure. Purposeful compression ("not as warmth, but as recognition") and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is flawless, with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("fireflies pinned behind crystal"); sentences propel the accumulative momentum without a single loop or scaffold obscuring the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical greenhouse, memory-as-light, and song-as-weaving is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded particulars.</comment>
