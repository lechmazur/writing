<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirror maker's motivation is clear and deeply rooted; her understanding of dreams as glass reveals character-specific worldview. The final choice to become a medium through breath rather than force is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fog's return. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently particular and avoid stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where boundaries dissolve, landing with felt cost as the fog thickens again. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through rhythmic breathing and sensory density. The broken sextant's role is taught and pays off, though the astronomer's regret feels slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the ruined orchard and thick fog constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional bias (e.g., "smelled of rust, wet bark, and ozone — the scent of thresholds thinning"). The environment actively shapes the ritual's execution and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through the breathing method that thins the fog and draws the dream. Cost is legible in the frost's pulse and the dream's willing capture. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient, though the stakes could feel more visceral earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries between sleep/wake, lost/found emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the dream flowing into the mirror. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "She had once been that child") without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature sharpened by professional detail ("grinding silver-backed glass"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, particularly in the breathing cadence. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring causality. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful (e.g., "apple trees stood like petrified sentinels"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the ritual's rhythm. Minor artifact: "glass mountains" tone reference feels slightly decorative but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-catching, broken instruments, and breath-based magic feels inevitable. Specificity in details (sextant's fractured arcs, dream's mercury eyes) avoids tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
