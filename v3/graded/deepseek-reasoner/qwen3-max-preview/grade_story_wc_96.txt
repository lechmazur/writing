<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Molt's sardonic shell and subsequent molt into a "gardener of the impossible" is a profound, earned internal change. Her contradictory impulses are shown in scene (laughing sharply at Elias's words that "stuck like burrs"). The final choice to plant seeds and sing is a micro-choice that reveals a complete hierarchy-of-values shift, rooted in the specific cost of her grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of the candle burning, the seeds planted, and her song turning "decay into a kind of cathedral" reconfigures the premise of rebuilding with undeniable conceptual cost. The lens holds from the opening accumulation of imagery to this crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The rusted library is not a backdrop but an active crucible that constrains and charges every choice. Its "open ribs" and "shattered skylight" frame the action, and the floorboards literally receive the seeds, making the setting indispensable to the closure. Sensory details are filtered through Molt's poetic, ink-stained perception, avoiding cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is accumulative, driven by the weight of Elias's poem and Molt's grief, culminating in her active choice to plant seeds and sing. The stake—rebuilding belief—transforms from a abstract goal to a concrete, visceral act. The cost is the shedding of her cynical "skin," felt on the page. A minor deduction as the external pressure from the setting is static, though internally coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of "blooming resistance" is fully integrated, emerging from the particulars of the prison library, the smuggled poem, and the act of planting seeds in ruin. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how beauty is forged from anarchy, without a hint of moralizing. The concept is repriced from destruction to tender cultivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a sardonic, poetic lexicon that remains consistent under pressure. The prose is a character in itself, with a rhythmic, almost liturgical quality that peaks in the final paragraph ("moonlight stitching the fractures"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Molt's specific perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary, with high information density and rhythmic control. Most sentences serve multiple functions. A single, minor artifact exists: the metaphor "liquid starlight" for pooled wax is slightly strained, creating a momentary coherence hiccup in an otherwise flawless peak beat. This prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a vagrant poet, a prison library, and planting wildflower seeds in ruin is fresh, inevitable, and高度 original. The core concept of "blooming resistance" is transformed from a theme into a specific, lived action. The story takes bold risks with its lyrical, accumulative structure that pay off in a powerful and singular closing image.</comment>
