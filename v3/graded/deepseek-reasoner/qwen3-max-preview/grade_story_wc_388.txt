<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and particular, with motivation rooted in a clear, consistent trait ("sharply observant") that drives micro-choices and culminates in a final decision to continue her mission. The final choice to walk east is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing safety for a path of greater cost and purpose, charged by the tactile discovery of the plaque. Contradictory impulses are shown in scene, such as her smile being "not in triumph, but in sorrow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis that reconfigures the protagonist's purpose, landing with undeniable conceptual cost on the page ("for every orchard like this buried under lies"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, as pattern recognition and reassembly of clues escalate pressure toward the final discovery. A persistent constraint—the diamond's flawed design—shapes the final tactics and image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is a masterclass in micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The environment is not decorative; the tree's growth rings aligned with storm cycles directly enable the protagonist's discovery. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through a professional POV ("intuiting patterns in the scars"). The orchard itself is the central antagonist and crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to physical action (pressing the diamond into the soil) which creates a decisive, on-page change in the environment. The cost is legible in the sorrow of her realization and the foreclosed path of safety. The dominant stake (excavating truth) is tested and deepened by each discovered pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and the protagonist's actions, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of truth versus comfortable lies. The final image of the diamond beating "like a second heart—flawed, yes, but alive, and fiercely, stubbornly, uncursed" reprices the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice exhibits a distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control, with a lexicon and syntax that perfectly match the protagonist's analytical yet poetic mind. The pattern of reassembly (of letters, of truth) is taught early and paid off flawlessly at closure. POV is stable and deeply internal, with no head-hopping. The prose is consistently sharp and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. The rhythm varies masterfully, accelerating with discovery and breathing in moments of revelation. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs ("The diamond pulsed faintly in her palm, warm now, as if recognizing its purpose—or hers").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a "stillpoint" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic and ecological tropes, transformed through specific, grounded world logic and a unique moral calculus. The story commits fully to its premise, and the protagonist's singular voice and perspective feel authentically realized. Risk-taking in the accumulative, pattern-based structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
