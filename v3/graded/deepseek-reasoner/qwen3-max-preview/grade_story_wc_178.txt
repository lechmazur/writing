<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("knees protesting," "fingers trembled—not from age"). Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in an earned renunciation of worldly comfort for cosmic clarity. The final endurance is a credible Earned Stasis with visible cost ("sold his winter cloak," "ate barley cakes").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost, landing cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The inferred lens holds, and a persistent constraint (frugality, isolation) shapes the final image. A minor orientation debt in the first paragraph (slightly delayed "who") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The "crumbling ziggurat," "obsidian floor," and "creeping ivy" are filtered through the POV's professional bias and directly enable the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deliberate, patient act of sketching schematics. The cost of his devotion is legible on the page in the sacrifices listed ("sold his winter cloak"). The stake (communion with cosmic order) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "encrypted devotion," resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the "dormant god" whose power is in "delicate, deliberate alignment." The integration of math and mysticism is complex and avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the astronomer's rational yet devotional worldview. The voice is consistent and modulates with pressure, employing a lyrical, precise register that fits the character. There is no head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight register elevation in "empirically ironic perfection" that, while voice-motivated, borders on the POV's lexicon limit. Otherwise, sentences are concise, propel momentum, and avoid loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian setting, mathematical magic, and a protagonist driven by "encrypted devotion" is a specific, non-obvious, and inevitable-feeling combination. The core premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed without retreat, resulting in a singular artistic stance that feels authentically fresh.</comment>
