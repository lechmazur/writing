<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in embodied contradiction—rebellious exile versus a deep need for connection. The final choice to teach is earned by her prior journey of self-inscription. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstraction in peak emotional beats (e.g., "skin met soul").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through lyrical density toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure is potent and on-page, with the final image of the child offering a dandelion clock providing a clear, felt cost of her transformation from fugitive to guide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The twilight garden is not merely backdrop; it actively pressures and enables her choices, functioning as a crucible. The moss, folding petals, and star-strewn sky are tactile details that constrain her dance and charge the final image, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal rebellion to communal revolution, driven by her agency. The discovery of the moonstone speck is a key tightening, forcing the higher-stakes choice to inscribe rather than escape. The cost is legible in her bleeding feet and completed exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</theme><comment>Theme of memory as contraband versus compass emerges organically from action and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live under oppression. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit phrase "memory was no longer contraband but compass."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and consistently filtered through the dancer's perception. POV is stable and deeply internal. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction that slightly distances the reader from raw immediacy in high-pressure beats (e.g., "gravitational sighs and stellar sighs").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. A few instances of near-synonym churn ("cosmic verse," "cosmic hymn") and a single mixed metaphor ("vessel launching verses") prevent a higher score, though clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of elegiac lyricism with a sci-fi conceit (nostalgia ban) is fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded particulars, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
