<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tracer's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied profession. Her "persistent curiosity" is shown through action, not told. However, her internal contradiction under pressure is minimal; she is highly competent and her final choice, while compassionate, lacks a significant, character-specific cost or struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds strongly: the photograph's pulse leads to the discovery, which prompts the tracer's method, resulting in a decisive change for the girl. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for the girl, a successful completion for the tracer) with clear, felt cost in the girl's tears and acceptance. The structure is taut and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a masterclass in atmospheric, purposeful setting. It is not merely a backdrop but actively pressures the action with its shadows, wet stone, and isolating grandeur. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings that crucially constrain and enable the tracer's choices, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the causal lens: she actively tunes the device and follows the pulse, which tightens from a search to an urgent rescue. The dominant stake (resolving a haunting echo) is clear and the cost—the emotional weight of delivering difficult truth—is legible in the final, quiet interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from the core concept and specific events, exploring how love echoes and how quiet acts answer profound calls. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency") that reweights the story's premise without moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is concrete and lasting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through the tracer's professional, melancholic perception, creating a distinct and consistent voice. The prose has a lyrical, rhythmic control that modulates perfectly with the story's emotional pressure. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the opening paragraph ("marble veined with forgotten histories") which, while beautiful, leans ornamental. The climax and closure beats, however, are clear, concise, and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of an emotional resonance tracer is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of the supernatural and the profoundly human. It feels organic and is executed with high conceptual integrity, fully committing to its premise and implications. The specific details (hearing aid, photograph) create memorable originality.</comment>
