<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific, embodied in the tracing of the quill holder. The "calmly inventive" trait is demonstrated through meticulous planning. However, the emotional state is somewhat monolithic; a moment of contradictory impulse (e.g., fear of discovery) would elevate it further. The final endurance is credible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the dawn arrives and the revolution's "tinder is laid." The cost is the sentinel's risk and the weight of her silent, patient work. The structure is a single, coherent scene with a clear before (preparation) and after (dissemination) state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional focus. The sundial and quill holder function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. A minor weakness: the fort's spatial layout (ramparts to courtyard to corridor) is somewhat implied rather than fully choreographed, but it does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a cadence shift from preparation to execution. The dominant stake (sparking the revolution) is signaled early and tightens with the act of tracing and disseminating the map. The cost is the palpable risk of discovery by the guards, which alters her tactics (timing steps to the clock, using the service corridor).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of silent, patient rebellion emerges organically from the specific actions and objects. The final image of the baker, scribe, and stablehand understanding offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The "cradle of sparks" concept is integrated as a motivating force, not a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, poetic voice that modulates under pressure ("winking hush," "silver seep"). The prose is highly controlled, with a rhythmic quality that supports the quiet, deliberate tone. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with excellent rhythm and varied syntax. A single minor artifact: the phrase "geometric ciphers only the initiated could read" slightly explains what is already shown. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, with every sentence advancing mood and story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The premise of a revolution waged with geometry is highly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of a military sentinel, a sundial, and coded angles feels inevitable and fresh. The risk of a quiet, accumulative plot is taken and succeeds, heightening the stakes through specificity.</comment>
