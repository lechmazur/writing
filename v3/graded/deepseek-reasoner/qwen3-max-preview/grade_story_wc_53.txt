<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vividly dramatized through the ghost and the protagonist's daily fracture. The final choice to relinquish the camera and receive the envelope is a credible endurance earned by the prior causality of her collecting. The cost is felt in the final line's shift from regret to acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through collected fragments until the ghost's final gesture reconfigures the protagonist's understanding of her task. The final image of the note ("frame it, not fix it") lands with clear cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. The kinetic lagoon's eerie suspension, the salt-crusted planks, and the central spire are not backdrop but active pressure. The disposable camera functions as a micro-setting, its use evolving to become the mechanism of closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens. Her choice to collect fragments and confront the ghost tightens the pressure, culminating in the ghost's demand to "develop this." The cost is legible in the relinquishment of the camera and the ghost's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of regret versus acceptance emerges organically from the protagonist's actions and the lagoon's logic. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the note's message, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. The final image of sitting without regret is earned through the specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The first-person POV has a distinct, consistent perceptual signature, with a lyrical yet grounded voice that modulates under pressure. The prose's rhythm and diction are meticulously controlled, and purposeful elision (e.g., the contradictory memories) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("like breath caught mid-sigh") is pattern-taught and serves the atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a kinetic lagoon, a personal ghost, and a disposable camera is a fresh, non-obvious angle on regret and memory. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
