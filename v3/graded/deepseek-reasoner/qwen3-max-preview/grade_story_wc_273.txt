<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tracker's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her to a decisive, earned choice. Her "serene anger" is embodied and specific, with micro-choices (spilling ink, pressing it to her temples) revealing her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is credible and carries visible cost as she vanishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (time slows for the witness, not the world) that lands on the page with cost (her disappearance). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern density (ink, time, perception) escalating to a final, inevitable reconfiguration. The ending image (Ghostwing alone, burning with data) makes the cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and the ink itself function as micro-settings that pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "ink’s scent faintly metallic, like ozone after lightning"), filtered through the tracker's professional perception. The environment constrains her action and evolves causally with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her experimentation with the ink deepens her understanding and narrows her options to one final, costly choice. The stake (discovering why time slows) is signaled early and tested concretely. The cost of her revelation is her physical dissolution, felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme (time as a subjective, protective mechanism) emerges organically from the tracker's specific struggle and the ink's behavior. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of her disappearance, which reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("time thickened in crisis, stretched like taffy"). The prose's lyrical, compressed syntax reflects the tracker's focused intensity. There is no head-hopping; all elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of vanishing) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and propulsion, with high information density ("a Rorschach of impermanence"). Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("heart hammering not from fear but from revelation") slightly risks register drift but does not obscure causality or closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of time perception and material science (ink). The tracker's specific, grounded choices transform a potential trope into a singular vision. The risk-taking (lyricism, conceptual climax) heightens stakes and coherence, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
