<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is visceral and clear, rooted in childhood backstory that perfectly justifies her quest. Her methodical curiosity is shown through specific actions (comparing footage, overlaying sequences). The final choice to simply witness is a credible Earned Stasis. A minor deduction as her "methodically curious" trait could be more actively constrained in the present scene, but her embodied emotion and micro-choices are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and held beautifully, building pattern density toward a profound Conceptual Repricing of silence. Closure is a masterful Charged Poise, with the shadow forming the chapel's silhouette—a resonant reconfiguration that lands with undeniable cost. The only hairline slip is the lens not being explicitly taught in the very first beats, but it coheres by the midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional, purposeful specificity. The vault, henge, and map are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment is a character: the "weeping" arches, the "cartographic wound," and the central menhir all pressure the protagonist's actions and culminate in the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and perfectly filtered through her professional, empathetic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens—her act of overlaying footage and tracing the shadow's path is the key tightening that narrows options and leads to the climax. The cost of her patient, years-long quest is felt. A minor deduction as the final beat is more passive witnessing than an active choice under pressure, though it is a valid renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of silence as a vessel, not a void, is perfectly integrated and emerges entirely from events and images, never stated. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the entire narrative. The final image of the chapel "breathing—invisibly, audibly, eternally" is a masterclass in earned thematic resonance without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains controlled under pressure. The perceptual signature—noticing "gradients of shade, patience of stone"—is character-specific and consistent. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("shielded openness," "heart unarmored yet guarded by awe") slightly risks register drift but does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shielded openness, heart unarmored yet guarded by awe"). These minor artifacts slightly dull the immediate clarity of the closure image, preventing a 9+ score, but the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of cartography, archaeology, and spiritual quest. The core concept—a chapel preserved by silence and revealed through the choreography of a shadow—is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without a trace of gimmickry. A singular artistic vision.</comment>
