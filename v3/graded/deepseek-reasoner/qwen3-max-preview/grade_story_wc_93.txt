<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with the curse's emotional cost ("stole surprise, stole awe") grounding his motivation. His final understanding is earned through on-page struggle and the grandmother's memory, a decisive change with visible cost. The contradiction between his initial view of the curse and its final transformation is handled in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as his curse transforms into a tool for seeing patterns, a decisive change legible on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through the intensifying pattern of rocks, eels, and aurora. The cost is felt in the lingering promise being "transformed," not fulfilled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora are not just backdrop; they actively pressure the herder's choices and supply the essential resource of the eels. The painted rocks are a micro-setting that constrains his actions and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the herder's agency under the accumulative lens, as each rock placement deepens the pattern and summons the eels. The cost is legible in the final transformation of his curse and the dissolution of the eels. The dominant stake (understanding) is signaled early and meaningfully tightens through this process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of patterns versus promises emerges organically from the grandmother's wisdom and the herder's struggle, culminating in the resonant, non-literal realization that he was given "the method to ask better questions." The final image of the humming rocks offers a profound answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through the herder's curse and professional knowledge. The prose's rhythm and lyrical quality are perfectly controlled and modulate with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping; the single focalization is clean and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("ribbons of emerald and violet pulsed across the sky, not as spectacle but as scripture"). Rhythm is varied and propulsive, with sentence structures that beautifully mirror the accumulating patterns. Zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a precognitive curse, vanished friction, and sacred eel-herding is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and followed to its logical, beautiful conclusion. The specific, verifiable detail (Fibonacci arcs, painted rocks) creates immense freshness without quirkiness.</comment>
