<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation for self-forgiveness is clear, rooted in specific guilt over abandoning her sister. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., fingers brushing accordion, weeping). The final choice to map "through the heart of her own neglect" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her raw weeping. Slight reliance on reflective summary in middle paragraphs, but anchored in present stimuli.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with each graffiti discovery deepening emotional stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she reconfigures her path inward at "Point Zero," with cost felt in her weeping and the station's shift. Orientation is clear within first 120 words. The ivy as archive and final station shift subtly support closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and constrains choices—ivy reads as archive, graffiti provides clues, station's emptiness pressures her isolation. The accordion and maps function as micro-settings, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "air thick with moss and memory," "wheezing gasps"). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) escalates through accumulative discoveries of graffiti, each deepening emotional pressure. Agency is clear in her methodical documentation and final decision to map her neglect. Cost is legible in her weeping and the accordion's "less broken" song. One meaningful tightening occurs at "Point Zero," narrowing her focus inward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges organically through concrete images (maps, graffiti, accordion). Subtext operates in graffiti phrases like "Maps lie unless you draw them bleeding," avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the resonant image of the station shifting for her healing. Wisdom is earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice. Diction and syntax reflect her introspective nature ("emotional topography," "contour lines of shame"). No head-hopping. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Dialogue is absent but not needed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains clarity and momentum. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, accelerating with emotional intensity. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "wheezed like regret"). Peak beats remain clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mapping emotional landscapes through physical clues. The accordion and graffiti are fresh, irreplaceable elements. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise feels organic and fully committed.</comment>
