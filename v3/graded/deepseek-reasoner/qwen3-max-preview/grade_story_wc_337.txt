<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The restorer's motivation ("balance") is clear, rooted in a specific worldview, and intensifies under pressure. Her final choice to continue the work is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing personal peace with a visible cost. Embodied emotion and micro-choices, like the hesitation at the blackened knot, reveal a complex hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is taught immediately and held perfectly. Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the sanctuary's final sigh and the restorer's steady shadow signal a world made lighter, with the cost of her endless labour felt on the page. The structure is a masterful, single-scene accumulation of released silences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is indispensable, not just atmospheric; its crystallized silence is the medium for the entire ritual. The net and needle are micro-settings that concretely constrain every action. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the character's goal-directed work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a flawless, relentless deepening of stakes through each unknotted memory. The dominant stake (grounding spirits to restore balance) is signaled early and tightens with the discovery and piercing of the blackened knot, a clear and dangerous intensification. The cost of each release is viscerally legible in the sighs and flickers that shake the sanctuary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept that silence is layered and must be tended. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer: healing is found not in erasure but in release, and the work is endless. The final image of the "future... still knotted" resonates with complex, earned meaning, avoiding any moralizing summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a perfect fusion of lyrical precision and thematic purpose. The POV is stable and deeply embedded in the restorer's perceptual signature—her way of seeing silence as a substance to be stitched and unraveled. The prose's rhythm and diction are flawlessly modulated to the ritual's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is pristine. The prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with every image advancing character and stakes. There is zero scaffolding or looped phrasing. Figurative language ("cathedral of captured starlight," "silence like dust") is consistent, vivid, and never muddles clarity, even at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core concept of a restorer who mends broken masks by unknotting nets of silence is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of a tangible ritual with a metaphysical premise feels inevitable and is executed with breathtaking specificity. The risk of high-concept lyricism pays off entirely in coherence and emotional power.</comment>
