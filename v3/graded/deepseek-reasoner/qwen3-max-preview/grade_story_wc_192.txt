<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice—stepping through the threshold—is earned by prior causality and a visible cost, as seen in the line "letting the chill seep into her bones like a vow."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive Conceptual Repricing, reconfiguring the sanctuary's meaning into an "expanse: a field of unlit lanterns." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure cohering through sensory density and pattern breaks that reweight the dominant stake of healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The "ashen charcoal sanctuary" and "doorknocker ring" are tactile, purposeful details that evolve causally, pressuring the protagonist's actions and shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single, meaningful deepening as she "lets the oldest scar...flare open." The cost is unmistakable on the page, foreclosing the path of silence with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of healing through the final image of the "field of unlit lanterns." Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals and embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with any elision taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, though minor overwriting appears in phrases like "burned sugar and old tears," which slightly muddles sensory clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar concepts of healing and closure into a singular, inevitable artistic stance. Bold risk-taking in its lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling both fresh and fully integrated.</comment>
