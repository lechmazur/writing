<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (placing the wing, syncing her breath) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. Her final choice to become a listener is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for interiority that, while rich, could show slightly more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the moment of revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The prophecy's meaning is decisively repriced from a warning of doom to a plea for a guardian, with the cost of her new calling legible in her "resolve." The structure is a single, perfectly paced scene where each beat deepens the central stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The brook and origami wing function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's choice, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her POV, with the "water’s murmur flowed not as sound but as texture" being a standout line that defines the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency in mapping silence and flowing into the whisper, culminating in the pivotal choice to cradle the prophecy. The stake transforms from silencing a doom to answering a plea, a meaningful deepening with a clear, felt cost—her commitment to return night after night.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to confront ominous futures: not through force but through receptive listening. The final image of her as "the ear the world forgot it needed" is an earned insight that reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose exhibits a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature and impeccable rhythmic control that modulates with pressure ("a velvet void where meaning pooled and clarified"). POV is stable and deeply embedded in the summoner's consciousness. The single whisper from the water is effectively not-voice, maintaining focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful, varied syntax. A very minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in the opening paragraph ("parchment older than the trees," "weight of unsaid futures"), though it quickly coheres into the story's taught pattern and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of prophecy, origami, and listening is a fresh, non-obvious, and inevitable-feeling take on a classic fantasy trope. The core concept of "smoothed hush" is a genuine innovation that fully integrates with character, setting, and stakes, achieving a singular artistic stance.</comment>
