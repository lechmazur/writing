<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is concrete and rooted in a specific, embodied relationship with her daughter, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Her internal conflict—smiling at her daughter's feistiness while feeling the pain of rejection—acts simultaneously, not alternately. The final choice to mend the vow with the ribbon is earned by prior causality, showing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Her hands, calloused from decades of work, are a perfect, specific embodiment of her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through the density of vows and reweighting the dominant stake of connection at closure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the daughter's hesitant return and the mother's renewed hope with undeniable conceptual cost. The structure is a single, coherent scene that teaches its pattern of gathering vows early, and the final image of the green scrap reconfigures the meaning of persistence. The cost is legible on the page in the image of "small, hesitant" footprints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively pressuring choices and supplying resources (vows, fruit, tools) that directly affect the outcome and charge the final image. The cathedral orchard is vividly sensory and purposefully woven into action, such as climbing a ladder "woven from ivy and old hymnals." The environment constrains and enables tactics, as the vow-trees resist retrieval, forcing the mender to use honey. The micro-setting of the daughter's hair ribbon functions as a key object that is charged and reconfigured at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the mender's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from collecting random vows to actively retrieving her daughter's specific, emotionally charged vow. This meaningful deepening changes her knowledge and tactics, culminating in the high-stakes act of stitching it to the ribbon. The cost is unmistakable on the page in her throat tightening and the dream of her daughter's distant, judgmental presence. The pressure coheres and tightens to a single, decisive intensification perfectly scaled to this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of generational wisdom and repair emerges organically from events and images, such as the "deciduous vows" and the act of mending with a "sticky spoon," avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the green scrap, reweighting persistence as a "vow worth mending" without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, like the daughter's footprints and the new ribbon color representing a tentative, new beginning. The core concept is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature, noticing the world through the lens of a mender ("tools dismissed as junk," vows "brittle as birch bark"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity, swelling in the nave "like a forgotten hymn." Purposeful compression is used effectively, such as the elision of the daughter's direct presence, which pays off in the charged closure image. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density; nearly every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere ("vows here resisted easy retrieval"). Rhythm is masterfully controlled, varying to match scene needs, from the slow, deliberate gathering of vows to the quicker, more hopeful ending. A minor deduction for figurative density in one high-pressure beat: "sticky with unresolved emotion" slightly risks mixing metaphor, though it remains legible. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless, with zero loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of "deciduous vows" is a breathtakingly original and non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of a quartz-eye mender, a cathedral orchard, and physical vows is organic and serves character and conflict utterly, not a checklist. The story commits fully to its vision, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical, accumulative design that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional truth and human complexity are paramount, avoiding generic templates for a deeply singular artistic stance.</comment>
