<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The chronicler's interiority is concrete and embodied, her "warmly observant" trait shaping her method of tangential attention. Her final choice to offer presence over answers is a credible Earned Stasis, foreclosing immediate resolution with a visible cost in the companion's slumped shoulders. The companion is less distinct, his internal state inferred rather than shown, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres through sensory density and pattern-building, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where time is conceptually repriced. The final image of the shared pause hums with undeniable cost and possibility. Orientation is immediate and the taught pattern pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's professional bias ("recorded not facts but textures"). The environment pressures the protagonist's method and directly enables her epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's accumulative method, a deepening that changes her knowledge and reweights the dominant stake of their relationship. The cost is legible in the companion's exhale and their shared decision to inhabit the pause. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of the cicada, the tidal method, and the relationship's pause, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about time's granular texture. The final conceptual repricing avoids moralizing, instead landing on a charged image of "sacred, textured threshold" that reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through the chronicler's distinctive perceptual signature ("like memory shards," "vibrated in her molars"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and legible, with rhythm modulating perfectly to match contemplative and peak beats. Dialogue is minimal but carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor artifact occurs in the peak beat: "the ache and awe of thresholds crossed" uses a slightly abstract label-speak pair, creating a small dip in the otherwise concrete sensory flow and preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicling, jade cicada metaphor, and a relationship in transition feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The non-obvious angle on time's texture is executed with full commitment to its lyrical, accumulative premise, and the risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
