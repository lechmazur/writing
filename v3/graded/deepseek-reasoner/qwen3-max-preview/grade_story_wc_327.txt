<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("wept, but did not stop speaking"). Motivation is clear, rooted in profound loss, and intensifies under pressure. The final choice to speak is earned by prior causality, with visible cost ("copper veins shimmered, conducting the sound"). Contradictory impulses (grief and resolve) act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with immense cost and reweights the world. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pattern density until meaning is reconfigured. The final image of the echo moving "forward" is a decisive conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The canyon's echo-property is the story's core mechanic, and the "towers of bone" provide a tactile, pressure-laden environment. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action ("The towers of bone trembled. Not from force, but recognition.").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the textural lens, using the diamond to filter noise. The cost is unmistakable on the page as the curse creates a "vacuum" and the canyon "exhales" new echoes. A single, powerful tightening occurs when she raises the diamond, narrowing her options to a single, decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss and memory. Theme emerges organically from the particular mechanics of the canyon and the diamond, resisting any tidy moral. The final image of echoes responding, not repeating, reweights the entire premise without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a precise, articulate rhythm that mirrors the protagonist's nature. The perceptual signature is unique and consistent, filtering the world through a linguist's sensibility ("transient grammars," "syntax"). POV is stable and deeply immersive, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is masterful, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("light like trapped screams"). Rhythm is varied and propulsive, accelerating with the flock's arrival and slowing into the final, resonant beats. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cursed diamond, echo-canyon, and bird-syntax is profoundly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally devastating conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
