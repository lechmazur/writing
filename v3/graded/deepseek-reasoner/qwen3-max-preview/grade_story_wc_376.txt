<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, relentless, and rooted in consistent traits that compel high-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure (e.g., wilting near dishonesty). The final choice to become the archive is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language in the wilting description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost on the page (reversal of wilting, becoming the archive). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks. The map's discovery is slightly convenient but pays off in closure. Orientation is strong within the first 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, with sensory detail filtered through POV bias. The greenhouse city actively pressures choices and charges the final image (toxic sky, humid gloom). Environmental details like the moss-covered vents and ghost vines constrain tactics and reweight meaning. High specificity without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through environmental untruths and physical wilting. Cost is legible in her embodied struggle and recovery. The dominant stake (finding lost conversations) tightens meaningfully through discovered echoes. One minor deduction for a slight reliance on ambient pressure over active antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the archive metaphor. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., the unsent letters). Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent and character-specific, with diction matching the calligrapher's profession. Purposeful compression (e.g., "silence pooled like standing water") serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Figurative language is generally purposeful but occasionally dense in peak beats (e.g., "ligatures of longing, marginalia of memory" risks slight overload). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Minor deduction for two instances of near-redundant phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is highly original and transformed through specific, grounded choices. The synthesis of calligraphy, wilting trait, and lost conversations feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
