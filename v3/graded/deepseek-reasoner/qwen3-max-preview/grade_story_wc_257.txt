<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like tracing the locket's rim. The motivation ("to teach withering to bloom again") is dramatized through her sacred method of leaving offerings, not told. A final micro-choice—placing the locket in a crane—reveals a hierarchy of values with quiet cost, earning the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the completed locket left for a stranger reconfigures her purpose from private grief to communal offering. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through the pattern of folded paper and coordinates until the final act lands. The observatory's curtains stirring miles away is a masterful payoff that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The observatory is not just a setting but a vital crucible that constrains and enables her entire endeavor; its timeless, shuttered nature directly enables her method. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through her POV, like the "cold brass rim" and "weighted silk the color of twilight." The environment subtly mirrors her internal state and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in the decisive act of leaving the locket. The dominant stake (rerouting sorrow) tightens through the pattern of her offerings, and the cost is felt in her solitary labor and the faint smile of shared resonance. The final choice to release the locket forecloses a path of isolation, paid for with her own unfinished grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept that "the genuinely artificial became sacred," resisting moralizing. The final image of the locket's coordinates offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how grief transforms. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and objects, like the origami figures being "ephemera soaked in other people’s endings."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through a lens of grief and intention. The prose's lyrical, measured rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional intensity, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the recipient of the locket) is taught and pays off, trusting the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language ("time pooled here like spilled ink") is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, varying to accelerate with intention and breathe in reflective moments. The final line lands with profound resonance and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a grief-stricken artist leaving coordinate-laden origami as offerings—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept of "curtains of intention" responding to emotional resonance is a bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance, avoiding median options and generic templates.</comment>
