<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices ("gritted his teeth. This was not redemption. This was rebellion."). The final choice to lift the gear is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost of solitary burden, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from initiation to closure. The decisive change (retrieving the gear) occurs on-page with undeniable cost ("carried its weight alone"), and the persistent constraint of the hunger stone's dissolution shapes the final image. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse and hunger stone are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's professional perception ("dissecting the stone’s geometry"). The environment evolves causally with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling fate) is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency under the causal lens. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the stone and the protagonist's "bleak exhilaration." One meaningful tightening (slotting the mainspring) forces a trade-off with irreversible consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebellion against predestination emerges organically through events and images, notably the yoyo as a "message sent backward." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the paradox of the self-sent blueprint, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature ("latent radiance bloomed—not light, but presence"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, and purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanism of the yoyo) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats ("Paradox coiled around him like smoke"). No artifacts obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes time manipulation and mythos with originality, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric compression of the mechanism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific combination of elements (yoyo, hunger stone) is irreplaceable.</comment>
