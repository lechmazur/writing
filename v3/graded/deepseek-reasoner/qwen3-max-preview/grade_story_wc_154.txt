<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, rooted in her profession and trauma, and intensifies under the anesthetic's pressure. Her internal conflict is concrete and embodied, shown through tactile interactions with the coral and cast. The final choice to bear witness rather than heal is earned by her translator's skills and empathy, with the cost of enduring kinship legible in the final lines. A single minor deduction for a slightly elevated phrase ("lotus-hearted ache") that borders on diagnostic label-speak in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; pressure builds through sensory density and pattern recognition (decrypting the cast) leading to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The final image of the transformed cast and Mira's lighter step is a decisive change in understanding, with cost felt in the acceptance of "kinship" over grief. Orientation is immediate and functional, teaching the liminal space pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as a potent micro-setting, its glass ceiling and condensation refracting light and shaping the dreamlike pressure. The brain coral fragment is a recurring object that charges the final image, its warmth and resonance directly enabling the climax. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into Mira's perception under the drug's influence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Mira's active decryption of the cast, a meaningful tightening that deepens the stakes from personal memory to shared witness. The cost is the acceptance of permanent "ache" as "kinship," made legible on the page. Agency is clear in her choice to press the coral to the cast and speak the phrases, foreclosing the path of erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in witness, not erasure, emerges organically from the core action of decrypting the child's trauma. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed cast and the concept of "symbiosis." Subtext is powerful in the child's scribbled phrases and the coral's resonance, avoiding any direct thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's translator's mind, with a distinct perceptual signature ("ceasefire whispers," "coded grief"). The prose rhythm modulates expertly with the drug's weight and the decryption's focus. The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with no head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the peak beat ("lotus-hearted ache"), but it is pattern-taught by the earlier lyrical style and does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; every sentence advances atmosphere and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conflict-zone translator's skills with an anesthetic-induced vision is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "shared anxieties" is transformed through specific, grounded particulars—the coral, the cast, the act of decryption. The emotional specificity and refusal of a tidy resolution demonstrate authentic, risk-taking vision.</comment>
