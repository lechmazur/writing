<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The janitor's motivation is a profound, consistent force that drives every on-page choice, from his empathetic tracing of the comet to his final benedictory sweeping. His internal contradiction—finding strength in celestial surrender—is dramatized, not summarized, particularly in the beat where he closes his eyes to feel a star's dissolution. His renunciation of the Grand Celestial Archive is an Earned Stasis with visible cost, foreclosing a path of cold cataloging for one of sacred witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the janitor witnesses the comet's efflorescence, reconfiguring his understanding of "flourishing stillness" with a visible, felt cost (his caught breath and tears). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, escalating through a cadence shift from observed embers to the unannounced visitor, culminating in the silent bloom that the sensors cannot register but he feels as the universe exhaling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass is the quintessential micro-setting that constrains choice (he uses it to trace the comet's arc) and decisively charges the final image as it glows on the console, a beacon for reverence. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through the janitor's professional and spiritual priorities, from the "whispering" broom to the "velvet dark" against which he sees "golden threads."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: the shift from logged, descending comets to the "rogue comet, unlogged, unannounced." The janitor's agency—kneeling and tracing its arc "to understand its intent"—directly leads to the climax where the stake (witnessing sacred release) is profoundly reweighted. The cost is the silent, unrecorded peace he alone recognizes, a price paid in the vulnerability of his tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>The theme of finding strength in vulnerability emerges organically from the janitor's specific actions and the comet's final, offering act, resisting any direct statement. The core concept, "flourishing stillness," is the story's engine, transforming from a recalled journal entry into a lived, witnessed reality in the comet's efflorescence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the image of the janitor sweeping, each stroke a benediction, perfectly integrating theme and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is a singular, stunning achievement—a distinct perceptual signature that blends the cosmic and the intimately human with flawless control. The prose's rhythmic, poetic cadence is entirely voice-motivated and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity, as in: "Tonight, the sky wept embers." POV distance is perfectly controlled, staying strictly bound to the janitor's consciousness, with his spiritual curiosity filtering every perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is consistently sharp and purposeful ("the sky wept embers," "gravitational sigh"), with no mixed metaphors or decorative clutter. Rhythm is masterfully varied, modulating from the long, breathing sentences of deep space to the shorter, reverential clauses of the climax, creating immense propulsion toward the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes a well-worn archetype (the isolated watcher) with a profoundly fresh, non-obvious angle: not prediction or glory, but empathetic reverence for celestial death. The core concept of "flourishing stillness" is a genuine risk that pays off entirely at closure, transforming a quiet ending into a moment of immense conceptual and emotional weight. The specific, lived-in details—the patched tunic, the analog dials—ground the high concept in a tangible, authentic vision.</comment>
