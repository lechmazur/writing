<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotions ("fingers brush a crumbling archway...feels the ghost of laughter"). A meaningful change—uncloaking and planting seeds—is earned by prior causality of noticing loss. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the sound of dripping water reconfiguring meaning, holding under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image of seeds pressed into "reluctant earth." The single-scene structure is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are not merely described; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV's bias, with the environment subtly guiding her actions and mirroring her internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to offering to the decisive act of uncloaking and guerrilla gardening. The cost—the refusal to let beauty be erased—is legible on the page, though the stakes are more internal than external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding the sacred in decay emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the seed and the dripping water, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently lyrical and reflective, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the bakery's closure) is taught and pays off, enriching the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduct for occasional over-written phrases ("the grammar of absolution") that slightly elevate diction beyond the POV's likely lexicon in peak beats, creating a minor register drift without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of a "creeping normality noticer" and "guerrilla gardening" in a decaying palace offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The core concept feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
