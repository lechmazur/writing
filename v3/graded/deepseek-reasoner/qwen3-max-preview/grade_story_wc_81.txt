<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "tranquilly perceptive" attribute is embodied through active stillness and micro-choices like using a bone stylus, though emotional range remains somewhat narrow under pressure. Final choice to verify and surface feels earned by prior causality, with cost legible in the weight of testimony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the archivist's message and protagonist's verification carrying undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and pattern of discovery through environmental clues is taut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (sealed vents, fused ledger) and charging the final image (preserved Master Index). Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through professional bias, with spatial choreography coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist's agency under accumulative lens; "alternative hypothesis" method actively narrows options. Cost is legible in the muted revelation of elite stockpiles and the final, weighty solidarity with the silenced archivists.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed testimony emerges organically from particulars (grain shipments, bricked stairwells) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the Master Index's message and the protagonist's inscribed verification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; prose rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor register drift in phrases like "dappled with resolve" feels slightly elevated but does not obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("dappled—not unbroken, but patterned with clarity") causes a slight figurative muddle but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken library and forensic archeology tropes through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
