<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: panic "subsumed by training" into calm observation, emotions becoming data points. Final renunciation of rescue is earned by her life's work, though "warmth spreading" slightly over-tells emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: homing beacon's activation doesn't resolve conflict but crystallizes her epiphany that rescue is irrelevant to her purpose. Cost is visceral through "air grew colder... warmth spreading" and "not fallen; gathered up."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: brass telescope anchors panic, becomes warm lap-object at closure; gondola window transforms from barrier to ledger interface where her hand meets "full of memory" emptiness. Environment actively constrains and charges every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake "proving empty spaces remember" tightens through her shift from "trying to be found" to memorializing. Homing beacon complicates but doesn't resolve—cost is her life made legible via "warmth spreading" as rescue becomes statistically irrelevant to her closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: cloud taxonomy, spooled data, final "Remembered." Avoids moralizing; "atmosphere was a ledger" metaphor stays character-rooted. Final image reweights "emptiness" without abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: clouds as "roiling frustration" or "blanket of quiet satisfaction" filter weather through her emotional science. Syntax breathes with pressure—panic shortens phrases, calm expands them. Zero head-hopping; beacon's "beep" filtered through detachment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silence... quietly explosive" shows textural density without muddle. Only hairline slip: "dusty starlight" repetition risks near-synonym churn, but final image's resonance (filtering through "serene acceptance") redeems it as intentional motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms meteorology tropes: emotional cloud taxonomy isn't whimsy but her scientific method with life-or-death stakes. Risk-taking in structure (no survival plot) heightens meaning; "sky as ledger" concept feels inevitable yet fresh through concrete observation.</comment>
