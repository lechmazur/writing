<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hideo's motivation to appreciate hidden effort is embodied through micro-choices like stirring air instead of water during confrontation. Contradictory impulses (demure humility vs. audacious insight) drive his closure choice without diagnostic labels. Headman's pressure crystallizes stakes but lacks sufficient interior contradiction beyond pragmatic dismissal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: headman's "pragmatic complaints forgotten" after witnessing the firefly net. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern escalation—Hideo's silent stir reconfigures the dominant stake. Cost proof solid in the dissolution moment where effort outweighs tangible results.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parapet's wet stone and bamboo whisk constrain choices (stirring air vs. water) and charge closure via the glowing net dissolving into "playful chaos." Sensory hierarchy reflects Hideo's net-mender focus—moss, droplets, tine whispers—avoiding white-room syndrome while mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when headman's demand for "real nets" collides with Hideo's silent demonstration. Escalation driven by protagonist agency (choosing not to whistle) reweights appreciation as valid labor under Accumulative lens. Cost legible as headman's worldview fractures—"breath stolen" by the ephemeral net.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fireflies as "living net" metaphor without moralizing. Final image—"endless, hidden effort of a world tirelessly weaving itself whole"—reweights prior material as resonant answer to "appreciating mending." Avoids thematic echo despite Hideo's internal phrasing bordering on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV voice distinct through Hideo's net-mender lexicon ("broken threads," "potential connections"). Perceptual signature sharpens under pressure: headman's voice "cutting through" contrasts with firefly "whisper." Minor register drift in "scintillatingly somber" but sustained rhythmic control elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere or stakes ("tines whispering against ceramic in a rhythm only he understood"). Figurative language sparse yet potent—"wheel of connection spun from nothing." Final line’s "beautiful, mending net of the night" crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of net-mending philosophy with firefly patterns avoids trope. Risk-taking in silent climax (no whistle) heightens stakes coherently. Emotional specificity in "demure audacity" elevates beyond generic wisdom tales while maintaining conceptual integrity through tactile details.</comment>
