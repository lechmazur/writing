<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via drawer-pull ritual and embodied tension during the stumble/spit crisis; commanders' abrupt shift lacks micro-choice nuance despite strong setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—the commander's weapon release and handed-back pull crystallize stakes with felt cost; Accumulative lens holds through moon/drawer-pull weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Parapet’s mist thickness dictates timing, wet stones cause stumbling, and the drawer pull (micro-setting) actively constrains the commander’s choice; final "cool weight" charges closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mist into swirling ghosts," "pearlescent glow") modulates perfectly under stress; only minor risk in "thoughtful expression carved" edging toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sliver of waxing crescent" and "toxic energy neutralized" exemplify high-density propulsion; minor abstraction in "carved features" redeemed by immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner-exchange trope via drawer pull’s domestic symbolism and moon-phase ritual; "not forgiveness, not yet" delivers fresh emotional specificity without safety-hedging.</comment>
