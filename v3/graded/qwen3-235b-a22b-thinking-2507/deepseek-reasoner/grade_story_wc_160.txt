<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. care for mountain) act simultaneously in crisis; final choice earned through micro-choices like analyzing adhesive residue. Slight over-reliance on "dappled resolve" abstraction without deeper physiological embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("weight of her decision settling upon her") under causal lens. Pressure tightens via because/therefore linkage from tremor to rerouting; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcano amphitheater constrains choice (secondary fault line) and charges final image ("mountain breathed easily"). Antique chain functions as micro-setting, shifting from listening tool to pressure-mapping device with tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency under causal lens: sabotage discovery forces third-path calculus. Moral stakes sharpen peak choice, but "fractured resolve" phrasing slightly softens the visceral cost of rejecting Kael's path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (controlled sigh vs. destructive release), not moralizing. Final line reweights "encrypted compassion" without stating moral, though "true harmony" risks borderline abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("professional tenderness," geothermal lexicon) modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in crisis ("fingers flew across the console"), but "dappled resolve" slightly dilutes voice specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("frantic, staccato rhythm" shows vibration). Final image ("mountain breathed easily... so did she") recharges motif without muddle. Minor overwriting in "sigh and contract, a deep, resonant rhythm" slightly slows tempo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" transforms sabotage trope through adhesive residue/eyelash evidence. Emotional specificity in third-path solution feels inevitable, avoiding middle-ground hedging while heightening stakes via concrete geology.</comment>
