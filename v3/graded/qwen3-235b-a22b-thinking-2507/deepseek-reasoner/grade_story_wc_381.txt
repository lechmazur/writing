<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied silence ("weary to his bones") avoids diagnostic labels; contradictory impulses (enduring visions vs. cultivating hush) drive the Earned Stasis closure with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options through the wing's ascent, with visible cost in exhaustion and the prophecy's unraveling; Accumulative lens holds via density increase in the "tranquil blaze" beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The origami wing (tool) constrains choice by requiring mapped silence and charges the final image as a "white scar" against stars, reweighting the brook's hush into cosmic presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: prophecy's static intensifies pressure, narrowing options to endurance; cost legible in "woven silence wavering" and physical depletion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wing's transformation—"silence that dreamed" reweights ruin into safety without moralizing; avoids final-paragraph pitfalls by charging closure via the brook's healed hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cartographer of the void") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control sustains tension through lyrical compression ("smoothed hush" refrain) without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "terrestrially cosmic" description; otherwise pristine propulsion with zero loops—final image ("beautiful nothing") achieves high density without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and Zen practice via "mapping silence"; risk-taking heightens stakes (silence as weapon) while closure's wing ascent feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
