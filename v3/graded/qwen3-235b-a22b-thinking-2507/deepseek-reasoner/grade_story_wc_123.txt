<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when "integrity in solitude" clashes with sending evidence; embodied tension in fumbling fingers contrasts scientific precision. Follower thread lacks full integration into choices, slightly weakening causality for closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she would not run; she would record" crystallizes stance with visible cost amid sirens. Causal lens holds rigorously from pigeon arrival to data analysis. Only minor flaw: follower setup isn't fully paid off in tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Courtyard's "layered tranquility" evolves from sanctuary to pressure point; weather station tools constrain choices during analysis. Final image of pigeon vanishing into "silent, layered night" recharges setting with undeniable cost. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. systemic deception) tightens causally: message → data verification → solitary action. Cost is unmistakable in "integrity demanded action" amid sirens. No secondary stakes dilute focus; escalation driven purely by protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: stitched message ("Proof... Data follows") embodies earned integrity without moralizing. Final image reweights "tranquility" into charged silence, answering "nurture integrity" with resonant cost. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision ("particulate counts") blends with poetic tension ("humming with strange tension"). Under stress, syntax compresses ("She looked... and knew"). Filter verb "noticed" is voice-motivated and isolated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "slate-grey carrier pigeon" shows textural specificity. Every sentence advances plot: "thermal maps revealed... incineration" delivers dual character/world insight. Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through scientific lens: "lateral progression" method feels fresh for truth-seeking. Emotional specificity in solitary defiance avoids cliché. Pigeon-as-data-carrier bends tropes via character-specific tools.</comment>
