<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent; "cheerful gloom" embodies contradictory emotions effectively. Final choice (planting seedling) earned through micro-choices like placing seed on glass, but internal conflict lacks deeper exploration of flaws under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "gloomy weight of not-knowing lifted, replaced by cheerful clarity of truth." Accumulative lens holds throughout, though tern's seed arrival edges toward convenient complication without sufficient causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crater glass functions as essential micro-setting—constrains choices (emotional translation) and charges final image (cooling, seedling sprouting). Cave description vivid but ornamental; glass-seedling progression meets 9+ gate by shaping closure's emotional cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara's conjecture agency; glyphs' revelation narrows options from unknowing to bittersweet truth. Cost unmistakable in "joy of discovery and melancholy of its cost," reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens without resolution convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Final image of silver seedling offers resonant, non-literal answer: paths disappear due to complex truths requiring heart-translators. Theme emerges through ship memory reconstruction without moralizing; "understood sacrifice" avoids tidy binaries while embracing loss/beauty duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "watery hues" and "shimmering glyphs," but "profound, resolute acceptance" slightly abstracts emotion. Rhythmic control strong under pressure, though peak-beat phrasing risks genericity without deeper embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cheerful gloom" exemplifies high-density oxymoron. Final line ("ocean’s whispers were waiting") recharges motifs with propulsion. Figurative language consistently serves atmosphere without muddling closure’s emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-keeper archetype with scientific-poetic tools (crater glass transliteration). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes through emotional density, transforming "sorrow" into "understood sacrifice" with conceptual inevitability.</comment>
