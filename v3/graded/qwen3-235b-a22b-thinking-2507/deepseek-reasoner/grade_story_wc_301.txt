<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (clinical distance vs raw confession) act simultaneously; final choice to play accordion earned by prior causality with visible cost in "raw solace hardened into strength." No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("river does not blame water" reweights premise); accumulative lens holds through coordinate accumulation. Cost proof: "raw solace hardened into quiet, enduring strength" crystallizes irreversible shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station functions as micro-setting: lavatory graffiti directly constrains choices (cross-referencing coordinates), while accordion bellows charge final image. "Damp, echoing vault" grounds sensory urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (adding coordinates forces direct confession); cost legible when "raw solace hardened into strength" forecloses solitary path. Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through bathroom graffiti mechanics, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: map coordinates shift from pain markers to connection points. Final image reweights river metaphor without moralizing; "learning to sing its song" offers resonant answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: chronicler's precision ("51.48° N, 0.00° W") modulates into raw vulnerability. Rhythmic control under storm pressure: short clauses ("A sob escaped her") contrast with lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ragged as the breath of the accordion" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line recharges opening motif without muddle. "Tape with her finger, thinking of her own mended cracks" avoids synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "regret mapping" trope through specific lived detail (bathroom graffiti as registry of sanctuaries). Fresh inflection: self-forgiveness as communal confluence, not solitary destination. Avoids safety middle with bold structural synthesis.</comment>
