<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic vs. awe) act simultaneously; final shift to scribe earned by phrasebook's dog-ear. Flaw: Over-reliance on maps isn't tested until climax, slightly weakening causal chain for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "no longer editor but scribe" + ice groaning with "awakening" proves conceptual cost. Hairline slip: Obsidian ice transition lacks one intensifying sensory beat mid-escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Condensation pattern constrains choice (tracing it) and charges final image (mirroring drawings), meeting 9+ gate. Frost-ferned maps and phrasebook's dampness exemplify purposeful specificity; no white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation deepens knowledge (geographical source → absence) with legible cost: "solemn duty of witness" replaces academic motivation. Slight drag in middle as silence deepens without immediate tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights "source" non-literally: rivers "were continuing," not beginning. Avoids moralizing; subtext in ice-fisher's point and condensation mirroring. Near-slip: "cradle" phrase edges toward exposition but stays grounded in city imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fleeting bruise," "frost-ferned map" reflect atlas-editor POV. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (short sentences for tension, lyrical for revelation). Minor register drift: "visceral" feels clinical for her voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density: "world holding its breath" does triple duty. Final line recharges condensation motif. One near-cliché ("guttural dialects") redeemed by later specificity ("single guttural word"). No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "source" trope through absence; emotional truth in academic confronting awe. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes. Hairline slip: "ice-fishers" border on archetype, but wrinkles-as-roadmap saves specificity.</comment>
