<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("gentle radical") embodied in micro-choices: steel fingers hovering then placing tessera, kneeling twice with shifting purpose. Flawless status dynamics with lieutenant; emotional layering avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "fractures in the sky seemed less like wounds" reconfigures the dominant stake. Accumulative/Textural lens held perfectly; "warm coldness" tonal paradox pays off in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Tessera functions as micro-setting that constrains every key choice: triggers vision, becomes renaming tool, charges final image. "Soot-stained stones" and fractured sky pressure all actions without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (erasure vs preservation) tightens when lieutenant's command forces crystallization. Cost is visceral: steel arms "heavy with new purpose" as she defies orders; agency drives the naming act under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tessera's journey: "stubborn, deep blue" becomes "shield, story, testament." Final mosaic metaphor reweights destruction without moralizing; "aberrant mercy" shown via action, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "servos whirring softly," "weak sun offering no heat." No filter verbs in peak beats; lieutenant's clinical dialogue ("Designate Gamma-Seven") reveals character through lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "drowning in warmth of forgotten sun" compresses retrocognition without muddle. Only hairline flaw: "retrocognitively trapped" slightly strains lexicon but redeemed by immediate sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific synthesis: "Steel Cradles" unit name, tessera as both object/concept. Emotional truth in hesitation—not rejecting armor but redirecting its purpose.</comment>
