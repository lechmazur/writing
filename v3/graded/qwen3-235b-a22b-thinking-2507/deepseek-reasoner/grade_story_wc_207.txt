<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the refusal to fill a jar, earned by the visceral shift from collector to keeper. Embodied emotion ("water shockingly cold") avoids therapy-speak while layering awe and surrender during psychometry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands cleanly: "He did not fill a jar" crystallizes the cost of accepting the uncollectible. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, with the compass's hum reweighting the quest's meaning under palpable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lagoon's "mirror-still water" and compass constrain choice (wading chest-deep) and charge the final image ("resonant hush now living inside him"). Mineral dampness detail transforms setting from backdrop to active participant in the revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency: Silas's deliberate wade into the lagoon narrows options to acceptance versus capture. The cost—"He could not capture this"—is legible in the abandoned jar, reconfiguring his lifelong pursuit under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: the final image of carrying "the lagoon's quiet truth" reweights the quest without moralizing. "A moment of pure acceptance" resonates as earned wisdom from the compass's activation, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "primal, mineral dampness" and "hinged awakenings," with rhythm compressing under stress ("He closed his eyes... waiting"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly to the revelation's intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances atmosphere or stakes ("black, mirror-still body of water" conveys silence and depth). Final line’s "forever changed" avoids cliché through concrete anchoring in the factory whistle, with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of petrichor as metaphor for unanswerable wonder transforms the quest trope. The compass’s true purpose (pointing to acceptance) grows organically from setup, with risk-taking (quiet closure) heightening emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
