<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong but climax's "fear of being ordinary" diagnosis feels abstract, lacking embodied cost within 3 lines; micro-choices under pressure otherwise concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "labyrinth dissolved into clarity" reconfigures meaning with visible cost ("weight within her gone") under Accumulative lens; pattern break at pool scene crystallizes stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Viaduct and tablet function as micro-setting: narrow ledge constrains movement, tablet's warmth signals proximity to core, inert final state charges resolution; rain-moonlight motif evolves causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure (indigo tunnel, inverted gravity), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—procedural generation drives path choices rather than Elara's active decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (pool merger), not moralizing; final "ripple caught up to the drop" reweights opening metaphor non-literally, though diagnostic label-speak slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bare calloused feet," "crystallized anxiety") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's clarity shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("She moved, her body flowing with effortless grace that defied more than gravity"), though "crystallized anxiety" borders on stock metaphor without deepening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural generation with psychic labyrinth; gravity defiance transforms trope through specific causal pressure (narrow ledge, inverted gravity), avoiding abstract everywhere settings.</comment>
