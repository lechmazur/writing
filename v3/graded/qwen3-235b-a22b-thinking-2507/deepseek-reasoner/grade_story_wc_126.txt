<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's shift from fighting silence to playing *with* it; embodied frustration ("music was tiny") avoids therapy-speak. Grandfather's motivation slightly thin despite poignant "last leaves" metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the pear in the mendicant's bowl crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass constrains choices (entry fracture, swallowed notes) and charges closure via condensation pings. Bowl's evolution from empty vessel to holding pear fulfills micro-setting 9+ gate flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory escalation (shipwreck silence → absolute greenhouse quiet), resolved by Elara's agency in musical approach shift. Cost legible in the single pear's tangible fragility against vast silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("canvas, not a cage") offers resonant non-literal answer to "beauty in unfinished" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: condensation pings reweighting chronic hush as fertile ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("hollow hum," "knuckles brushed glass") masterfully filters world through acoustic lens. Minor POV slip in "She knew this was her story" slightly undermines focalization under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "black mirror reflecting bleached sky" exemplifies textural specificity. One abstraction ("frustration mounted") in high-pressure beat prevents higher score despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through acoustic specificity: "echo-harbor violinist" and condensation pings create fresh emotional logic. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
