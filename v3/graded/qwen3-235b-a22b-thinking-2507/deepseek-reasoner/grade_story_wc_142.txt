<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's dual allegiance is concretely embodied through micro-choices (graffiti encoding vs. official plans), but lacks a genuine flaw that compounds under pressure. Hem's trust transfer crystallizes stakes via the foundation stone. Near-perfect interiority avoids diagnostic labels yet competence borders on implausible resolve. Minor deduction for no inevitable mistake altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: mural's "Remember. Adapt. Persist." crystallizes Lyra's role with felt cost (stone's weight in pocket). Accumulative lens holds through density buildup (graffiti → community adaptation → defiant joy). Orientation anchored by para 1; cost proof irrefutable in final image. No causality breaks; escalation sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting that charges closure—depicted in mural with coded text, reweighting its meaning from luck charm to communal anchor. Sensory details selective ("creaking wood" sigh, spray paint stains) and urgency-appropriate. Raft-city specifics (murky canal, blinking lights) constrain movement and tactics. Elevates beyond vivid description by shaping Lyra's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lyra's agency: encoded graffiti enables community-led adaptation, narrowing options from anxious resistance to defiant joy. Dominant stake (preserving heart vs. corporate sanitization) signaled early and tightened through visible cost (Hem's stall relocation, trust burden). Cost unmistakable in "steady resolve" after stone transfer. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: graffiti as encoded resistance, stone as foundation. Ending offers non-literal answer—"reorganizing around its own heart"—without moralizing. "Remember. Adapt. Persist." shown via mural, not told. Avoids binaries; OmniCorp's threat contextualizes community resilience. Slight thematic echo in "hopeful desperation" mitigated by embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lyra notices textures (spray paint, creaking wood), not tourist sights. Rhythmic control under pressure—"music played, and the city... was still their own" accelerates closure. Dialogue indirection (Hem's sparse speech vs. Lyra's firm softness) reveals status dynamics. Elision (graffiti codes) taught early and paid off in mural. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "murky water between rafts" exemplifies textural specificity without overwriting. Every sentence advances momentum ("Her duty was to the city's founders... but her paycheck..."). Final line recharges opening anxiety with earned hope. No figurative muddle in peak beats; cost ("stone warm in her pocket") lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Culture Shock Absorber" trope transformed via raft-city specificity and graffiti method. Foundation stone reprise in mural feels inevitable, not symbolic convenience. Emotional truth in "hopeful desperation" avoiding generic templates. Risk-taking (encoding resistance in art) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis elevates familiar gentrification conflict.</comment>
