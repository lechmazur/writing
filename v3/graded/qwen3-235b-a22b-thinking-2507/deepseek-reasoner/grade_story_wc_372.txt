<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist's motivation ("to conjure meaning from oblivion") drives every action with embodied cost ("heart a heavy weight"); contradictory impulses (meticulous cataloger vs. truth seeker) crystallize in his paradigm shift when handling the luminous vows slide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: his realization ("measuring the echo, not the voice") reconfigures options with visible cost (abandoning decay-focused methodology), under Accumulative/Textural lens where slide samples accumulate pressure toward crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen library functions as micro-setting—the frost-veined floor's "soft crunch" constrains movement, while the quartz hush and lantern apparatus directly charge the final image of building a "new constellation" from enduring light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving meaning against entropy) tightens through resonant slide samples; agency manifests in his methodological shift, with cost legible in the paradigm collapse ("his heart a heavy weight") and abandonment of prior purpose under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: fading slides versus luminous vows reweight "meaning from oblivion" without moralizing; the final constellation image offers non-literal resolution to the central question through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruise healing into yellow," "quartz hush") modulates rhythm under pressure; syntactic control shifts from measured cadence during sampling to crystalline clarity at the vows' revelation, with no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "bruise healing into yellow" slightly strains metaphor (bruises fade *to* yellow, not "healing into"); minor filter verb in "he understood" prevents 9.0, though closure remains sharp and unobscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms archive trope through specific, grounded choices (magic lantern slides, quartz hush); luminous vows feel inevitable in hindsight as the only logical resolution to entropy stakes, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
