<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "thoughtful nature" vs ignited motivation; embodied emotion through chisel/ribbon; micro-choice to follow spectral nudge shows hierarchy of values. Final scribe realization earns closure without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: withdrawal of guide creates visible cost ("profound peace" replacing spectral presence), with lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through final image of ribbon as scribe's tool. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ribbon) charges closure: evolves from forgotten object to "stanza in visual poem," constraining her understanding of grief. Greenhouse humidity/butterflies mirror internal state without overt symbolism. Final image hinges on tangible object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shaping collective grief) tightens via ribbon's guidance to conservatory, with cost in spectral guide's withdrawal. Agency-driven escalation; butterfly migration timeframe pressures her witnessing but doesn't actively tighten tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: ribbon flowers as poem stanzas, carved stones as "space for a poem." Avoids moralizing; final image reweights grief as dialogue without stating thesis. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: carver's tactile focus ("chisel whispered," "fingers traced threads"). Rhythmic control intensifies in conservatory ("fiercely meditative" prose mirrors concentration). Zero POV slippage; lyric compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thundering calm" repetition functions as intentional motif. High density: "vibrant, decaying greenery" compresses setting/emotion. Final line's "permanent as stone/light as butterfly wing" avoids cliché through precise duality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: gravestone carver + spectral guide + ribbon as poem-map. Emotional truth in "grief as dialogue" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry; closure feels inevitable.</comment>
