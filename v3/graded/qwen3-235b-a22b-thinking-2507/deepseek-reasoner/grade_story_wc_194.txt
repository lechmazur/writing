<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("dynasty ender" vs. seeking truth) manifests in embodied micro-choices (plucking wire despite risk) without diagnostic labels; closure choice (accepting liberation) earns cost via prior causality in ledger musing and wire discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("weight... evaporated") under Accumulative lens; wire vibration → handle manifestation → grandfather's voice forms a single resonant intensification where sensory density reweights stakes, though "standing waves" explanation slightly over-engineers causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (wire/map) constrains choice (plucking triggers handle appearance) and charges final image ("leaving shadows behind"); golden shadows evolve from camouflage to emotional metaphor with precise sensory economy ("pooled like liquid amber" → "shadows now just shadows").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (shame of dynasty's end) tighten through protagonist's agency (plucking wire), narrowing options to acceptance with visible cost ("shame... evaporated"), but escalation relies slightly on coincidence (wire's vibration revealing handle) rather than pure pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting of "map" (places → choices) and "bridge" (physical → intuitive); final image ("not an end, but a conclusion") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite grandfather's explicit "map was not of places."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines in selective detail ("brass horn muted," "dust" on wire); rhythmic control under pressure ("pure, resonant tone... vibrated through her very bones") avoids syntactic monotony, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's "golden shadows" resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crack... hair-thin wire suspended between two points") with propulsion through strong verbs ("stretched," "pooled," "hummed"); final line recharges opening motif without muddle, though "fundamental frequency" slightly risks register drift in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "dynasty end" trope through specific mechanics (wire vibration → standing waves) and emotional truth; risk-taking (Accumulative structure over causal) heightens stakes coherently, with "crank handle as key" synthesizing setting and theme inevitably in hindsight.</comment>
