<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("witness without judgment") but lacks contradictory impulses during crisis; Keeper acts flawlessly without internal tension. Micro-choices limited to origami handling, missing hierarchy-of-values shift under pressure. Final endurance feels unearned as prior stakes don't test his flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "settled back into great leafy stillness" crystallizes cost of absorbed trauma with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds throughout—sensory density escalates collapse until the knot's unraveling. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no causality breaks in the reality-fold journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and origami swan constrain choices (retreat enables journey; swan maps layers) and charge the final image (folding new swan amid calm river). "Stone wept dust" and "books bloomed with fungi" filter decay through Keeper's perception, avoiding generic symbolism. Final "leafy stillness" reweights setting with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve witnessing duty) tightens via sensory escalation: "tectonic groan" to "violent collapse" to foundational fracture. Keeper's agency drives escalation—burrowing through reality layers—yet cost (absorbing library's pain) lacks visible tactical consequence. Pressure narrows options effectively under Accumulative lens but cost doesn't alter post-crisis behavior.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "regenerative silence" as active healing, not abstraction. Final image reweights "crumbling peace" into "beautiful decline," offering non-literal answer: change *is* eternal life. Avoids moralizing; trauma integration shows complexity without false balance. "Guardian of quiet truth" crystallizes concept without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("knowledge dissolved into mud," "river churning black water") modulates with pressure—crisis narrows to vibration-frequency details. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during reality-fold journey. Rhythmic control peaks in climax: short clauses for fracture ("He moved through it, a witness to agony") then flowing closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cryptic folds" and "frayed edges of world" avoid mixed metaphors. Final beat’s propulsion ("He took out a new sheet... began to fold") charges closure without overwriting. One borderline cliché ("stone wept dust") but serves textural cohesion. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly with scene needs—dense collapse, sparse unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "regenerative silence" as potent stillness (not absence) transforms archivist trope. Emotional specificity in Keeper’s non-interference—witnessing trauma without judgment—avoids safety-hedging. Risk-taking (reality-layer journey via origami) heightens stakes coherently, though catacombs setting leans slightly generic despite vivid details.</comment>
