<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs. safety in lies) drive the climax; Mrs. Gable's vanishing act embodies earned cost through embodied action ("nicks and grooves felt like a map"), avoiding label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the whispering city reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (burden of memory), but meteor coincidence slightly undermines Accumulative pressure escalation at the turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rooftop garden and seal constrain choices (soil test, stone activation); the "worn stone and settling timber" opening image charges the final whispering city, fulfilling the 9+ gate via micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency (breaking the silence), narrowing options to truth or safety; cost is visceral in Mrs. Gable's disappearance, though meteor shower edges toward coincidental complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "language of old buildings" resolves into the city's whispering burden without moralizing; final image reweights blood memory as irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("guttural verbs and soft sibilants") with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and compression (Mrs. Gable's vanishing) taught early via "ghost herself" foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "velvety night" risks purple prose but "nicks and grooves felt like a map" delivers high-density tactile specificity; closure beat ("every cornice... whispered") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "dead language" trope through bone seal mechanics; specificity ("yellowed bone," "foundation bones") creates freshness, though "velvety night" slightly echoes cliché.</comment>
