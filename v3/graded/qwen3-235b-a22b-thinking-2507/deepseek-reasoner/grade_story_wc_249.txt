<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in quiet rebellion vs data-point status; "auroral sorrow" embodied through physical chill and drumming micro-choices. Final endurance earns cost via transformed sorrow, though "deep placid auroral sorrow" borders abstraction without deeper somatic anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density escalates to manifestation with felt cost in dissolution. Closure as Charged Poise ("sorrow light as starlight") crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choice (water vibrations guiding drumming) and charges final image ("proof of life"). Micro-setting excellence, though "liquid mirror alive with shimmering currents" risks purple prose without sufficient tactile constraint earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving connection real) tightens through drumming escalation. Agency-driven manifestation then dissolution creates irreversible cost: sorrow transformed but not resolved. Moral calculus between memory's beauty and ache sharpens the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through drumming-as-language and lagoon's response; final image reweights sorrow as "proof of life" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete cost (dissolution), though "ghostly second set of experiences" slightly abstracts entanglement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: frequencies "only she could decipher" filter all description. Rhythmic control mirrors drumming intensity ("soft rhythmic patter... skimming beat"). Minor register drift in "placid auroral sorrow" but compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("vibrated, singing a silent note") propels momentum. Final line's "light as starlight on water" avoids cliché through prior lagoon motifs. "Auroral sorrow" repetition slightly dulls closure's emotional precision despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory entanglement via sensory drumming language; transforms "ghost" trope through embodied cost. Emotional specificity in "foreign nostalgia for a place she'd never been" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
