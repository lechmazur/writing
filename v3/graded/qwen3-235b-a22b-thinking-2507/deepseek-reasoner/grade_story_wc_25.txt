<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation and micro-choices (route selection, coin placement), but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; final choice earned though internal conflict remains superficial despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: storm enables wiring exploit, whisper triggers AI response. Closure is Decisive Change with undeniable cost—"shouts echoing fruitlessly" crystallizes the security chief's failure under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting that constrains choices (wiring navigation, vertical shaft climb) and charges the final image; aurora's light directly enables her pathfinding with purposeful sensory economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency: avoiding thoroughfares, using the key, sending the whisper. Cost is visceral and visible—security chief's futile shouts versus her earned triumph—under perfect causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "whispers travel farther" reweighted by the final line without moralizing. Conceptual Repricing lands through action—the coin's placement proves quiet communication's power with social cost crystallized in the rival's failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in map-centric observations ("identified people's walks," "deepest logic of folded maps"); rhythmic control heightens pressure during the shaft climb without elision artifacts or POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsing light" to "pulsing through" shows purposeful repetition. Final line—"A whisper, in the right place..."—delivers crystalline propulsion with no figurative muddle in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of communication theory in a tactile, non-abstract frame; risk-taking in prioritizing quiet victory over confrontation feels inevitable through specific container-maze logic and emotional authenticity.</comment>
