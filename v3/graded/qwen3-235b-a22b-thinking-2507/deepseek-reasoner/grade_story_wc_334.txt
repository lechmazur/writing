<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in methodical analysis versus emotional need, but the trauma-to-peace shift feels slightly accelerated for full 9.0; micro-choices like repeated dives reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands unmistakably with "the past was finally whole," the trauma’s cost explicit in "buried the truth" and resolved through causal linkage; lens holds with zero ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipwrecks actively occlude stars to fracture the mushroom ring, constraining the celestial decoding method; the calm sea final image charges closure by contrasting storm memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through one decisive deepening: the misaligned mushroom pattern forces celestial decoding, with trauma’s conceptual cost legible in "buried the truth" and paid in settled peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—mushrooms as celestial map—not abstraction; final image reweights "gaping hole" without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality via spore-placement specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct folklorist perceptual signature ("cathedral of greenish light," "fungal formation sparking a connection") modulates under pressure; minor deduction for "chronic curiosity" label preceding embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("mossy floor, pale caps glowing faintly") advances plot and atmosphere; "technicolor scene" slightly clichéd but redeemed by precise storm-memory details.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklorist methodology with astronomy avoids tropes; emotional specificity in trauma burying truth feels earned, though the mushroom-ring mechanism edges toward conceptual neatness.</comment>
