<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between claustrophobia and mission commitment manifests physically ("panic clawing at her throat"), but motivation lacks active conflict in choices; "to stand by the unremembered" remains aspirational rather than driving concrete trade-offs during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (scientists left behind), but tidal change timing feels coincidental rather than causally earned; lens is Causal yet the "Emergency Protocol" resolution strains agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abyssal pressure and submersible’s "crashing hush" constrain every choice—claustrophobia intensifies in the breached dome, the Codex’s gold fleck pulses under pressure, and the final image of "churning water" charges the cost; environment is the silent antagonist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as the tidal change collapses her exit, but the "Emergency Return Protocol" feels like a late solution it didn’t create; cost is visceral (trapped scientists), yet the phase transition method lacks prior groundwork in escalation beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the silenced resonates through the Codex’s gold fleck (reactive calibrator) and Elara’s final vow, but "to stand by the unremembered" risks thematic echo; earns complexity by leaving ethical cost implicit in the "churning water" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Elara’s spelunker lens filters silt-coated desks as "frozen tableau," and stress compresses syntax ("breath hitching as walls closed in"); no head-hopping, with rhythmic control that modulates from thrumming silence to violent transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crushing, liquid weight" and "violent, silent scream" achieve textural specificity without muddle, though "pale, ghostly anemones" slightly drifts toward generic; propulsion never falters even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms undersea horror tropes via the Codex’s quantum-calibrator fleck and phase-transition escape; risks unconventional physics but grounds it in tactile detail (gold flecks "blazing," "impossible cold"), avoiding gimmickry through earned emotional stakes.</comment>
