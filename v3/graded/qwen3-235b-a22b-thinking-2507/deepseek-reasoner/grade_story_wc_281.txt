<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("affectionate skeptic" shown through pill dismissal then surrender), but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; "willowglass hope" cost feels abstract rather than scaled to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure valid RR (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost ("fragile... weight of the past"), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—pill effect happens *to* her, not from choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Studio constrains choice (wiring geode with pinpoint LED) and charges closure via "gossamer web of light" final image; micro-setting qualification perfectly executed for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative block vs illuminating connections) deepens meaningfully, but pressure doesn’t grow from protagonist agency; stakes remain abstract despite "fractally precise" motif.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through geode/light-web metaphor without moralizing; final image reweights "hidden truths" premise with conceptual cost, though father’s dialogue borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("latent energy of photographs"), but minor register drift ("somatic pull") clashes with artist POV during high-pressure memory sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with strong verbs ("ignited," "blossomed"), but "willowglass hope" borders on overwrought metaphor; minor scaffold in memory description ("felt rough wool... heard voice").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neurology/art via geode-as-neural-network; "willowglass hope" risks gimmickry but earns emotional specificity through closure image’s fragility/strength tension.</comment>
