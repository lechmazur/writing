<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (stern logician vs secret sentimentality), embodied cost in tears, and final choice earned through prior causality. Slight tell in "despairing" slightly undercuts peak-pressure embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: shattered composure and empty palm crystallize the conceptual shift. Lens (Accumulative) holds perfectly through starling observation to vapor release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Waterfall mists and orchard's "primordial potential" actively constrain choices (crystal weeps light only here); final glowing fruit charges closure. Environment isn't backdrop but causal agent in transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when logic fails ("tried everything... failed"), forcing intuitive observation. Escalation driven by agency (looking up, precise flame), with visceral cost in tears and the crystal's dissolution foreclosing her old method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through crystal/starlings duality; final glowing fruit offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids binaries by showing harmony as acknowledgment, not victory of one force over another.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist notices "hexagonal lattice," "primordial potential"); rhythmic control shifts from clinical to lyrical under pressure. Slight register drift in "last desperate hope" prevents 9.1.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "weep, not with water, but with light" exemplifies crystalline precision. Final line variation ("experiment over"/"understanding begun") avoids drumbeat rhythm while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logic/intuition through alchemy lens avoids trope; emotional truth in "secretly sentimental" scientist transforms familiar premise. Bold risk in making wonder tangible without gimmickry.</comment>
