<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "isolation into independence" vs. loneliness cage, but "resilient understanding" risks abstraction; micro-choices like tracing glyphs reveal values with tangible cost in the final hand placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: "independence slipping into loneliness" crystallizes into vessel activation; causal lens holds perfectly with tidal rhythm enabling light focus that unlocks the sundial's true purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atomically reflective walls actively constrain the climax—channeling light to ignite the sundial—while tidal propulsion redefines the library from tomb to vessel, charging the final image with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from isolation as "shield" to "cage," narrowing Lyra's options to endurance or launch; cost is visceral in her "brittle awakening" fragility confronting the sundial's truth, driving her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete vessel imagery: knowledge as "seed" not tomb, avoiding moralizing; final library turn reweights "coexist with ghosts" into action without stating the insight, though "resilient understanding" slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scales of tarnished moonlight," stone "hummed a vibrational chord") modulates from melancholy to wonder; rhythmic control peaks in the light-channeling climax with no head-hopping or POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "isolation... slipping away into sheer loneliness" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise high density with "photon of light" and "liquid river of sun" advancing plot, but no closure-tainting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-vessel avoids derivative tropes through tidal mechanics and sound-activated navigation; emotional specificity in Lyra's "shattered mosaic" past makes the voyage feel inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
