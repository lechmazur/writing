<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lyra’s "jolt of vulnerability" versus her "protected space held firm," with embodied micro-choices like cupping moss as invitation. Slight abstraction in "graft new meaning" prevents 9.0 despite strong flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the evolving drip pattern crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("letting it thaw, drip by drip"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; cost proof undeniable in final image reconfiguring trauma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Abandoned data center actively constrains choices (server racks as moss substrate) and charges closure through water patterns. Micro-setting (amber pendant) reweights meaning at payoff. Only "honeyed hush" repetition prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from Lyra’s isolation to shared vulnerability, with Leo’s arrival forcing stance crystallization. Cost is felt (silencing phone = rejecting digital world), but viral confession lacks visceral immediacy early on.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through moss/water motifs: "grafting new meaning" reweights wounds as evolving patterns without moralizing. Final image answers "how to heal" non-literally, though "map she was making" slightly overstates the concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber trapped prehistoric heart," "honeyed hush") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in closure beat ("never the same twice"). One filter verb ("Lyra felt") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; metaphors ("skeletal server racks") charge momentum. Final line "pooled at their feet" recharges water motif with perfect density. "Honeyed hush" repetition is intentional lyricism, not scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms trauma recovery through specific moss/data center fusion. Emotional truth in "protected vulnerability" avoids cliché; risk-taking in quiet closure feels inevitable. Near-echo of "thawing" motif elevates without derivative.</comment>
