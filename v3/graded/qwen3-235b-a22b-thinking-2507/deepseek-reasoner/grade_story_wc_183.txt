<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "woman split" and embodied exile of emerald card as self-reflection; micro-choice of clutching/reaching reveals hierarchy of values. Diagnostic "chimera twin discoverer" label risks therapy-speak but avoids penalty through concrete cost in final integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("aberrant bliss now integrated"); Accumulative lens holds through narrative-thread escalation to "thread of light" reconfiguration. Early orientation anchors ship/memory disorientation as functional pattern teaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ship-as-mind setting constrains all choices (carnival = fractured childhood); fog-cloaked bay evolves into room reveal charges final image. Salt-rotted wood/skeletal carnival details filtered through urgency avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through logbook discovery to bow confrontation under Accumulative lens; "cargo of identities" deepens knowledge with felt cost in self-recapture realization. Single escalation suffices for length with conceptual price paid in acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ship/card motifs reweighted at closure ("garden was found; its forgotten name was her own"); avoids moralizing by making integration the non-literal answer. Epiphany earned through logbook clues and physical card handling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "boots scraping salt-rotted wood" and "memories alter like fog"; rhythmic control in cadence shifts from decayed grandeur to quiet weaving. No POV slippage despite metaphysical revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed emerald sward card" shows textural specificity. Mild register drift in "blissfully aberrant" avoids penalty through thematic integration, but "unkindled solace" borders on overwriting in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "twin" trope through specific psychological lens; ship-as-mind synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in metaphysical closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional truth in "quiet weaving back together" resolution.</comment>
