<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied "cautious enchantment" avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (fear/thrill) manifest in micro-choices like respectful excavation. Final realization earned through physical scrolls, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "interrupted journey of her return was now complete" crystallizes generational fragmentation. Accumulative lens holds—density of meaning (sundial, scrolls) reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sundial base constrains choice (must move it to enter tomb) and charges closure as "shadow... like a bridge." Catacomb orchard’s roots supply gnomon branch; scent of orange trees evolves from "cautious enchantment" to earned peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: rebuilding gnomon transforms inert sundial into tool, narrowing options to excavation. Cost is legible in "monument to days that would never be counted"—generational interruption made visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "interrupted journeys" reweighted by sundial repair; no moralizing. Final image ("cautious enchantment made whole") answers central question via concrete shadow-as-bridge, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "faded map," "quietly desperate heart." Rhythmic control falters slightly in "vibrated in her bones" cliché, but compression (excavation days) taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "cautious enchantment" appears twice without pressure shift. Otherwise high density—sundial’s "sharp, definitive shadow" does triple duty (image, plot, theme). Closure beat immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope through specific artifacts (olive-branch gnomon, farmer/poet scrolls). Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off; "faith in story" premise avoids generic self-discovery via concrete genealogy.</comment>
