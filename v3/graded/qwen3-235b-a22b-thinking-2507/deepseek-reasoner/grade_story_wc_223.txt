<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s historian motivation is embodied in her pawn-touching and walking; Kael’s “benevolently ruthless” trait manifests concretely in the pawn return. Minor abstraction in “luminous absence” slightly dilutes emotional specificity at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the final image (“luminous absence began to fill... with meaning”) reweights the interregnum’s cost through the pawn’s placement. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds with density increase tightening the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Whispering gallery functions as active micro-setting—her footsteps as language constrain choice, and the chessboard’s evolution (void to restored potential) charges the closure. Sensory details (“cold marble,” “ghost of a piece”) reflect her historian’s bias without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Kael’s warning (“They want to unbind you”), but deepening relies on his agency rather than Elara’s choices. Cost is legible (“silence your feet”), yet protagonist-driven escalation lacks one tightening beat under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pawn restoration: history as small gestures gains resonance when Elara places the piece, offering a non-literal answer to erasure. Avoids moralizing; “luminous absence” transforms from description to active meaning without thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (“self-appointed historian of small gestures”), with rhythm modulating from measured to urgent. Kael’s “nomadic penumbra” line risks academic register, but voice remains anchored in Elara’s historian lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density (“ghost of a piece, the memory of a game”). Final line’s cadence (“wrote the first entry... finally include them all”) propels closure. Slight register drift in “benevolently ruthless” prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of political interregnum and archival intimacy; pawn restoration transforms a cliché into earned defiance. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
