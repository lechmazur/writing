<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. sisterly love) drive choices, but "heals with words" lacks visible struggle or cost, missing genuine flaw-complication in pivotal action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the city's shifted dreams reconfigure the burden with visible cost ("fear melted into curiosity"), though the cost's emotional weight feels slightly undercharged for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere powerfully, but the observatory tools/environments never constrain choices or charge the final image, capping at 8.8 per Q3 gate despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when deciphering transforms anxiety into actionable knowledge; protagonist's agency in sending the dream message narrows options with unmistakable cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("shared burden had become a shared history") resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, perfectly reweighting the premise through concrete change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragrant paper," "cold stone") modulates under pressure, but "heals with words" is told not shown, creating a minor voice leakage in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but paraphrase repetition ("silent, shared anxiety... no one could read" / "decode inscriptions... no one could read") triggers -0.2 per loop policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dream-archaeology tropes through celestial mechanics; the variable star as date is a fresh, inevitable synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
