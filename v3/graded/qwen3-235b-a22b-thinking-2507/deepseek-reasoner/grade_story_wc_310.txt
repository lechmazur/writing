<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("stellar doubt" vs purpose) embodied through coin handling and micro-choices; final renunciation of passive observation earned by her realization about the prophecy's reverse logic, though emotional cost remains slightly abstract beyond tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("she had wept with frustration" legible in final beat); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through static→music density shift, with prophecy's reversal reconfiguring options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber deck transitions from "beautiful tomb" preserving dead stars to transparent window for new universe, directly constraining her choice (static screens) and charging the final image; coins function as micro-setting for tangible action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (meaning of her role) tightens through her reframing of the prophecy, with escalation driven by agency (using coin's frequency); emotional cost of struggle made unmistakable via "wept with frustration" preceding the smile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (coins→seeds, static→music) without moralizing; final image reweights "cataloging death" into "singing first note" as resonant answer to purpose, avoiding simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("ambered observatory," "static bursts" filtered through composer's lens); rhythmic control shifts from lyrical despair to staccato action ("A new, fierce enthusiasm burned...") under pressure, with patterned elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("tarnished silver coin from her collection, feeling its milled edge") with propulsion through concrete verbs; no figurative muddle even in high-pressure climax where static crystallizes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy/conception metaphors through "wavelength align" as active creation; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with irreversible stakes (her tears/smile as necessary cost), avoiding derivative cosmic tropes.</comment>
