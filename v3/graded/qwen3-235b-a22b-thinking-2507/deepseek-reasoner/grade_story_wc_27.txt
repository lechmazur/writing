<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "awkwardly confident" stance crystallizing into certainty; embodied emotion ("toes curling against the grit") avoids label-speak. Final choice earned through prior causality with visible cost in rebels’ transformed resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: the projected cosmic vision reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("a jewel worth protecting"). Hybrid lens (Accumulative building to Situational) holds; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Repair bay’s "oil-stained permacrete" and monoliths constrain choice (vibration travels through feet) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity ("dust on the floor dance") mirrors internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (rebellion’s paralysis vs cosmic purpose) tighten through the hum’s escalation, narrowing options to witness over violence. Cost is unmistakable in rebels’ "silent, awe-struck" faces reigniting the fire "forged not in anger, but in awe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: stars shift from "mess of strewn constellations" to "blazing with purpose," rejecting moralizing. Final image answers "meaning in the mess" without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity"); rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("the hum reached its peak"). No head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical to urgent without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("cathedral to a dream of the stars that had died decades ago"). Minor repetition of "thunderous serenity" risks redundancy but pays off in closure. Final line’s "new night, full of potential" recharges motifs flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rebellion reignited through awe, not violence. Specific details (opera glasses, permacrete) ground cosmic stakes. Avoids derivative tropes via "meaning in the mess" reframing, resisting safety-hedging.</comment>
