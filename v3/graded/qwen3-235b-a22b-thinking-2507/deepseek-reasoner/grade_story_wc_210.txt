<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s rejection of "false comfort" drives every choice, with embodied motivation in pivotal moments like refusing to draw wishes out. Minor abstraction in "void no simple comfort could fill" slightly dilutes visceral stakes at the inciting point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the echoes’ "eternal remembrance" crystallizes the bittersweet trade-off. Orientation anchors instantly ("Paper-Lantern Cove," "deserted alchemist"), though the method’s deliberation lacks granular pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The paper lanterns function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—Elara’s refusal to "draw the wish out" reweights their purpose. Final image of "golden light stepped from paper confines" charges the environment irreplaceably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: rejecting false comfort forces the bottle’s repurposing. Cost is legible in the echoes’ "shimmering and translucent" nature, though the "days" of work slightly diffuse temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—touching lanterns to "connect" rather than extract wishes reweights remembrance. Final line "built a monument to it" avoids moralizing, but Q2’s 8.9 cap blocks 9.0 eligibility per cross-category rules.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemist-specific diction ("crystalline powder tuned to remembrance") creates a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythmic control peaks in the revival sequence where syntax mirrors resonant echoes, with no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "copper wires raced through streets" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "method came to her not in a flash..."—slight tell-y abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ghost town trope via alchemical memory mechanics—the bottle’s "resonance" concept feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk distinction earned through rejecting sentimentality for "authentic resonance," but Q2’s 8.9 cap limits higher bands.</comment>
