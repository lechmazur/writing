<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (suffocation vs grace) drives choices, but dock worker specificity doesn't constrain later tactics beyond initial setup; "fundamental severing" earns transformation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "great unspooling" legibly costs identity, with lens (Accumulative) holding through sensory escalation; orientation anchors by 80 words, serving the dissolution payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scrimshaw functions as micro-setting charging final image, but sublittoral fringe remains descriptive rather than constraining choices; black sand beach and island pulse brilliantly charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single stake (freedom through self-annihilation) tightens via scrimshaw's physical manifestations; detachment's cost ("fundamental severing") is unmistakable, though timeframe lacks live-clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the whale's transformation embodies "combative tenderness" without moralizing; final image reweights "freedom" as dissolution with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fluid grace," bone warmth) modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift ("profound song resonated") barely avoids dock-worker lexicon mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but "certainty that defied reason" uses tell-scaffold; high density maintained except for one paraphrase loop in discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "enchanted island" trope via biological impossibility premise; emotional specificity in surrender ("combative tenderness") avoids cliché while heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
