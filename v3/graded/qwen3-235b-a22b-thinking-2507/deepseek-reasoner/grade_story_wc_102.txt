<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("aching motivation" to find unused love) and micro-choices under pressure (breath control guiding light), but transformation lacks contradictory impulses; past-life integration feels too seamless without visible struggle in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with unmistakable cost ("pearl tear now gone"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increase in the healing sequence; minor deduction for rapid memory integration without tactical adaptation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Viaduct functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (luminescence clinging to stone), but fails the 9+ gate—granite/moss don't constrain choices; healing could occur anywhere, weakening causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via deepening (unused love shifts from quest to vesselhood), but escalation lacks visible price that charges the final image; cost (tear's loss) is present but not woven into the climactic healing action's physicality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("she was meant to be its vessel") reweights the core question through action (healing the viaduct), avoiding moralizing while making conceptual cost undeniable; thematic resonance emerges purely from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent like forgotten promises") and rhythmic control under pressure, but "spiritually curious" borders on abstract label without embodied tradeoffs in the healing sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "memory surfaced with tidal wave force" risks cliché in a peak beat; minor figurative muddle prevents 9.0 despite exceptional density in the light-unraveling sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" synthesizes spiritual tropes through specific, grounded choices (camera obscura as conduit), though Kwan Yin's tear edges toward familiar sacred objects without sufficient transformation.</comment>
