<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("heart hammered") and micro-choices (pressing stone), but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "shielded openness" trait stated but not tested under pressure. Flaws complicate choices credibly though.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: map tear reinterpreted as protection with visible cost ("keeper of a new-old secret"). Orientation clear by 50 words; Accumulative lens holds through light-pattern accumulation to resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault actively pressures discovery (rain affects light for video sync), while henge stones constrain choices via shadow physics. Final image charged by "resonant quiet" of root chamber – environment meets 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: video comparison deepens knowledge, pressing stone redefines options. Dominant stake (protecting secret) narrows to Earned Stasis with unmistakable cost ("sealed the stone... forever shielded"). Fits Accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: map tear's reinterpretation as protection avoids moralizing. Final image ("silence was not empty; it was layered") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without stated moral – meets 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("methodically curious" noticing light/shadow), rhythmic control evident in "relentless rain and slow, imperceptible wear." Zero head-hopping; compression taught early (film comparison) and paid off in closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("aggregate of countless whispered prayers" serves sensory/thematic/plot). Final line recharges "shielded openness" motif without muddle. Propulsion flawless even in high-pressure discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden chapel" trope through petrified roots absorbing sound – specific, verifiable detail creates freshness. Emotional truth in sealing secret avoids safety middle; risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes cohesively.</comment>
