<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fault-tolerance exceeded by brutal clarity of fact"; micro-choices like bare-hand sensor cleaning reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. No therapy-speak—sorrow embodied through physical collapse and the illustration’s return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "grim peace in having finally, truly seen" crystallizes the weight of certainty. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensor failures and narrowing options, culminating in the conduit discovery’s felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weather station functions as micro-setting: frozen gantry and cramped conduit directly constrain choices. Botanical illustration evolves from relic to thematic anchor, charging the final image with "something too fragile to survive."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency under accumulative lens: primary sensor failure forces conduit search, narrowing options to seconds. Cost is visceral—"numb thumb," despair wave—and reconfigures stakes in the final image’s "terrible anchor."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the illustration’s reprise: "fragile, high-altitude flower" becomes non-literal answer to climate fragility without moralizing. Final image reweights "fault-tolerance" as tragic clarity, avoiding tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lexicon ("rime of ice," "thermal paste") and rhythm shifts with pressure—staccato on gantry, fluid in fever aftermath. Zero register drift; "auroral sorrow" feels character-particular, not abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "baptism of ice" avoids purple prose via sensory precision. Minor deduction: "vicious mountain wind" slightly generic but redeemed by immediate concrete action ("slick under boots"). Closure beat crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "oracle" trope through sci-fi specificity: neural implant’s "fault tolerance" becomes tragic flaw when faced with irrefutable data. Emotional truth in "grim peace" avoids disaster clichés, synthesizing climate anxiety with personal fragility.</comment>
