<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through sensory action (polishing petals, tuning crystals), but lacks contradictory impulses in key decision; humming choice feels inevitable rather than conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: regret transforms to peace with visible cost ("foxglove standing sentinel" now joined by fulfillment), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where singing deepens resonance until dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal library and cracked bamboo actively constrain choices—bamboo’s flaw shapes solution, glass orchids demand vocal resonance; final image charges setting with "softly chiming flowers" weaving remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative deepening: bamboo’s distortion narrows options until humming unlocks resonance; cost legible as regret transforms amid "fleeting resurrection" of names.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of active remembrance emerges through particulars (lullaby, cracked chime), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "deserted marvels" without abstraction, though "duty fulfilled" edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shimmering vault," "ghost of former resonance") modulates under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s tapestry of whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Zero loops; "perpetual twilight bled amethyst" exemplifies high-density prose, but "profound peace of a duty fulfilled" slightly overwrites closure with abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "museum of extinct feelings" premise; risk-taking (sound as liberation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, reconfiguring "deserted marvels" through embodied action.</comment>
