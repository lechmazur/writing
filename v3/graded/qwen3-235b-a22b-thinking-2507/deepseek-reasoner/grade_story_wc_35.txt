<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Kaelen’s sacrifice ("sandpapered smooth for them, made his own rougher") earns closure with embodied cost. Elara’s grief lacks sufficient active pressure despite emotional contagion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("new stone in his gut") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Tidal pool analysis perfectly sets up the memory’s rhythm without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fossilized coral pavilion actively constrains tactics (kneeling at base, using tidal pool) and charges final image ("now-quiet coral"). Rainwater’s role as diagnostic tool elevates beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing boy without consumption) tightens through Kaelen’s methodical analysis, but Elara’s passive presence limits secondary pressure. Cost legibility ("heavy... remorse now part of him") anchors escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through culinary verbs ("sandpapering," "digesting") without moralizing. Final image reweights "rough memories" via Kaelen’s embodied cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: chef’s sensory lexicon ("electric tang of ozone," "complex broth of love") modulates under pressure. Coral’s "sigh" crystallizes voice without distortion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sturdy brittle" motif evolves organically. Slight register drift in "collective guilt of centuries" risks abstraction but redeemed by tactile follow-up ("seeping from the rock").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Memory-culinary fusion transforms trauma tropes through chef-specific tools (oils of forgetfulness, salts drawing pain). Risk-taking in sensory synesthesia heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
