<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s "steadily curious" trait drives discovery without therapy-speak; embodied through measuring tape actions. Minor lack of contradictory impulses during climax prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with conceptual cost (inherited duty). Rain’s shift from distortion to "constellation" reweights meaning flawlessly under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (measuring tape) constrains choices; rain-beaded glass evolves from distorting city lights to revealing connections. Final image charges the tool’s irreplaceable role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elara’s agency: measuring tape discovery forces path from study to keeper. Cost of inherited duty lands through final "web of duty" image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resilience theme emerges through brittle journal and circuit card—no moralizing. Final image reweights "steady rhythm of rain" as footsteps, offering non-literal answer to collapse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "distorting city lights" and "onyx ink" observations. Rhythmic control peaks when curiosity "ignited into a focused blaze" during high-pressure discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rain pattered a soft rhythm" to "rhythm... sounded like footsteps" recharges motif. Final line’s "ready to begin" avoids overwriting while deepening closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms cartomancy via crypto crash context; measuring tape’s schematic role feels inevitable. Specificity (The Circuit card, onyx ink) avoids generality while risking lyrical compression.</comment>
