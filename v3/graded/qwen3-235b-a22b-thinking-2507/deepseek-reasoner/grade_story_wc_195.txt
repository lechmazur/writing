<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: armor heavy with silence yet seeking possibility. Embodied hesitation—clumsy gauntlets on luminous clasps—avoids diagnostic labels. Final soul-lightening earns endurance, but orchard voice slightly undermines pure agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "armor begin to lighten, not physically, but in his soul" crystallizes cost. Accumulative lens holds—each unsnapping tightens reality’s tremors. Persistent constraint (armor weight) shapes the final image, but orchard instruction edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices: unstable ground forces careful steps, light-threads demand physical manipulation. Final image charged by "frosted dew that glowed" evolving into orchard’s "silent celebration." Micro-setting (gauntlets) alters tactics during unsnapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally: reality’s "shifting waves" narrow to "terrifying and ecstatic rush" during unsnappings. Cost is visceral (soul-lightening), but "shape of possibility" remains abstract. Agency drives escalation, though orchard voice softens antagonistic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: unsnapping threads reweights "abandoned program" into possibility-key. Final image ("silent squire for the world to come") answers central question without moralizing. No thematic echo—bliss embodies earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: withdrawn knight notices "path of white stones," not beauty. Rhythm accelerates during unsnappings ("He worked faster now"), breathes at climax. Orchard’s vibration stays focalized—zero head-hopping, even with non-human voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "vines wove equations of light" integrates texture/action. Figurative language serves pressure: "armor grown heavier with silence" concretizes emotion. Minor dilution— "shivering bliss" repetition—but intentional resonance, not scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tropes transformed: knight as observer, puppet as possibility-key. Emotional truth anchors concept—Alistair’s quiet desperation resonates beyond heroics. "Silver bells instead of fruit" specificity avoids abstraction, but orchard voice slightly leans on familiar mysticism.</comment>
