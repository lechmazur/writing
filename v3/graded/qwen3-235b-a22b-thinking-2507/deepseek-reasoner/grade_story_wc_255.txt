<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian's motivation—finding beauty in imperfection due to colorblindness—is embodied through his tactile focus on glass flaws and the visceral cost of seeing red. Contradictory impulses (yearning for color vs. devotion to grey-world truth) act in scene during the trade proposal. Slight abstraction in "profound personal beauty" edges toward thematic tell, but final choice earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: Elian's worldview shatters when he sees red, yet he chooses the imperfect leaf, foreclosing his quest for color. Causal chain (reed → plant bellows → rose → vision) holds with visible cost ("single, profound shade of red"). Phoenix backdrop slightly ornamental but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass tree's bubbles/warps and living plants directly constrain choices—ivy becomes bellows, the rose's crimson core charges the final image. Sensory details ("shattering crystal" laugh, ozone scent) serve urgency. Minor deduction for generic "eastern sky" not leveraging location specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: Kaela's rose flaw (needs song) escalates to Elian's risky trade. His agency drives the climax—persuading plants to form bellows—redefining options when the note awakens the rose. Cost is visceral (worldview rupture), but residual phoenix heat lacks causal traction on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "interesting failures" philosophy and the flawed leaf's value. Final red shade reweights imperfection as profound beauty without moralizing. "Bartered promise" slightly literalizes theme, but charged image avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian's perceptual signature shines ("gradients of grey," "emotional weight of shadow"). Voice modulates under pressure—compression during plant persuasion ("asking, persuading"). Minor filter-verb accumulation ("he told her") edges toward explanatory telling in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops; "residual heat and scent of ozone" integrates action. Near-closure, "light, true and brilliant" risks abstraction but is redeemed by "true" reflecting Elian's perspective. Deducted for "mad and magnificent" abstraction and scaffold phrase "it was how he compensated."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: colorblindness as compulsion (not tragedy), bartered awakening as mutual artistic exchange. Plant-bellows mechanic feels fresh and necessary. Phoenix backdrop slightly derivative but redeemed by specific concertina reed integration. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
