<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (grounding spirits via physical acts) is clear and embodied through micro-choices like selecting the specific knot and gold sutures. Interior contradiction emerges subtly in her focus versus the spirit's cold presence, but Kael remains functional pressure without deeper relationship crucible. Flaws avoid safety-hedging, though internal conflict could deepen beyond professional focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the slackened net and mended mask crystallize options with visible cost ("harmless weave of hemp," spirit dissolving into silence). Accumulative lens holds—silence thickens as starlight flickers—until the unraveling reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors by word 50 with prism light and sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary actively constrains choices: fractured light enables knot identification, while the "velvet" silence pressures Elara's work. The needle and net evolve from tools to truth conduits, charging the final image where starlight illuminates the sutured mask. Environment isn't backdrop but tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens—each loosened filament tightens emotional density until the spirit materializes. Cost is visceral: the net's slackness and temperature drop prove the "lucid unrest" reweighted. Dominant stake (grounding spirits) narrows options to truth-exhumation, with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the gold-sutured mask reweights "brokenness" as wholeness without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer to grief—acknowledging fractures enables peace—avoiding false binaries. Spirit's malice-driven drowning deepens complexity; no thematic echo contaminates the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spectral hues," "velvet silence") filters all details through Elara's restorative lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during unraveling heighten tension. No head-hopping; single POV maintained even with Kael's dialogue. Minor register drift in "lucid unrest" repetition avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("she found it—a grotesque snarl"). Figurative language ("ghosts of ancient catches") serves character and stakes without muddle. Final image ("serene, accumulated silence") crystallizes closure without overwriting. Text-artifact screen passes with clean cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: mask restoration via net-unraveling transforms grief ritual tropes. Prism light as surgical tool and gold sutures honoring breaks feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking heightens stakes—truth-exhumation via knots avoids sentimentality—while conceptual integrity commits to "breaks not hidden." No derivative echoes.</comment>
