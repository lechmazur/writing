<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in crystallizing magic as both curse and story, but childhood superstition memory lacks prior anchoring; micro-choice to reinterpret breath as ward earns closure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("history forever transformed") under Accumulative lens; "saturated hush fulfilled by meaning" crystallizes pressure shift, though superstition’s late relevance slightly undermines causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the scar-turned-tattoo constrains choice (ink application) and charges final image with gem-like facets; "floating platform" remains atmospheric without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through breath-duration pressure ("measured not in seconds, but in sustained suspension"), crystallizing magic forcing trade-off between suppression and alchemy; cost legible in "refined strength" but superstition shortcut softens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar alchemy ("weakness into armor"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "breath between storms" as transformative space, though "chronicle etched in skin" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound like a secret whispered," "effervescent dust") modulates under stress; rhythm accelerates during crystallization crisis, no POV leakage despite intense interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("crystallizing magic was not a flaw... but a part of the story") and mixed metaphor ("shed, like a snake sheds skin") in climax beat; otherwise exceptional density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rune magic with embodied trauma; "crystallized essence" trope transformed through specific alchemy process, though floating platform setting risks generic fantasy without deeper integration.</comment>
