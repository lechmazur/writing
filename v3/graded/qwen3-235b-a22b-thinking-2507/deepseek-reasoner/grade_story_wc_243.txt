<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "haunted euphoria" and tearful smile; "gently thorough" trait constrains action via noticing "faint cry of long-ago grief" with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("her own life was the ink"); accumulative lens holds through density shift in vision beat reweighting the jetty's existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty's bioluminescent moss constrains choice (timing of steeping) and charges final image (blooms pulsing with heartbeat); "walnut-ink" specificity shapes profession and covenant logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via covenant vision's conceptual cost; "violent crimson" photo creates irreversible knowledge shift narrowing Elara's options from observer to participant with felt weight of centuries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "small moments" motif reweighted by locket's warmth and jetty's pulse; avoids moralizing via concrete image of tearful smile bearing "immense weight" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sepia-toned ink" and "blooming jetty" lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure ("water began to glow... deep red") with purposeful compression paid off in vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "ceramic bowl" detail simultaneously grounds action, reveals profession, and charges closure; "pulsating blue light" to "deeper blue" evolution avoids static description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist mythos through walnut ink specificity; risk-taking in quiet covenant revelation avoids tropes by making "life as ink" conceptually inevitable through proximate cause mechanics.</comment>
