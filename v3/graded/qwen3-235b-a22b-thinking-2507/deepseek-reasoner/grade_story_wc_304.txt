<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids abstraction through embodied actions ("heartbeat became a distant rumor") and micro-choices (cupping chip, breath control). Contradictory impulses—exhaustion vs. duty—crystallize in the infusion act with visible cost ("weary and hollowed out").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the geomancer's ghost-smile reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (Elara's depletion). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as stillness deepens via sensory density ("crackle of green noise"), narrowing options to a single decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (sifting static for memory) and charging closure (turning grey as memory transfers). Aurora’s light actively interacts with the gem, avoiding postcard description through causal pressure on the method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s deepening stillness (heartbeat as "distant rumor"), narrowing options to one path. Cost is felt in her depletion, but the single escalation lacks a visible trade-off like time or physical sacrifice that would elevate to 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically: "beauty preserved before eternal dark" resonates through the boy’s memory infusion without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise—oblivion isn’t defeat but integration—avoiding Thematic Echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lucidly watchful grace," "psychic residue") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in high-stakes beats ("a soft, verdant luminescence traveled... seeped into his chest"), with no head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "radiant hush" repetitions (paragraphs 1 and 5) triggers −0.2. Otherwise, high density and propulsion: "taste of deep soil, pressure of mountain roots" layers meaning without scaffold. Final image crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortician/beautician role with geomancy creates emotional specificity. Risk-taking (internal stillness as climax) heightens stakes coherently—the "threshold" isn’t abstract but embodied in heartbeat fading, avoiding safety-middle genericity.</comment>
