<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation ("learn why some people echo") drives tangible choices under pressure, with embodied perception ("discern a lie in the tremor of a returned note"). Merchant’s hollow echo reveals moral void, but his confession lacks sufficient internal struggle to fully earn his collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "clarity of soul" insight reweights the premise with undeniable cost in the merchant’s "true hollowness." Causal lens holds throughout, but shell mechanics feel slightly convenient in the serpentine nexus confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon acoustics function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (navigating by "shadow weaves," shattering echoes). Whispering shell charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement by shaping Lyra’s decisive action and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving resonance) escalates causally: shell warning → journey → plot discovery → confrontation. Cost crystallizes in the merchant’s collapse, but the "webs of intrigue" revelation slightly compresses the moral stakes without deeper friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: shattered echoes = stolen soul-songs, final insight avoids moralizing. The "clarity of soul" realization reweights the echo metaphor non-literally, with no thematic echo or abstraction marring the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reed-blown melancholy," cosmic hum in teeth) modulates perfectly under pressure. Slight abstraction in "lonely music" early on, but rhythmic control intensifies toward the cleansing note without head-hopping or POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise ("sobbing breath caught between the cliffs"), with zero scaffold in peak beats. Minor rhythmic repetition ("hummed"/"thrum") in Q2 creates negligible drag, but closure imagery remains razor-sharp with high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via acoustics-based magic system; "echo = soul clarity" premise feels fresh and inevitable. Risky poetic density pays off cohesively, though the shell’s sentience edges toward convenient without deeper mythic grounding.</comment>
