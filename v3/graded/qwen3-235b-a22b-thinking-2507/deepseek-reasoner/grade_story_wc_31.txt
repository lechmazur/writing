<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (yearning vs. routine) manifests in concrete micro-choices (pocketing key, touching sphere), but "truth he hid behind" risks label-speak without immediate embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("he wept") under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via sensory deepening, though the water-being's appearance slightly edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pier planks, key tag, and luminous water actively constrain choices (rotten wood, hatch access) and charge the final image; sensory specificity ("slick, algae-covered hatchway") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (yearning for meaning) deepens via sensory escalation; cost is legible in emotional vulnerability, but external pressure lacks tangible constraint beyond the water's hum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (color/sound synesthesia as covenant), but "truth that needed no hiding" flirts with thematic echo; avoids moralizing via resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("man-made stars," "meteor hush") with rhythmic control; voice modulates under pressure without elision issues, taught through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion with zero loops; "silent, roaring concert of light" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose, though "foolish and persistent" slightly over-tells early motivation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "color of sound" trope through maritime specificity and luminous vows; risks poetic abstraction but anchors freshness in Silas's embodied discovery with felt cost.</comment>
