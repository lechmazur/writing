<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in synesthetic perception versus scientific rigour; micro-choices navigating shipwrecks reveal her obsession's cost. No second character present, so relationship bullets irrelevant. Final endurance (carrying the sound) earns closure with tears and fading vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: vent activity intensifies sensory density until capture moment. Closure is Conceptual Repricing ("some things not meant to be fixed") with felt cost in tears and obsidian fade. Orientation clear by sentence one: submersible under pressure hunting a ghost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sunken orchard constrains every choice—timing during vent surges, navigation through trees. The ashen forge's "false aurora" directly charges the final image of her ascent. Micro-setting (hearing aid crystal) enables the climax's physical act of imprinting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the vent's volatile window ("while cells divide"), narrowing options to one attempt. Agency is pure attention: capturing the fracture requires precise sensory endurance. Cost is legible in her "tears mix with condensation" during the obsidian shattering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through synesthesia—"leaden gray of forgetting" bleeding into betrayal's red—not stated moral. Final image ("carrying the sound of a broken heart") reweights the quest as witnessing, not healing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific lexicon ("geothermal vents," "sonic void") fused with sensory poetry ("silent scream," "bioluminescent glow"). Rhythmic control under pressure in climax beats ("shattering prism of obsidian and ice cracks across her vision").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "shattering prism of obsidian and ice" risks purple prose but earns payoff through visceral cost. Zero loops or scaffold. Final line ("carrying the sound... back to the man who taught her how to listen") recharges the opening's "battered marvel" with devastating specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via synesthetic hearing aid design and sunken orchard graveyard. "Collecting absences" feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk: making trust's fracture a physical shockwave ("negative space") that charges every image without abstraction.</comment>
