<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hopeful melancholy" as embodied action—not labels—drives the climax. Flaw: no contradictory impulses *in scene* during the pivotal lodestone shift; precision overrides struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: shifting the stone reconfigures exile with felt cost in the dent’s transformation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "eclipsed covenant" backstory slightly overpowers present causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus constrains every choice—Elara *must* read sand patterns to act. Basalt stone’s dent charges the final image, proving environment-as-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: decoding the vortex narrows options to one move. Cost is legible in the "bittersweet home" realization, though "before next phase" deadline feels slightly external.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "beauty in the difficult" resolves in the stone’s dent, not moralizing. Final image reweights exile as home without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—chess logic filters all observation ("rook’s move," "knight’s fork"). Rhythm modulates under pressure; no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, but "hopeful melancholy" edges toward tell-y abstraction early. Figurative language ("frantic jig") risks muddle yet avoids harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy with natural systems avoids tropes. Specific details (iron filaments, basalt dent) transform "exile" into visceral emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
