<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but internal conflict minimal. Scout’s presence reveals no new values or flaws—only functional tool. Micro-choices serve ritual mechanics without layered emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: echo preserved at cost of Elara’s exhaustion and scout’s lost understanding. Orientation anchors early; accumulative/textural lens (density escalation via ritual intensification) holds through closure with felt cost ("body weary," scout’s confusion).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet and murmuring pavilion constrain choices—binding requires the stone’s depth. Final image ("echo hum for centuries") charges setting with irreversible cost. Micro-setting (sand, light patterns) directly shapes the ritual’s execution and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (preserve fading echo) tightens through ritual pressure and scout’s accidental honesty. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: his presence clarifies the echo, raising cost (her focus, his eventual amnesia). Cost unmistakable in closure beat’s physical/emotional duality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral wisdom emerges through ritual mechanics, not moralizing. Final image (echo humming in stone) reweights the prophet’s vanishing with conceptual cost—preservation demands sacrifice of immediate understanding, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("psychic hum," peripheral awareness) defines voice; rhythm shifts from "whisperfield calm" to ritual intensity. No head-hopping; scout’s dialogue carries subtext. Elision (prophet’s words as light patterns) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor register drift ("whisperfield calm" feels slightly forced) but no closure artifacts. Zero loops; high density in ritual execution. Final line’s "immense, silent dunes" crystallizes cost without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms mystical ritual trope through concrete mechanics (light patterns, kinetic parapet). Risk-taking in quiet climax—preservation via exhaustion, not triumph—feels inevitable. Avoids abstraction with "porcelain plate," "ochre sand" specificity.</comment>
