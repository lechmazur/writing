<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (obsession vs. exhaustion) drives closure; embodied cost in "muscle burned/eyes stung" makes renunciation credible. Slight abstraction in "captured infinity" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: clutching the booklet as dawn erases the night. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—silence deepens from "ambered" to "marbled" hush, narrowing options to one final stroke.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the flaking gold booklet constrains every choice (fragile pages, nightshade ink) and charges the final image as "kingdom" holder. Ridge fort's sea spray forces urgency without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through sensory deepening: silence's "marbled" texture and star's pulse raise cost until physical exhaustion ("arm burned") forces closure. Agency is flawless—brushstrokes narrow options to one decisive summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "map of nothingness" crystallizes silence as preservable. Final image ("map to a state of being") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: cartographer’s POV shapes all description ("topography of silence"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short phrases for tension ("Then, she began"), flowing clauses for dawn’s arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crushed nightshade" and "coastline of quietude" exemplify textural specificity. Final line’s "star faded from view" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "artist capturing ephemera" trope through hyper-specific cartographic logic. Risk-taking (silence as topography) heightens stakes organically; no derivative elements.</comment>
