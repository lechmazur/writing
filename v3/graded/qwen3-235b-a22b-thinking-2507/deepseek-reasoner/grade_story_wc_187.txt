<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (sculpting identity vs avoiding self), but "preemptive nostalgia" borders on label-speak; micro-choice raising quill reveals value hierarchy under pressure with embodied cost ("sharp ache").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "she was not separate... keeper" crystallizes stance with visible cost ("calm not felt in years"); Accumulative lens holds as shadow shifts reweight identity with felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (measuring shadows on whispering stones) and charges closure ("silent sea below" mirrors acceptance); solidified fog as sheer cliff creates tangible spatial stakes throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (identity through memory) tighten via internal deepening, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure escalation; the monument whisper catalyzes crisis without narrowing options beyond prior established doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "adding her own story to the whole" reweighting "collective memory" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite "sculpt identity" proximity to prompt language through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glassine plain," "crystal whispering forecourt") modulates rhythm with emotional intensity; consistent psychic distance maintains archivist's lyrical precision under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("monuments were not stone but pillars of captured light") propels momentum; minor synonym churn ("deepening hush"/"hush deepened") avoids penalty through intentional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-physical-substance (solidified fog, whispering crystals) transforms archivist trope; emotional specificity in "preemptive nostalgia" avoids generic templates despite familiar premise.</comment>
