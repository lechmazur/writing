<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (expunge vs. bear witness) act simultaneously in the bottle discovery; the Earned Stasis choice—carrying memory instead of burying it—is earned by prior causality with embodied cost in the "sacred silence holding space for his grief."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: Elias’s renunciation of expunging memory crystallizes in the hearthstone moment ("he would not bury the past again"), reconfiguring his purpose under Accumulative/Textural lens with felt grief in the "mirrored hush deepened."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sapphire bottle label constrains choice (triggers personal pilgrimage) and charges the final image (held "in careful keeping of his heart"), but micro-setting depth lacks slight specificity—e.g., how mud’s texture alters his grip during pivotal actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: the bottle transforms "professional record" to "personal pilgrimage," narrowing options to bearing witness; cost is unmistakable in the "sacred silence holding space for his grief" as he accepts emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (photographs, bottle, hearthstone), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights the central question ("spin stories into shared meaning") as carrying memory, with no stated moral—only the "new tale he would now tell" resonating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal picket fence," "captured blue light") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "systematic cataloging of a trauma" slightly over-articulates for mid-crisis thought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ghostly white stark against the mud") but slight figurative muddle in "mirrored hush" (physical vs. emotional reflection) in peak beats prevents 9.0 despite otherwise flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reservoir-as-metaphor for memory burial transforms tropes; the specific "sapphire-hued liqueur label" (not generic bottle) and "rusty tin box" deepen emotional truth without quirky ornament, heightening stakes through lived detail.</comment>
