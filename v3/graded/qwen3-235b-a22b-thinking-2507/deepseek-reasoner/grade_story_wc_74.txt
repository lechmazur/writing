<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (exhaustion vs methodical hope) drives choices; embodied emotions layer realistically as strangers recognize ancestral kindnesses with breath-hitched vulnerability. Final rest earned through vigilance, not epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the sailor's grandson's cracked whisper ("My grandfather... no one believed him") crystallizes inherited truth with visible emotional toll. Accumulative lens holds through waxing moon progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse constrains choice as sanctuary where moonlight enables vision-painting; saffron crocuses and moon-tipped brush recur to charge final image. Sensory specificity ("grimed with residue of a million breaths") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) tightens through accumulated visions, culminating in recognition scenes where cost is visceral (trembling fingers, hitched breaths). Agency lies in Elara's nightly painting choices under moon's pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the bread-sharing alley and lifeboat freshwater become non-literal proof of inherited kindness. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "saffron quiet" as earned communal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bleary hues of exhaustion," "saffron quiet") reflects Elara's insomnia. Voice modulates from weary to luminous under moonlight; lyric compression taught early ("stubbornly blank canvas stood accused") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "methodically hopeful" avoids label-speak through concrete actions (palette of dried paints, tracing exhaustion). Slight density dip in "thousand kindnesses swallowed by time" but closure beats remain sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism trope through specificity: saffron crocuses, smog-choked city, and "saffron quiet" create fresh emotional texture. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off with Charged Poise closure that feels inevitable.</comment>
