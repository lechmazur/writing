<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("assumed void was chaos" vs. "potential") drives crisis; embodied micro-choice to cease looping reveals value hierarchy with cost in raw static agony. No label-speak; "hands trembled" shows struggle without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "screaming crimson flowed onto the slate" legibly charges cost of dissolved certainty. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via density increase (static's rhetorical assault) and pattern break (silver/crimson dialogue). Cost proof: "agony. revelation." crystallizes trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Palette functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (trembling over lone color, receiving crimson) and charging final image. Loses points: dimensional anchor lacks tactile specificity—static remains abstract "cacophony" without physical constraints on movement or tools beyond palette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: entity's "grinding glass" rhetoric deepens pressure by weaponizing Ansel's methods, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral—"raw void-static washed over... agony"—and alters tactics (receiving vs. defending). Agency clear in cessation choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from silver/crimson interplay: "wholeness requires multiplicity" reweights premise via final "complex chord" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; entity's "you build with one note" serves conflict, not author sermon. Final image answers central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: sonic metaphors ("muffled clarity," "sonic tapestry") reflect priest's reality. Rhythm modulates under pressure (lyrical to staccato "Agony. Revelation."). Zero POV leakage; "repressed frequency" slightly over-explains but doesn't break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "screaming cacophony of formless color" does triple duty (sensory/emotional/thematic). Final line's cadence resolves rhythm perfectly. Only flaw: "repressed frequency" slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms priest/void trope via sonic theology—"loop pedal priest" and palette constraint feel organic. Emotional truth in crisis of faith avoids generic templates. Loses 0.2: integration resolution slightly familiar despite fresh execution.</comment>
