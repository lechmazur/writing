<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("sharp and constant ache") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices lack visible struggle during weaving climax despite clear motivation. Final endurance earns stasis but misses 9+ requirement for simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("light would require constant tending") under Accumulative lens. Orientation solid by paragraph 1; lens clarity established through density-building thread-weaving sequence. Cost proof evident in "saved for now" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("ozone and nostalgia," "phosphorescent rows") filtered through Lyra's memory-keeper bias. Fails 9+ gate: greenhouse setting supplies resources but doesn't constrain choices; no object charges final image despite strong atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lyra's agency as thread-weaving narrows options from solitary act to communal reawakening. Cost ("daily singing") visibly charges final image under Accumulative lens. Escalation flawless: humming to singing shifts from individual to collective action with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "woven dawns" motif reweighted in closure ("memory of light had become light itself"). Final image offers non-literal answer to rekindling hope without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via earned fragility ("realm was not yet saved").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaves whispered of forgotten songs") with rhythmic control in high-pressure weaving sequence. Minor register drift in "profound, quiet joy" doesn't undermine consistent voice. Patterned elision of backstory taught early via "borrowed moments" cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "swaddle the cold, dark heart" exemplifies textural specificity. One borderline abstraction ("profound, quiet joy") in climax lacks full embodiment but doesn't dull closure image. Propulsion flawless through varied syntax in singing sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" transforms memory trope through alchemical specificity; emotional truth avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable via thread-weaving mechanics established early.</comment>
