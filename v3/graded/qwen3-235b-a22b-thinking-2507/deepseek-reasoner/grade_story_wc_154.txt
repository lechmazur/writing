<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Elara's drugged detachment versus professional urgency ("chemical fog—cutting through") fuels her micro-choice to decode the cast. Flaws feel earned—her Pacific trauma informs but doesn't dictate, avoiding diagnostic label-speak as she embodies "a map of old tensions" during the boy's breakthrough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the coral felt less like a charm and more like a promise" reweights meaning with visible cost ("profound exhaustion"). Accumulative lens holds—each smudged note decryption tightens the emotional pressure until the boy’s whisper releases the "shared anxiety," crystallizing stakes without causal loopholes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brain coral functions as essential micro-setting: it constrains Elara’s approach (she must hold it to engage the boy) and charges the final image where its meaning shifts from "charm" to "promise." Mist and twilight aren’t backdrop but active pressure—blurring vision to mirror the boy’s fractured memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through protagonist agency: Elara’s decryption ("Mark? Marcus?") transforms abstract "shared anxieties" into concrete, felt cost as the boy’s "rusty but clear" whisper releases the tension. One deepening—deciphering the cast’s panic script—narrows options to this single, earned breakthrough without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the coral’s "memory of the sea" mirrors how trauma must be "held" to heal, culminating in the final image where it becomes a "promise" of growth. Avoids moralizing—the "lotus-hearted ache" isn’t explained but embodied through Elara’s exhaustion and the boy’s tear tracing "a clean path through grime."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elara’s translator mind "switching modes" filters panic scribbles as "cipher," while "woolly tide" anesthetic imagery reflects her altered state. Voice modulates perfectly—slurred urgency ("May I?") shifts to deliberate softness ("It remembers") under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sweat or tears" and "squiggle as 'my mom’s blue shirt'" showcase textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "brittle silences of the Pacific conflict zone" (redundant with later trauma cues) costs 0.2, but propulsion never stalls—sentences accelerate as she deciphers the cast’s "jagged line" to "dark smear."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through grounded detail: the coral isn’t mystical but a "porous object" Elara carries, and the boy’s muteness breaks via graphite smudges, not therapy-speak. Fresh inflection in "gardener tending a wounded thing" reconfigures translation as healing, avoiding abstract "anxieties" for tactile "grooves in the plaster."</comment>
