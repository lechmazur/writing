<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (turning blindly) reveal hierarchy of values; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak. "Boundary-lessly trapped" trait drives collapse but slightly abstract in early exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: near-entombment reversed through reorientation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; star-pattern solution reweights stakes without coincidence. Orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass pedestal and lamp constrain every choice; final image charged by their transformation. Sensory hierarchy (wet metal scent during crisis) reflects urgency. "Frozen moss" crystals mirror internal state through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving sorrows without collapse) tightens through calcification crisis. Agency-driven escalation (reorientation choice) narrows options with felt cost: near-loss of self becomes freedom. Single deepening suffices masterfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("it did not demand to be carried; it asked only to be seen") reweights burden/counterweight theme without moralizing. Complexity in "testament" vs "entombment" avoids false balance. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") creates distinct texture. Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented crisis to flowing resolution. Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "calcified, capturing essence" demonstrates high density. Figurative language serves pressure ("mimicry of the sky" during hope). Final line's internal light recharges motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Fractal weaver" trope transformed via specific physics (weaving through flame). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes; bronze grotto's star-alignment logic feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
