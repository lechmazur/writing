<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's mechanical arm embodies internal conflict through tactile detail ("clicked, calculating"), but her epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; the "how to build" realization reads as tidy resolution rather than earned struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the sundial completion symbolizing collaboration, but the conceptual cost ("division to creation") remains abstract without visceral bodily or relational consequence on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial constrains choice by dictating movement logic, and the clockwork hand charging the final image satisfies 9+ gate; however, the brook's sensory detail lacks causal pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via the needle card cipher revealing alliance intent, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost—Kaelen's shift feels convenient, missing the required visible price for high-band entry under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sundial completion as "bridge not wall," but the final paragraph's explicit "decoded the invitation" constitutes thematic echo, triggering penalty for stating the story's thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara's mechanical-arm-calibration POV ("gears whirred softly as counterpoint"), though dialogue converges toward closure without sufficient lexical differentiation between philosophers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero loops and strong propulsion, but "dignified chaos resolved into perfect, peaceful sense" creates a mixed metaphor that dulls closure image, violating text-artifact guard for peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosophical duel with coded sundial mechanics feels inevitable, though "dueling ideas" premise risks template familiarity without deeper transformation of the conflict genre.</comment>
