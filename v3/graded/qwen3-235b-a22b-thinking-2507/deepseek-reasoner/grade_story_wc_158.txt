<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied pain ("acid of wakeful anguish"), but contradictory impulses lack depth beyond compulsion/endurance. Final choice lacks visible trade-off; "exquisite wrenching" risks abstract phrasing in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (wind's dissonance resolving) with conceptual cost (pain's return acknowledged), but cost legibility falters—exhaustion feels earned yet nebulous. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds impeccably through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell constrains choice (ensconcing in alcove) and charges closure (reef-shadow joy as environmental metaphor). Bioluminescent light, wind hum, and nacre texture filter through Elara’s poetic lens, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (world’s peace vs. pain’s return) deepen through lullabies’ dissonance resolving into pure note, but escalation lacks tangible cost—Elara’s exhaustion feels emotional rather than tactical. Agency (writing as photosynthesis) drives pressure coherently under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "blossom armistice" as non-literal answer to pain/beauty duality. Final nebula pulse reweights longing into fragile hope without moralizing, though "shyly unstoppable hope" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cathedral of nacre," "off-key thrum vibrating in teeth") modulates with pressure. Prose rhythm mirrors wind’s dissonance-to-harmony shift, with no head-hopping or register drift in high-stakes writing sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "half-sung lullabies" and "reef-shadow joy" avoid cliché through specificity. Minor deduction: "exquisite wrenching" slightly abstracts spiritual pain in climax beat, risking therapy-speak per anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insomnia, shell acoustics, and photosynthesis metaphor feels inevitable. "Blossom armistice" transforms war tropes into intimate ceasefire, while "reef-shadow joy" delivers fresh emotional specificity beyond generic peace.</comment>
