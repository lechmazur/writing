<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Curator's embodied listening shows micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses or visible struggle; her flawless discernment avoids genuine flaws that could compound choices. Matteo's backstory reveals motivation without testing her limitations in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the mailbox yields through collective witness, not force, with cost legible in the "profound, shared silence." Accumulative lens holds as story density ("rhythmic click" resonance) reweights stakes without causality breaks, though the heartbeat metaphor slightly edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting constrains choices—locket pattern matches mailbox impression, eastern archway shadow guides the search—and charges the final image. "Sandstorm calm" evolves from muffled stillness to "potent peace," avoiding postcard description through tactile details like dusty-pink mailbox paint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when curator chooses silence over forcing the mailbox, drawing residents to speak; cost is felt in the shared silence after finding the deed. Agency as pure attention forecloses physical intervention, but eviction backstory lacks immediate pressure, slightly diluting escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: locket as "guide," not key; mailbox opening via witness, not force. Final line ("to hear is sometimes to save") avoids moralizing by being earned through the curator’s restraint and the deed’s tangible proof, reweighting "history locked away" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Curator’s perceptual signature shines ("fingers trained to discern value," noticing "sandstorm calm"), but slight POV drift in "resonance of collective memory" blurs whether this is her interpretation or omniscient insight. Matteo’s distinct voice ("dry rustle," "men with papers") avoids convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines do triple duty (e.g., "brittle photograph... smiling in this very courtyard" conveys history, emotion, and setting). "Sandstorm calm" metaphor remains fresh and legible through closure, with no figurative muddle in the high-pressure mailbox scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "historical artifact" trope via tactile mechanics: locket as diagram, mailbox yielding to witness not tools. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality—resolution hinges on the deed’s practical power, not just nostalgia—making the courtyard’s communal memory feel lived-in and irreplaceable.</comment>
