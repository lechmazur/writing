<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "laughter a sharp, bright thing against the pervasive gloom" versus "hollow inside her," but the pivotal shift to using the moon rock lacks a visceral micro-choice showing cost—motivation remains abstractly "cure for loneliness" without concrete sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "eyes no longer downcast," crystallizing reciprocity’s emotional cost, yet the astronomer’s arrival via rumor risks coincidence complicating rather than escalating causal pressure under the Situational lens dominant at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station actively constrains choices (pallets framing communion), with "damp earth and old metal" sensory specificity charging the final image—micro-setting of moon rock in hands embodies cosmic connection, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Loneliness stake tightens through the rock ritual’s escalation, but the astronomer’s gift feels unearned; pressure lacks a visible price paid *by Elara* during the pivotal decision to catalyze the rumor, softening the cost legibility required for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "shared, silent wonder" rather than stated morals, with the moon rock reweighted as "a question that demanded a human answer," yet "cure for loneliness" phrasing flirts with thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "polite anarchy" lexicon and rhythmic control under pressure ("rusted husks of trains," "gossamer thread of rumor"); free indirect style cleanly renders Elara’s shift from "desperately jocular" to "serene focus" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("fragments of moon rock, a grey, unassuming piece of another world"), but "profound isolation" edges toward abstraction in peak beats, and "cosmic connection" risks thematic overstatement without tighter textual grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms disaster-relief tropes through "distributing grace" premise, with ivy station and moon rock synthesizing specificity, yet the astronomer’s reciprocity concept leans slightly on familiar emotional logic without fresh moral calculus.</comment>
