<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Leo reframes curse as puzzle despite isolation; "spirit tempered with profound understanding" earns closure with visible cost. Avoids diagnostic labels by embodying emotion through action ("training kicked in"). Slight flaw: secondary characters absent limits relationship crucible testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when turning hourglass merges timelines; cost crystallizes in "tempered with profound understanding" and final keeper identity. Hybrid lens (causal actions + accumulative radio patterns) holds from anomaly to restoration. Orientation anchored by paragraph one with zero disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hourglass constrains all key choices (placement/turning) and charges final image as "forgotten paperweight," reweighting transience. Ferry-specific tools (marine radio, deck brush) and salt spray details shape tactics. Grotto's "shimmering echoes" directly enable solution without symbolic shouting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Leo's agency: radio call detects coordinates, steering toward cavern, placing hourglass. Cost is visceral—his reality dissolves and reforms, leaving "profound understanding" as tangible tradeoff. Dominant stake (fixing fractured time) tightens via radio patterns narrowing options to one decisive action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ferry-specific particulars: "permanent transience" reframed as "singular and sure" journey via hourglass mechanics. Final image (paperweight, deck brush) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action—"weaving frayed ends" shown, not told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sailor lexicon ("training kicked in," "deep hum of engine") and pressure-modulated rhythm (crisis = short sentences, grotto = lyrical flow). Zero head-hopping; radio's "chaotic symphony" teaches elision early. Slight abstraction in "instinctual pull" redeemed by immediate action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each line advances plot (e.g., "radio responded not with static but symphony" compresses multiple ideas). Figurative language sparse but potent ("fading like breath on glass"). Final line recharges "transience" motif cleanly without closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through ferry-worker specificity: "sand flowing sideways" visualizes fracture, "coffee in hand he didn’t remember" grounds restoration. Emotional truth in mundane heroism avoids abstraction. Fresh inflection: merging timelines as "weaving frayed ends into stronger whole" via deckhand’s lens.</comment>
