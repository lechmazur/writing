<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "serene anger" and embodied epiphany ("wove her own moment of crisis"), but "monstrous drum" heartbeat borders on bodily cliché without sufficient specificity to avoid Q1 anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly with felt cost ("profoundly useless"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ink's pattern dissolution, though minor causality drift in "desperate machinery of the mind" slightly softens the cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The disappearing ink functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("disappear into the pattern"), but "wind-carved encampment" lacks tangible constraint on choices despite vivid atmosphere, missing Q3's 9+ gate for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as ink patterns force realization, with visible cost in transformed anger, but the dominant stake ("why time slows") resolves too neatly into philosophical insight without deeper tactical consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ink patterns to "weaving extra seconds," avoiding moralizing; final image ("disappear into the pattern") delivers resonant, non-literal answer to time dilation's futility with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("pale eyes did not blink," "chemicals and ozone") creates distinct voice under pressure, though "monstrous drum" heartbeat momentarily drifts toward generic stress description in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with phrases like "frantic dance of creation and erasure," but "monstrous drum" heartbeat risks figurative muddle in high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding Q7's −0.3 overwriting penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation with disappearing ink patterns feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though albino trait leans slightly toward token uniqueness without deeper integration.</comment>
