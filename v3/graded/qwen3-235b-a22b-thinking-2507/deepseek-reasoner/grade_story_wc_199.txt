<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between order and chaos is embodied through micro-choices (monument-building vs frantic leaf-catching), but the epiphany lacks sufficient struggle; "profound and terrifying clarity" feels diagnostic rather than earned through visceral contradiction in the pivotal planting moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (sacrificing identity as sorter), but the moonstone's origin strains causality—it emerges coincidentally from monuments rather than prior character action, slightly undermining the Accumulative lens at the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workbench as micro-setting constrains the climax (planting into heartwood), and "mossy delight" ties environment to emotion; the transformed arbor's silver-gold veins directly charge the final image with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from decoding leaves to enacting prophecy, with the moonstone discovery narrowing options, but the folklore's role feels slightly convenient—Elara's agency in testing it lacks sufficient hesitation that would heighten the cost of her final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the final image of Elara using an "open hand" instead of her prod reconfigures the core concept without moralizing, making "the message was never in the falling, but in the planting" resonate as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in botanical precision ("dust of a thousand different pods"), but a single filter verb ("she saw they were not for the past") intrudes during high-pressure transformation, slightly dulling immediacy at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts; "fingers perpetually stained with dust" shows profession through texture. Minor synonym loop ("tiny, intricate monuments"/"tiny cairns") in Q7 deducts 0.1, but propulsion remains taut through the planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes via specific rituals (monuments as practice for light-seeding), but "ashen arbor" risks generic post-apocalyptic familiarity; saved by the fresh inversion where decoding becomes obsolete through embodied action.</comment>
