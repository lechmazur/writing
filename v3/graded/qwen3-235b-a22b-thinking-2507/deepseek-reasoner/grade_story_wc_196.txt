<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied in micro-choices (dust pattern analysis, button weight sensation); contradictory impulses—sorrow vs. hope—drive the closure's earned shift without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("heart no longer a monument to loss"); Accumulative lens holds through dust-pattern escalation; orientation anchored in 78 words with functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as micro-setting, constraining Silas’s investigation and charging the final image; file room’s tactile specificity ("brittle pages," "fading ink") shapes every choice with sensory urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connecting fragmented histories) tightens through dust-pattern discovery; marginal note escalates pressure via protagonist’s agency; cost legible in the heart’s transformation from loss to vessel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust/button motifs reweighted at closure; "magnifying small kindnesses" avoids moralizing by manifesting in Silas’s final action ("quiet prayer of gratitude") without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust topography," "tactfully hopeful diligence"); rhythmic control under pressure ("did not simply open it; with care, he began to unfurl"); zero head-hopping in single-POV lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("clean rectangle indicated something stored long ago") with visceral propulsion; figurative language ("fractured mosaic") serves character without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archivist trope transformed through dust-pattern method; specific verifiable detail (button size matching photo rectangle) creates freshness; risk-taking (textural escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
