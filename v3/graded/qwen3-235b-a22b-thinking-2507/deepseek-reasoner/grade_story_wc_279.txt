<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s socially perceptive nature drives micro-choices (reading sand as "worried lines"), but internal contradiction between order-seeking and accepting chaos needs sharper friction during the argument interruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the transformed lilac unease ("color of air before a dawn") reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sand mandala functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (precise pouring) and charges the final image; "hiss of sand" and tile’s coolness provide tactile specificity elevating closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency (tapping tile) narrows options from rigid truth-seeking to relational meaning; cost is visceral in the unease’s transformation without vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mandala’s interlocking lines, avoiding moralizing; the final line reweights "Unlearning" as hopeful inception without stated philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers stained with ghosts of rainbows") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in the tapping beat ("single, pure note") heightens tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("woven from lilac unease") propels momentum; final line’s "first line of a new drawing" recharges motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "emergent hush" as active force transforms conflict resolution tropes; risk-taking in quiet climax avoids gimmickry while deepening emotional truth.</comment>
