<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s transformation from collector to initiate feels earned through embodied micro-choices (thumb tracing fulgurite, ignoring cold), but Amos lacks secondary pressure; his late reveal as guardian diminishes relationship-as-crucible impact despite strong interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (mandala rope thrumming, fog lifting) reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost—the shift from preserving to weaving knowledge is legible and irreversible, though the Accumulative/Textural lens slightly obscures causal pressure in the knot-unfurling beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The golden dock under snow and fulgurite constrain choices (cold seeping through boots, glass humming against hemp) and charge the final image; "oceanic hush" evolves from setting to thematic vessel as fog lifts, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Escalation via density increase (knot patterns aligning with fulgurite) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, but the cost remains abstract; Amos’s late "Figured it out" weakens the felt price of Elara’s initiation despite strong conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (knots as "map of energy," fulgurite as "seed of knowledge"), avoiding moralizing; the final line "silence was no longer empty, but full of weaving" reweights the premise non-literally, though Amos’s dialogue borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("infinitely patient observation," salt-stiffened knots) and rhythmic control under pressure (short clauses during knot-unfurling) create voice cohesion; Amos’s sparse dialogue carries subtext without converging with Elara’s lyrical interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fragile, lightning-born root of sand" exemplifies textural specificity with propulsion. Minor register drift in "latent possibilities in all things" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate concrete action (thumb tracing knot).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "weaving fate" trope through scientific observation (fulgurite as captured lightning path), with emotional specificity in Elara’s patience-as-flaw. Risk-taking (knots as energy maps) heightens stakes but "secret weavers" concept leans slightly derivative.</comment>
