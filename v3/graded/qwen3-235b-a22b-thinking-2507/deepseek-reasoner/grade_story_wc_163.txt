<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in feather-induced panic versus firefly calm; embodied "breath came in short, sharp gasps" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of trauma’s hold is earned through witnessed fireflies, though micro-choices under pressure lack one concrete action altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "feather now just a relic, not a chain" reweights meaning with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density (feather→fireflies) tightens emotional options without coincidence. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; cost proof in her reinterpretation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ionized barrier and fireflies function as micro-settings constraining choice: the barrier enables observation, fireflies directly charge the final image. Sensory selection narrows during panic ("short, sharp gasps") then expands with wonder. No white-room syndrome—every detail serves emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging vs trauma) tightens via feather’s panic → fireflies’ respite. One meaningful deepening: passive observation becomes agency. Cost is visceral (chest tightening) and conceptual (feather reinterpreted). Escalation driven by protagonist’s attention under Accumulative lens; stakes never abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fireflies’ "luminous scripts" reweighting the feather’s meaning—no moralizing. Final image ("quiet heart alongside her own") offers resonant answer to belonging. Avoids sentimentality by grounding in concrete particulars; trauma/wonder coexistence feels earned without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "shadowseam wonder," "negative image of night sky" reflect her astrologer lens. Rhythm compresses under stress ("breath came in short, sharp gasps"), expands with fireflies. Zero filter verbs; diction stays within her plausible lexicon even at peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—every sentence multiplies meaning ("lazy, luminous scripts against the void"). Figurative language sparse but potent; final line crystallizes closure without muddle. Paragraph cuts vary rhythm: short staccato during panic, flowing cadence with fireflies. Exceptional propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Landscape astrologer" transforms trauma tropes through underwater specificity. Fireflies as pressure catalyst feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Emotional truth avoids templates—belonging found in passive witness, not action. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; proximity check passes.</comment>
