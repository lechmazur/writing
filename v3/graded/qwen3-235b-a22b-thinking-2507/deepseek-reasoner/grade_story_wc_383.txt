<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs embodied trauma) drive micro-choices under pressure, but "raw truth of trauma" veers toward abstract interiority during climax, slightly undermining embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the sigh of gratitude and lighter garden crystallize the memory’s transformation, though harmonic resolution risks slight convenience despite resonance foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shell as micro-setting constrains choices (tuning fork trials) and charges closure (dark inert shell), but the velvet garden remains atmospheric backdrop without actively pressuring tactics despite starlight enabling the work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through failed harmonic attempts ("brush with despair"), tightening options to the F-sharp breakthrough; cost is legible in Elara’s exhaustion and emotional toll, though single-stake focus limits depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "archiving" reweights trauma into peace without moralizing; final image ("garden felt lighter") delivers non-literal answer to isolation’s resolution, avoiding all anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (restorer’s lexicon: "resonance structures," "solvents") modulates rhythm under pressure; "ghostly resolve" slightly abstracts state but overall maintains concrete focalization through sensory shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt-sting of fear" exemplifies embodied specificity. Minor deduction: "she understood now" leans toward telling where showing her hands trembling would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through restorer’s lens—"archiving memory" reframes exorcism as conservation. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off, though "charmed skeptic" setup edges near familiar territory despite deep integration.</comment>
