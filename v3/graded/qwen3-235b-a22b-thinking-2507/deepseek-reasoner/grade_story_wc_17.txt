<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied perception ("fingers tracing charred edges") and micro-choice to press ear to paneling reveal contradictory impulses (professional duty vs inherited burden). Final endurance of legacy's cost is earned through acoustic expertise, though Lysander's off-page presence limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "carefully placed the negative... to share" crystallizes conceptual cost of legacy with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors within 100 words; causal escalation (diary clues → acoustic search → discovery) narrows options cleanly under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage actively constrains choices: dappled light enables diary reading, acoustic properties ("sighing corner") directly enable discovery. Final image of negative held to green light charges setting with thematic weight, avoiding postcard description through functional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency: diary reading shifts motivation from mapping to legacy recovery, acoustic search narrows options to physical investigation. Cost ("burden settled onto her shoulders") visibly alters tactics, though climate shifts remain atmospheric rather than tightening clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "walls dream" motif resolved by ghostly family images woven into architecture. Final image reweights legacy as both burden and gift without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through earned resonance in the negative's revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sound-focused diction ("whisper of breeze trapped in stone"); syntax compresses under pressure ("She had to find the negative"). Zero POV leaks, with rhythmic control heightening acoustic discovery beats while maintaining consistent focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "relentless green" shows textural specificity. Every sentence advances plot/character, with final line avoiding sentimentality through concrete action. Minor deduction: "legacy's burden" slightly tells before showing in diaries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "found document" trope through acoustic lens; "corridor echo cartographer" is fresh occupational detail that matters. Emotional truth in inheriting obsession avoids derivative climate fiction, though timeframe integration lacks pressure.</comment>
