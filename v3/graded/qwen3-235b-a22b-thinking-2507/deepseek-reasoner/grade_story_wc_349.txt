<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias' motivation to trace narratives to origin mirrors visitor's quest organically; embodied contradiction in "precisely disordered" workspace reveals values. Her tear transforming glass shows earned emotional progression without labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: request → method → discovery → transformation. Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options when tear fills void with light, making conceptual cost undeniable through parole shift from "glimmer to dawn".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass orchard walls constrain choices (panes as tools), bottled moonlight illuminates critical absences, and mindfully scattered fragments directly enable cross-referencing breakthrough. Final light-image charges closure through prior specifics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (her existence) tightens through Elias' method: quantifying absences narrows to "forgiveness not granted" origin. Agency-driven escalation culminates in visible cost—tear transforming parole—but method explanation slightly tell-y in middle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete voids: "stories begin with lost choice" reweights premise via tear's light. Final image rejects tidy morals, showing conceptual cost without stated moral. No thematic echo; wisdom earned through fragmented panes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "dust motes in bottled moonlight," not weather. Rhythmic control under pressure ("mindfully scattered," "integrated fragmentation") taught early. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts with discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("liquid silver" text flow, "glimmer to dawn" parole shift). Propulsion through strong verbs ("incise," "peeling back"). Final line’s "choice in the heart" recharges bottled moonlight without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "story origin" trope through negative-space narrative method. Emotional truth in ghost’s tear-light transformation feels inevitable. Risk-taking (absence quantification) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
