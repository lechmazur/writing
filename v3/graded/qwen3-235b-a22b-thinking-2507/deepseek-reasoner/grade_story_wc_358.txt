<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through "hazy precision" method and micro-choices adapting to wind pockets; embodied emotion in "fabric rough between fingers" avoids labels. Lacks secondary character pressure since dock manager is inert, limiting relationship crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("natural quiet waiting to be filled") with undeniable cost in "teeth ache" vibration. Causal lens holds perfectly: wind data → convergence point → engine discovery → power disconnection. No orientation debt; cost proof evident in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container maze functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (navigating acoustic eddies) and charges final image (resonant chamber). "Rust-colored canyon" sensory detail reflects investigator's precision. Maritime specificity slightly underutilized beyond visual texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: wind mapping reveals convergence point, forcing Elias toward epicenter. Cost is visceral (teeth vibration) and conceptual (town's suspended state). Agency-driven escalation; coincidence (patch) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "foresight in action" motivation becoming tangible act (ripping power coupling). Final image reweights silence without moralizing. Slightly undercut by "bitter coincidence" over-explaining patch's meaning near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: investigator's wind-focused observations ("micro-currents," "dead zones") shape all description. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("air vibrated with pressure that made his teeth ache"). No head-hopping; elision of backstory taught via manifest reference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "woolen quiet" exemplifies high-density imagery. "Chaotic symphony of pressure" slightly overwrites but payoff justifies. Final line achieves poetic precision without muddling causality. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of infrasound physics with container acoustics. Emotional specificity in "frozen mid-task" citizens avoids disaster tropes. Derivative guardrail passed: transforms "silent town" trope through investigator's methodical lens and tangible wind mechanics.</comment>
