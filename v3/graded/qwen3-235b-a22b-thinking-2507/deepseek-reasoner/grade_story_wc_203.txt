<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("discover what ceilings hide") deepens under pressure with embodied contradictions: Leo’s duty clashes with the "weightless burden" of ghostly stories. Micro-choices (probing plaster, inserting mainspring) reveal hierarchy of values. Ghost’s anxiety-to-peace arc avoids stock tropes through tactile specificity (palm on dust-free sill).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: ghost’s fading into "profound peace" carries undeniable conceptual cost (erasure of her existence as resolution). Causal lens holds throughout—dust clue → compartment → mainspring insertion—narrowing options meaningfully. Cost proof crystallized in "she simply faded" with palpable emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice (triggers ghost’s appearance) and charges the final image (her palm on the dust-free sill). Sensory details ("dust soft as powdered sugar," "chill permeated") serve urgency, not ornament. Recurring object (sill) directly shapes the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resolving the ghost’s secret to lift Leo’s burden) tightens decisively when the mainspring is inserted, foreclosing unrest with visible cost (ghost’s dissolution). Agency drives escalation: Leo’s choices narrow options under causal lens. Cost is unmistakable in the "profound peace" that replaces anxiety, reweighting the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "truths pressed flat between floors" resolves through the mainspring’s reinsertion, not moralizing. Final image (ghost fading after the chime) offers resonant non-literal answer to "what ceilings hide," reweighting prior material without abstraction. Avoids thematic echo despite near-miss with "weightless burden" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("technician’s eye" noticing dust patterns, hairline fractures) modulates under pressure with rhythmic control ("chill permeated," "delicate click"). Voice stays within Leo’s plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Minor register drift in "horologist’s mainspring barrel" forgiven by occupational authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero text artifacts: prose accelerates during climax ("delicate click and hum") without figurative muddle. High density ("dust, soft as powdered sugar" conveys decay and texture). Final line ("weightless burden lifted") crystallizes closure with precision. No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and technician precision: emotional truth in "weightless burden" avoids trope clichés. Specificity (mainspring’s celestial engravings, dust analysis) transforms familiar material. Risk-taking (quiet Earned Stasis closure) heightens stakes coherently, making the resolution feel inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
