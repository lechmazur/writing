<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's armor cracking via "How?" earns change through embodied contradiction (defiance vs whisper), but "fear. The anger." borders on label-only emotion without sufficient physical manifestation in that beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Leo's silent step toward listening forecloses his defensive stance with visible cost ("resignation thinning"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through resonant reconfiguration of the rosette's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The zither rosette constrains choice (muting strings to find harmony) and charges the final image (glinting light), meeting 9+ gate by transforming from decoration to "silent promise" that shapes the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Anya's demonstration—noise to harmony—driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; Leo's whispered "How?" crystallizes the trade-off (defiance for vulnerability) with palpable cost in his softened stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rosette's evolving resonance: "brave delicate work of balancing difference" avoids moralizing by showing harmony as active subtraction, with final image reweighting chaos as potential without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anya's "aged paper" voice vs Leo's "discord" thrum creates distinct perceptual signatures, though "seemed to soften" introduces minor filter-verb drift in a high-pressure beat that dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" repetition creates a subtle synonym loop in the final paragraph, slightly muddying the closure image despite otherwise precise rhythm and zero scaffolding in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical physics as emotional framework avoids cliché; risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through the rosette's charged specificity, though "vanishing arts" premise leans slightly familiar without deeper transformation.</comment>
