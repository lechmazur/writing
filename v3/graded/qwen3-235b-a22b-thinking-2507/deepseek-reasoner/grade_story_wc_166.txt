<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between grief as anchor and liberation through art is embodied in the tattooing process; "spontaneously anchored" trait lacks active demonstration of tradeoffs despite strong motivation. Final renunciation of exile via self-made cosmos earns closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the "punctuation mark of pain" and permanent ink embody the stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase in the final constellation ignition reweights the nostalgia ban’s oppression into transcendence without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The body as micro-setting constrains every choice: moonstone pigment’s luminescence charges the final image, and the twilight garden’s silver-leafed plants actively enable the forbidden act. "Silver-leafed plants" and "mist sea" aren’t backdrop but tactile resources shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the tattooing process under Accumulative lens—each star’s placement narrows Elara’s options until the final "seven-pointed marvel" forces irreversible commitment. Cost is visceral: the "prick" as "star being born" makes sacrifice tangible without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: the cosmic verse reweights the nostalgia ban’s oppression into a "portable eternity." Final image ("past mapped onto her") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding false balance by centering embodied resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tide dancer’s precision ("dance remembered") and sensory selectivity ("scent of night-blooming jasmine") modulate under pressure. Syntax tightens during tattooing ("first prick was punctuation mark"), teaching the lyric pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "obsidian grace" motif evolves from sharp severance to luminous reflection without muddle. Final line’s "perfect, private cosmos" achieves maximum density—no figurative clutter despite poetic intensity, with rhythm varying to match emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through specific, grounded choices: tide dancer’s art becomes skin-mapping, moonstone dust as pigment. Emotional truth in "grief as anchor then lift" avoids generic rebellion; "portable eternity" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
