<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is vivid but protagonist lacks interior contradiction; "rosewater dread" tells rather than embodies emotion. Micro-choices under pressure absent during hive retrieval climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (tasting names = cultural reclamation). Orientation delayed past 120 words but disorientation pays off in waterfall/silence motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cold dampness and honeycomb wax constrain choices—molding initials physically reshapes cultural transmission. Final fire-lit faces charged by recurring tactile specificity (raw fingers, melting wax).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultural starvation) tightens via honeycomb revelation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara drives all key turns. Cost legible in "fragile letters" melting, yet external pressure (hive discovery) feels coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through honeycomb language rebirth; final hum replaces silence without moralizing. Avoids "rosewater dread" sentimentality by fusing sorrow with tangible wax letters. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("verdant hue," "cloying sorrow") persists under stress. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstraction. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via waterfall/silence motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cloying, sentimental sorrow" slightly overwrought but pays off in final dread fusion. Strategic telling compresses journey. Final line’s "taste it" crystallizes motif without scaffold. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bees encoding language via instinct transforms displacement trope. Bold risk in Accumulative structure, but hive discovery lacks groundwork. "Thaw" motif avoids cliché through literal wax melting. Transformation test passed.</comment>
