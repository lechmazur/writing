<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (oblivious guilt vs conscious effort) embodied through ticket doodles and lens use; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values when placing ticket on Leo's knee without words. Brother's thawing reaction lacks sufficient prior friction to fully earn the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost in "transparent artifact of her regret" and final bridge metaphor; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern recognition (doodles→hornet). Late realization risks feeling convenient without deeper middle-beat struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal sculptures and rain constrain choice (water droplets as natural lenses mirroring projector lens); recurring lens object charges final image. Micro-setting functions as pressure when puddles reflect Leo's hesitation pre-revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (mistrust thawing) tighten through doodle revelation with felt cost of vulnerability; pressure escalates via Accumulative lens. Brother's emotional shift occurs too abruptly in final beat without sufficient middle-beat resistance to test commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of transparency emerges through lens/doodle mechanics; final bridge image reweights "wall" metaphor without moralizing. Slightly over-literal "freed by her honesty" risks thematic echo though offset by tangible evidence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tiny lens distorting the world") with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; no head-hopping. Minor register drift when "resonant hush" repeats without modulation during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "cryptic doodles in margins" doing triple duty (character/theme/plot). Final image's "silence... no longer a wall" slightly over-explains the earned Charge Poise, nudging toward tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work and emotional archaeology; crystal forecourt transforms generic rain trope. Risk-taking (textural lens over causal) heightens stakes but brother's instant thaw lacks the non-obvious moral calculus for 9.0.</comment>
