<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (e.g., flute raised to calm shadow, not fight it), with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats required for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("silence felt different now"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Midpoint lens ambiguity nearly triggered penalty, but closure's density shift reweights silence with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon silence functions as active micro-setting, constraining method (single-note resonance) and charging final image. "Avalanchingly quiet" pressure shapes every tactical choice, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through shadow confrontation, with cost legible in altered silence. Escalation slightly passive as shadow attack feels coincidental, though protagonist's keeper response aligns with arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from archival observation ("stewardship vs ownership"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "canyon's endless hush" as non-literal answer to central question, satisfying 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("geological" metaphors, tactile verbs) sustains under pressure. "Reverence that bordered on fear" edges toward abstraction, preventing 9+ despite rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "ghostly projections" and "sorrowful pantomime" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat. Final line achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "weaving" as resonance ritual transforms tropes. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry, though "guardianship" framework lacks sufficient novelty for 9.5+.</comment>
