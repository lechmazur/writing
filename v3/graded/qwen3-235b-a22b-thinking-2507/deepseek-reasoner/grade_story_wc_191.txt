<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority stays abstract; "desperate need to act" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. Final throne rejection earns Earned Stasis, but bodily clichés like "heart a drum" undermine embodied emotion during critical moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: murals' sedimentary history builds density toward Charged Poise closure. Sunrise deadline anchors orientation early, but "urgency remained" lacks visible tactical tightening during climb, missing one escalation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ruby flake constrains choices (pried loose to open vortex) and charges final image (dissolving into signal flare). "Geometric fruit" lacks specificity, but cybernetic blossoms directly feed the orchard's decay motif that underpins the throne's obsolescence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find stairway before sunrise) signaled early, but sunrise pressure evaporates after step-through. Accumulative escalation via mural history reweights legacy cost, yet "urgency remained" stays abstract without altering climb tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of speaking "not with futuristic nostalgia... but with wisely adventurous hope" offers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids moralizing; throne's purpose shift ("would wait forever, its purpose served") reweights legacy through action, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "light-particles parted like a curtain" and "hum a low, lonely frequency." Minor flaw: "heart a drum" cliché breaks voice consistency under peak stress during step-through.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-loop in "scraping through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals. Each layer told..." weakens propulsion. Otherwise clean rhythm, but "very orchard he stood in" contains scaffolding ("very") that dilutes density in high-pressure discovery beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms throne trope into legacy test and ascension into memory journey. "Unclaimed throne" specificity elevates cliché, but "kaleidoscopic waterfall" edges toward generic cyber-fantasy without fresh inflection.</comment>
