<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of oblivion vs. desire for connection) act simultaneously in the attic climax; her earned renunciation of "borrowed-time" mindset carries visible cost as "frantic counting of days ceased." Epiphany avoids diagnostic labels through embodied shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: density increase (urn fragment → phantom year → attic revelation) reweights mortality stake with legible cost in "frantic counting ceased." Lens established by midpoint with "phantom year" setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emerald silo and urn fragment function as micro-setting charging closure; the fragment's transformation from "key" to "promise between keepers" constrains her final stance. Sensory details like "dust of decayed ambitions" reflect urgency without checklist overload.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency (embedding messages → attic discovery) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, narrowing options as phantom year's truth reconfigures mortality. Cost unmistakable in her cessation of day-counting, foreclosing scarcity mindset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: final image ("texture richer than she had ever dreamed") reweights time's meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (garage sale tags as "casting a net") and silence (Alistair's hidden diaries).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust of decayed ambitions," tactile time focus) and rhythmic control evident in compression during stress ("Weeks passed, silence broken only by rustle of paper"). Minor filter verbs acceptable for introspective voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "fragment felt like a key, but to a lock she couldn't see" advance plot and character simultaneously. Final line recharges "texture" motif with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms terminal illness trope through specific historical mystery (phantom year, 1972b tags). Emotional truth in shift from scarcity to abundance mindset avoids generic templates; "borrowed-time timekeeper" reframing feels inevitable.</comment>
