<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the climax ("urge to burn... rose like magma") with embodied cost; micro-choices (prying slab, weaving coordinates) reveal value hierarchy without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visceral cost: "urge to burn... rose like magma" versus leaving the tapestry, foreclosing isolation with vulnerability; causal lens holds through precise escalation from burning to public revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting object charging the final image; "smelling of dust and time" and "petrified wood" constrain choices while avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: controlled fire enables archive access, weaving coordinates forces stance crystallization; cost (vulnerability of public trust) legible in "volcano of hope and fear" before the child's discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (coordinates revealed through weaving) offers resonant answer to knowledge hoarding without moralizing; theme emerges from Kythian art method, avoiding thematic echo in the girl's silent understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("volcanic tenderness," "vandalized self-portrait") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("hands a blur") with taught elision (burning as method) enhancing immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high-density propulsion ("surgical, controlled rage" compresses motive/action); final image ("scars part of a beautiful picture") crystallizes cost without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist-as-archivist transforms library trope through Kythian woven history; risk-taking (artistic clues) heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing transformation test.</comment>
