<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction under pressure lacks development; pivotal kneeling choice feels resolved without wrestling conflicting impulses (e.g., fear vs. hope).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: catacomb purpose unclear until 150+ words; closure (tarot crumbling as debt paid) lands cleanly under Accumulative lens but late anchor caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices actively: roots tightening as opposition, tibia cracks as ritual surfaces; final golden light recharges ash/decay imagery with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes clear but escalation passive; entity pressure (shifting roots) doesn't force tactical adaptation—Elara executes predetermined ritual without visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (quartz in bones, leaf on clavicle); final golden light reconfigures "dusky resolve" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice falters under pressure: "fiercely gentle" told not shown; filter-verb stacks ("she could feel") dilute immediacy during entity confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "inlaying meaning everywhere" repeated verbatim; otherwise vivid propulsion with zero artifacts near closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "bargain with death" trope via bone-ritual specificity; "catacomb orchard" avoids graveyard clichés but resolution leans familiar for high-band.</comment>
