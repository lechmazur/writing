<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("writer of lies" vs. unable to fabricate comfort) embodied through shell-worrying and theft shame; final choice to "live quiet hopes" earned by bedside memory's command with visible cost in "fragile, and true." No diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: shell-casting crystallizes stance shift with conceptual cost ("fragile, and true, and it was enough") under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens via accumulating hope-shapes until bedside immersion forces crystallization. Cost legible in final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Feral nexus setting actively constrains choice—tide direction dictates path, mist enables seeing hope-shapes. Shell fragment (micro-setting) charges final image: "fossil of a past hope" cast into tide reweights meaning from memory token to offering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cynicism vs. living quiet hopes) tightens through witnessed hope-shapes (boy's fish, woman's letter) to bedside command. Elias's agency in casting shell narrows options with felt cost—sacrificing writerly persona for fragile authenticity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "warm sun, risen bread" reprises Clara's dialogue as lived action, not stated moral. Final image reweights "quiet hopes" as active endurance with conceptual cost—no thematic echo, only resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "lucidly watchful" manifests in crab/gull details filtered through grief. Rhythm modulates under pressure—bedside memory compresses syntax ("whisper of closing pages"). Zero head-hopping; free indirect style clean in "shame... cold stone."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "fossil of a past hope" does triple duty (history/emotion/theme). Figurative language sparse but potent ("shame... cold stone") in peak beats. Final line’s cadence ("fragile, and true, and it was enough") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via specific synthesis: "hopes as tangible shapes" grounded in bluish glow/boy's fish. "Against the current" motif operates literally (tide), thematically (cynicism), and causally (path choice). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
