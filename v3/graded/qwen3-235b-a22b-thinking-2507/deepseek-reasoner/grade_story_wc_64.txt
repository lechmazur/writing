<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—her transition from grief to hope feels seamless without embodied struggle in the decoding process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the "plush, quiet beginning of everything" reconfigures the velveteen gloom with undeniable conceptual cost, fulfilling the Accumulative/Textural lens through density and pattern shift without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and sovereign case constrain choices (thread-pulling triggers clicks), while the "velveteen gloom" evolves from ending to beginning, charging the final image—but the tapestry's physicality lacks sufficient tactile integration during decoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency (decoding thread → case clicks), narrowing options to active resurrection; the cost—reinterpreting her tools' purpose—is legible but could deepen the emotional toll of discarding grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "not a memorial but a seed vault" avoids moralizing, yet "profound hope" risks abstraction; the shears' repurposing as "resurrection" tools delivers earned resonance without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized blooms"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; minor register drift in "genetic memory" slightly disrupts voice coherence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, but "tenderly organized" repeats identically early on; high density falters with "dense, intricate knot" (redundant modifiers), though final image avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery tropes through "tapestry border as genetic key," with fresh synthesis in tools-as-resurrection; risks lyrical compression without gimmickry, though sovereign case borders on familiar "mystery box" archetypes.</comment>
