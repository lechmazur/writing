<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in designer's spatial mind versus temporal paralysis, but "retrocognitively trapped" label breaks embodied emotion. Micro-choices limited by physical stasis weaken agency under pressure despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (dimmed fragment), but hyperbolic geometry solution lacks setup, creating causality drift in Accumulative lens. Final image reconfigures stakes effectively despite weak escalation logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Living Bridge Garden constrains every choice—pulsing moss, dissolving photographs, and the fragment's interaction charge the final image. Micro-setting (halo fragment) shapes the escape mechanics with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory decay (fading photos), but protagonist's paralysis limits agency-driven escalation. Cost (fragment's power) is visible, yet the solution's sudden geometric certainty undermines pressure coherence in Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "texture of time" motif reweighted by final image ("smooth, curved, and infinitely fragile"), avoiding moralizing. Photographs' dissolution crystallizes memory's duality without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cartographer of spaces") modulates rhythm from lyrical to urgent ("air began to hum... quaking reverie"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure's sensory precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with "luminous, geometric dust" avoiding purple prose, but adjacent paraphrase ("flickered, their subjects pausing in their decay") triggers minor scaffold penalty. Closure image remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope through maze-designer lens and hyperbolic geometry, but solution's late introduction feels unearned. Emotional specificity in "suffocating grain of old film" elevates beyond novelty.</comment>
