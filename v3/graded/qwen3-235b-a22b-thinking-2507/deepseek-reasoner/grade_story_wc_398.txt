<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradiction (vineyard knowledge vs. emotional vulnerability) shines, but Leo’s motivation relies on exposition; “intersubjective understanding” risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (“not, after all, alone”), but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) wavers slightly when thematic resonance edges toward overt metaphor in the final vineyard lesson.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vineyard’s grafting metaphor actively constrains choices and charges the final image—thriving “mismatched vines” reconfigure the meaning of loss, elevating setting beyond atmosphere to thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara’s agency (drawing parallels), but escalation lacks one visible price paid *during* the search; Leo’s confession feels slightly unearned without prior pressure on his shadowed eyes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by embedding theme in vineyard logic, though “lessons they teach the soil” risks thematic echo; the final image’s unspoken truth resonates without stating the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“cork sealing her into vintage autumn air”) and rhythmic control under pressure, but elevated diction (“intersubjective understanding”) briefly clashes with sentinel POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts, but minor scaffold appears (“a physical presence, a deep and settling dust”); metaphor density stays purposeful, though “burned love letter edge curled like a blackened petal” borders on overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms “impossible love” through vineyard-specific grafting logic; the synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (quiet closure) heightening emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
