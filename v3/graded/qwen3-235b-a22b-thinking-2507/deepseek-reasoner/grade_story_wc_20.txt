<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "intention not to mourn, but to redeem" driving micro-choices; embodied emotion via tear-to-gold transformation avoids therapy-speak; single flaw: "balanced alchemist" trait lacks concrete professional constraint on actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "regret remained, but edges lined with luminous understanding"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through sensory density buildup to the coin's vision; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry functions as micro-setting: dripping water times emotional beats, wet ash/cold iron constrain alchemical method; the zodiac coin (tool) directly charges final image through golden tracery reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("understand weight of names") tightens through coin's transformation; agency-driven deepening when Elara's whisper shifts from metallurgy to mystical songs; cost legible in "regret remained" reframing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "weight of names" motif: Kael's "Guardian" transformation reweights "fool" label without moralizing; final walk "into clean, rain-washed air" offers resonant non-literal answer to naming's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "factual bones of her world" layered with "mystical prayers"; rhythmic control peaks in "each drip from the broken roof ringing like a bell" compression; no POV slippage despite reflective backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "golden tracery bloomed like a vein" exemplifies high-density fusion of concrete action and thematic weight; final line "profound weight carried by a single, true name" avoids abstraction through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alchemy tropes transformed via "factually mystical" lens and naming's emotional physics; "kintsugi intentions" reframes grief as active mending; specificity of "zodiac coin stamped Scales" prevents derivative feel.</comment>
