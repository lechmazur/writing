<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander's "spark of defiance" motivation manifests in concrete micro-choices (offering lavender to Auditors while destroying patterns), though "fierce motivation" summary slightly flattens interiority. Contradictory impulses—preserving code versus saving comrades—crystallize credibly in the warping act, with chlorophyll-stained hands embodying cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with undeniable cost: imprisonment juxtaposed against chaotic gardens multiplying his defiance. Causal chain holds perfectly—Auditors tracing patterns forces warping, which directly causes the signal-loss victory. The drone's "angry heart" pulse crystallizes the before/after legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (rattle seed enabling encoding), charging the final cricket song. However, community gardens aren't anchored early enough as tactical terrain—first mentioned vaguely as "the gardens"—delaying environmental constraint on stakes until mid-story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Lysander's agency: his encoded gardens attract scanners, forcing the warping choice that forecloses his original method. Cost is visceral (imprisonment) and conceptual (signal lost in noise), with "chlorophyll-stained hands" making the price legible as he offers crushed lavender to his captors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "they could tax a thought, but not a field of blooming flowers" avoids moralizing. The final cricket song reweights the premise with conceptual cost—defiance persists as "roots pushing through concrete"—offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mind, a vibrant garden of unregistered ideas") and rhythmic control shine under pressure: frantic short sentences during the warping sequence contrast with lyrical prison reflections. Voice modulates perfectly from scholarly charm to desperate action without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "spectral green light merged with red blink" compressing atmosphere. Minor density issue: "vibrant garden of unregistered ideas" slightly strains metaphor in opening, but peak beats ("sustained, furious rhythm") avoid figurative muddle while propelling action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms thought-control tropes through specific horticultural coding (basil=danger) and emotional truth in "prison cell as another garden." Risk-taking (using gardening as resistance) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the chlorophyll-stained hands detail grounds universals in verifiable freshness.</comment>
