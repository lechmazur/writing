<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. share memory) manifest physically in trembling hands breaking the vial seal; embodied grief avoids therapy-speak with "sob, ragged and unexpected" showing wistfulness as active vulnerability rather than passive trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: Elara's vial-breaking forecloses preservation path, her tears reweighted as "shared understanding" under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legible in "last drops of a lost world gleaming" amid withering bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting charges final image: "crystal shadows" constrain Elara's "aromatically cautious" movement early, then frame the vial's gleam at closure where environment directly enables the emotional exchange with Kaelen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens when scent cascade hits—narrowing options to endure grief or break preservation ritual; agency shown in deliberate vial-handing (not smelling it), with cost crystallized in "tears no longer solely of sorrow" as bloom fades.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of shared vial reweights "why smells trigger tears" as communal preservation without moralizing; Kaelen's "you see?" avoids thematic echo, while scent's physical evaporation makes conceptual cost undeniable in "last drops of a lost world."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through scent/light filters ("air itself was a library of forgotten scents"); compression intensifies under stress with "sob, ragged and unexpected" avoiding uniform emotional calibration while maintaining wistful voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax: "reached... broke... held out... said" sequence drives propulsion with high density; "ghostly lace" metaphor serves setting without muddle, final line's "fleeting scent" charging closure through concrete action not abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes science/memories through lantern broker profession—ultraviolet revealing as emotional conduit transforms grief tropes; risk-taking (hiring for wistfulness not skill) heightens stakes while maintaining coherence in "soul weeps" payoff.</comment>
