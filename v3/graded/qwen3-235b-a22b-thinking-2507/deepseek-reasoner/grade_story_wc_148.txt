<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in choosing truth over "crying wolf" despite fearing disbelief, with embodied cost in the lattice's heat. Final renunciation of inherited lies earns closure through prior causality, but warden's backstory remains underexplored as a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: truth spoken into lattice dissolves the entity with undeniable cost ("before they find the bodies"). Hybrid lens (Accumulative-to-Causal) holds through storm escalation to climax, though lattice's containment function feels slightly retroactive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison actively constrains choices (glass cage, jagged reef) and charges the final image ("cold stone"). The lattice as micro-setting shapes the climax, with copperlight evolving from atmospheric detail to narrative device that reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (truth vs. lies for survival) tightens through protagonist agency: speaking truth forecloses deception with visible cost. Escalation driven by his choice ("could not cry wolf") makes the resupply boat's arrival an unmistakable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "threading the labyrinth with your own story," resolving in the lattice holding his truth without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise with conceptual cost, though "sin I did not commit" slightly oversimplifies moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dead eye of the lens watched me with dusty indifference") and rhythmic control under pressure shine. Voice modulates perfectly from lyrical ("copperlight repose") to urgent ("I spoke my truth"), with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or plot with crystalline propulsion. "Shimmering, malevolent distortion" avoids purple prose through concrete verbs, and the final line recharges motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cry wolf" trope through lighthouse prison specificity and truth-as-weapon mechanism. Emotional truth in "son of a liar" dilemma feels fresh, with risk-taking in Accumulative-to-Causal shift heightening stakes cohesively.</comment>
