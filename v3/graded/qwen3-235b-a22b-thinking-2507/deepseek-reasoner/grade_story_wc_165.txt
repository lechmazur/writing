<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak (Eli's "calculated wilderness" concept lacks embodied struggle); woman's motivation underdeveloped despite strong micro-choices like refusing queen capture. "Quiet fatigue" borders on label-only feeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—bishop placement reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (abandoned checkmate for harmony). But lens ambiguity early ("orchestrated serendipity" undefined until para 4) caps near 9.0 despite flawless cost legibility in final note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chessboard-as-instrument is indispensable micro-setting: constrains choices (each move = sound), charges final image (twin bishops' harmony). Sodium-vapor light and tidal detritus weave atmosphere without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via queen sacrifice deepens stakes (artistic control vs. human connection), but dominant stake ("serenade monotony") lacks sufficient friction until climax. One tightening suffices for length, yet cost feels slightly abstract despite palpable musical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from chess/music duality—final harmony answers "chaos vs. order" without moralizing. But "calculated wilderness" phrasing risks thematic echo; saved by concrete payoff (bishop duet over checkmate).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sonic representation of crashing waves," "salt-tinged air") modulates with tension. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("silent dance that screamed with sound"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via tidal patterns metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("dissonant, shimmering chord echoed, making them both smile" does triple duty). Minor register drift in "necessary variable" (academic term) barely dulls climax but avoids penalty. Final line’s resonance flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms chess trope via tactile specificity (yellowed bishop, cello hum for rook). Risk-taking (sacrificing queen for human connection) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: checkmate forgotten for harmonic fifth interval.</comment>
