<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (observer vs participant) act simultaneously when the thread shifts her craft; Isolde's embodied grief avoids therapy-speak as she traces the carpet's ocean. Final choice to write of "woven integration" earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Elara's entire professional framework transforms when the thread makes absence a "connection." The "crimson thread" plucking beat creates visible pressure shift under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The carpet thread constrains choice (Isolde plucks it) and charges the final image as "tiny compass." Dust motes becoming "sawdust" reweights setting through active perception, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency when she projects presence onto the carpet, narrowing her options from chronicler to participant. Cost is visceral in the sensory flood that reconfigures her life's work with felt conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the carpet's "necessary tension" without moralizing. Final image of the thread as "compass" reweights "lonesome splendor" into resonant answer: healing isn't moving beyond grief but weaving loss into life's fabric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's "geography of healing" lens colors all observation. Isolde's "dry leaves skittering" voice contrasts perfectly with Elara's internal texture. Rhythmic control peaks in the sensory flood paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thin, gold veneer over deepening blue shadows" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-duplicate of "lonesome splendor" (opening vs garden exit) prevents 10.0 but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through weaving metaphor: Isolde wearing loss "not as a scar but as a presence" avoids cliché. Emotional specificity in the carpet thread's warmth creates freshness without quirks.</comment>
