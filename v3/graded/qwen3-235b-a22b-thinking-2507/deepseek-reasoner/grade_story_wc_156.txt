<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "methodically playful" approach versus professional caution; final choice to complete (not repair) fracture earns visible cost of surrendered certainty. Slight abstraction in "perpetually motivated" phrasing prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("exchanging certainty... for boundless curiosity") under Accumulative lens. Vision mechanics stretch causality slightly but payoff in creator's fracture design justifies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices (silent work until activation) and charges final image—the lotus symphony. Brass sculptures supply essential resources; only "physical thing" cliché prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from historical curiosity to legacy responsibility via creator's vision. Agency crystallizes in Elara's tap completing the fracture, reweighting "certainty vs. curiosity" with visible identity cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic alchemy: curiosity as rebellion against silencing. Final image reweights "certainty" without moralizing; soldiers' subversion fear adds complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (noticing sonic textures, material fragility); rhythm modulates under pressure ("a chord from a petal, a melody from a leaf"). One elevated phrase ("ghost in the machine") slightly jars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("shuddered," "vibrating"). Figurative language precise ("note hung like liquid jewel"). Minor repetition of "methodically playful" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes restoration tropes through sonic mechanics and professional specificity. "Nested awakenings" concept transforms stakes organically; risk in vision-within-activation heightens legacy cost without gimmickry.</comment>
