<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; "quiet internal scream" remains abstract label without embodied struggle against courtesan conditioning. Micro-choice of plucking threads shows agency, but epiphany feels tidily earned without visible moral ambiguity in her role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words (-0.4 penalty) limits score despite strong Charged Poise closure. Final image of "unperformed expression" reconfigures conformity with conceptual cost (weight of hidden sighs), but courtyard anchoring arrives too late for seamless immersion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Snow transforms from setting to "blank verse" that actively constrains choice—each flake as syllable forces poetic embodiment. Final image of cupped light charges closure by making suppressed humanity tactile, satisfying 9+ gate via micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: conformity shifts from lullaby to cage as harvested echoes intensify pressure. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the sanctuary's "threatening" vibration feels externally imposed rather than earned through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystalline echoes (crimson kiss, azure promise), avoiding moralizing until the mid-scene "cage/key" line—nearly triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Final image of blazing thread reweights conformity through visceral resonance, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bodily poetic" framing) sustains voice through high-pressure beats. Rhythmic control shines in "sigh and smile" transitions, though minor register drift occurs when "prism sanctuary" shifts to clinical terminology mid-vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop with "alarming serenity" (lines 8/25) and overwriting in "vortex of pure, unfiltered experience" dull closure impact. Otherwise exceptional density: "crimson echo of a first kiss" compresses theme, character, and setting into one charged phrase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan-as-observer harvesting emotional echoes avoids trope clichés. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through snow’s evolving role, though "chaste courtesan" premise risks safety-hedging by omitting moral tension in her profession.</comment>
