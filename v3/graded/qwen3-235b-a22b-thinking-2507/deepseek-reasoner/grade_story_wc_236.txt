<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grieving loss vs. seeking new path) manifest in embodied micro-choices; the tear's "not of sadness, but of profound understanding" avoids therapy-speak while showing earned shift through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "she felt whole" crystallizes reconfigured stakes after "silent, gray void," with fog's transition from barrier to meaningful hush proving cost legibility in the final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the brass screw's physicality (threads traced, cool weight) constrains choices and charges the ending, while the water clock's *plink* becomes the literal and metaphorical anchor for sensory reweighting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: sensory density builds from Hemlock's screw revelation to Elara's embodied realization ("cool metallic taste," "warmth of polished brass"), narrowing options through protagonist's agency in the "ordinary miracles" epiphany with visible cost in her fractured composure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: "silent, supportive pressure of presence" reweights "reading between the lines" via the screw's tension metaphor, avoiding moralizing while the final image answers the central question through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in aromatherapist POV ("scent of old brass," "metallic taste of fog"); rhythmic control modulates from fragmented sentences during fracture to flowing cadence in renewal, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "plink... plink... plink" repetition serves rhythm without muddle, though "ordinary miracles" slightly abstract phrasing (redeemed by immediate sensory examples) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms sensory-loss trope through specific mechanics: the midwife screw isn't symbolic ornament but causal catalyst, making absence the engine for redefined healing with irreplaceable sensory logic.</comment>
