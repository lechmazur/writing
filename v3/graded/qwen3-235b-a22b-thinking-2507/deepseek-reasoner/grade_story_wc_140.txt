<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in K’s shift from seeking "texture of memories" to bearing "cold stone" of truth; embodied emotion in "phantom outlines" avoids therapy-speak. Single-POV baseline met, but no second character limits relationship crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "cold, hard weight of justice" crystallizes stance after K’s anonymous act. Accumulative lens holds—tidal rhythm and fragment accumulation tighten pressure to the label’s discovery. Cost proof: "K’s own erased history felt insignificant next to this violent act."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices (tides govern access, prying sealed units) and charge closure as "silent witnesses." Sensory hierarchy—smell of salt, groaning steel—filters through K’s perception, avoiding tourist catalog. Micro-setting (poison label) constrains the final action decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (giving voice to erased histories) escalates through K’s agency: layering whispers evolves into cross-referencing for cover-up proof. Meaningful tightening occurs when K shifts from passive collection to active investigation ("layered these whispers over the location"), narrowing options to anonymous disclosure with visible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: poison label reweights "texture of memories" into "weight of justice." Final image ("stories once unearthed could never be drowned") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo. Complexity embraced—K’s insignificance versus victim’s erasure rejects tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: K’s "filtering reality differently" shapes syntax ("phantom outlines," "palimpsest of erased histories"). Rhythmic control mirrors tidal pressure—lyrical cadence in discovery beats tightens into staccato urgency post-label. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "ruined carpets" implying neglect while advancing plot. Final line’s "never be drowned again" recharges tidal motif with conceptual cost. Figurative language ("steel walls groaning as if breathing") serves pressure without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic erasure into physical landscape: shipping containers as memory palimpsest feels inevitable. Fresh inflection in K’s motivation—not reclaiming name but seeking "texture of memories"—avoids victimhood tropes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
