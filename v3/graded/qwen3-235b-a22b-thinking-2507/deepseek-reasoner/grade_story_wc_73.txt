<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through concrete embodiment ("thumb tracing the jagged scar") and contradictory impulses (grim optimism vs mathematical control). Final choice earned by prior causality, but "balancedly daring" phrasing slightly overused without sufficient variation in expression during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: the soil shoot reconfigures confinement's meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("definition had changed"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the rupture emerges organically from density of mathematical ritual without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chipped die functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must accept flawed outcome) and charges closure (imperfection as "source of potential"). Staircase’s sensory specificity ("worn, grey stone," "mist swirling") directly enables the final image’s transformative power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: her mathematical proof culminates in the dice roll, a decisive choice that forecloses quantification for acceptance. Conceptual cost ("equations not a key but a seed") is unmistakable in the soil’s emergence, reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chipped die’s flaw reweights "perpetual motion" as transformation, not cycle. Final image ("each step a new roll") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, embracing complexity through fertile contradiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasting of dust and infinity") and rhythmic control under pressure shine. Sentence variation ("A one and a six. A rupture.") modulates intensity perfectly, with no head-hopping or register drift in this single-POV masterpiece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story with surgical precision. Figurative language ("soundless sonic boom") heightens pressure without muddle, and final line’s cadence ("fertile feel of what was to come") delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms infinite staircase trope through mathematical lens and "texture of missed opportunity" specificity. Emotional truth in flawed dice as generative force avoids cliché, with risk-taking (conceptual rupture over physical escape) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
