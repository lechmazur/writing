<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (solitude vs sharing) manifests in concrete micro-choices like polishing rhythm and angling glass, but emotional progression lacks visible irrationality; solitude's cost remains abstract despite strong embodied polishing details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (abandoning solitude) when Elara crystallizes her stance as "lens," with aperture discovery tightening options under Accumulative lens; orientation clear by 80 words anchors grotto stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto functions as micro-setting that charges closure: mist-filtered light and fissure aperture constrain the pivotal light-capturing action, while sea glass's physical properties directly enable the final emerald illumination on wet stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single escalation (discovering fissure aperture) narrows options under Accumulative lens, forcing Elara's stance crystallization with felt cost (sacrificing solitude); dominant stake (share light without fire) signaled early via cold sky promise and polished through tangible light manipulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—sea glass polishing, emerald light painting—not abstraction; final "constellation on the ground" image resonates as non-literal answer to sharing light, avoiding moralizing while charging solitude's cost through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in star-watcher's light-focused noticing ("zephyr bloom tone," "frost-blue sea glass"), but filter verbs ("she understood," "she remembered") slightly dull immediacy during reflection without sufficient present-moment micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflection ("As memories resurface...") creates paraphrase loop; otherwise, crystalline prose with strong verbs ("coiling mists," "exploded") avoids figurative muddle, though "dull pebble" to "gleaming" transition slightly over-tells the transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "found object epiphany" trope through specific no-fire constraint and coastal grit; emotional truth in polishing ritual feels fresh, though "zephyr bloom" risks quirkiness without deeper integration into pressure moments.</comment>
