<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chuckle at folly warring with bone-deep belief," but micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during climax; arrow-tip placement feels inspired rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: bell schematic crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("alloys resistant to acid" against corrosive sea), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through density shift from "frantic clatter" to "rhythmic click."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Acid sea micro-setting pressures choices (kaleidoscope aimed downward), and arrow tip charges closure via "shimmering mandala" to bell design; weak spot: "bleached bones of spires" lacks tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Kiv's agency: arrow-tip placement reconfigures stakes through "syntax of progress," with conceptual cost legible in "resonant bell" defying "amorphous seethe" of the sea.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete transliteration ("map of choices"), avoiding moralizing; final bell design offers non-literal answer to "ring a bell no one hears," though "world’s shifting DNA" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mechanic’s gaze ("gears grinding with desperate need"), rhythmic control peaks during machine’s shift; minor register drift in "profound, mechanical want" slightly over-intellectualizes tinkerer’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "seething, emerald waves... bleached bones" varies sensory density without muddle; peak beat "gears spun a map not of places, but of choices" achieves high propulsion with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of emotional yearning as mechanical process ("ached for answers"), with corrosive sea as relentless constraint; avoids tropes through specific "kaleidoscope transliteration" physics shaping the bell’s logic.</comment>
