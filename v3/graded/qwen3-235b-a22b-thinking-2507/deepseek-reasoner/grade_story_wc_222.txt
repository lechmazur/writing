<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's chivalrous contradiction ("stole from hoarders," returned overpayments) manifests in her pivotal destruction of the obsidian shard, with embodied cost in "client's promise felt like ash." Apprentice's dialogue avoids epiphany clichés by grounding insight in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via Elara's shard destruction: Master's sigh and corrected sky reconfigure the dominant stake (protecting wonder) with felt cost. Causal lens holds through because/therefore linkage from her choice to consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound spire functions as micro-setting: "ice silent under soft-soled boots" constrains movement, while the sky's "bruised violet" directly charges the final image when restored to stars. Tool (chess pieces) constrains the key amendment choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally when Apprentice reveals the lid's true purpose, narrowing Elara's options to theft or protection. Cost crystallizes as "ash" when she destroys the shard—visible price altering her path with irreversible moral consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the shattered obsidian (not the sundial lid) reweights "embracing the unknown" as protection, not acquisition. Final line ("keep time interesting") avoids moralizing while charging the central conflict with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara's "rough" voice versus Apprentice's "icicle chime" carries subtext through diction ("yearns," "ash"). Rhythmic control peaks in the shard destruction beat with purposeful compression ("dropped it... shattered into dust").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "bruised violet sky shot through with veins of shimmering gold" exemplifies high-density textural specificity. Minor deduction for "heart a drum" cliché in high-pressure beat, though redeemed by subsequent action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "thief with heart" trope through specific moral calculus: chivalry isn't idealism but hunger-driven compulsion. The sundial lid's subversion (not treasure but cap on chaos) offers fresh inflection that grows organically from the chessboard stakes.</comment>
