<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (skepticism vs courageous empathy) drive the pivotal choice to transcribe emotions, with visible cost in her trembling hand. Uncle remains off-page, limiting relationship depth despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ledger’s "map of solace" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (worldview shift), under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the magic square tile’s warmth/memory-transmission directly constrains Elara’s choices and charges the final image. Whale migration timing and tower’s broken circle deepen atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: choosing to "answer his call" reweights the dominant stake (skepticism vs connection) with felt cost in her trembling purpose. Whale migration tightens decision window organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "sculpting space for reflection" evolves from clinical ledger-filling to emotional transcription, resolving in the non-literal "map of solace" without moralizing. Whale song’s transformation embodies the thematic shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catalog it," "transcribe the feeling into form") modulates from clinical to lyrical under pressure. Rhythm accelerates with the symphony’s swelling, teaching its pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dissolving, their purpose served" follows "shimmering" without redundancy. Final line’s "chorus echoing... finally heard" delivers maximum resonance without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms magic square trope into emotional conduit. Whale migration entangled with uncle’s loneliness avoids derivative pitfalls, though risk-taking stops short of 9+ distinction.</comment>
