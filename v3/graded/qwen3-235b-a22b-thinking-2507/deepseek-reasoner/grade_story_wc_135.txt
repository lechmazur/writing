<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (combating forgetting through fragments) and exile backstory create embodied contradiction; micro-choice to reframe the ship’s record shows hierarchy of values with visible cost ("silence of its trumpet had been her freedom"). Lacks higher-stakes pressure testing her "hearten" drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: valve transforms from artifact to "seed" with undeniable conceptual cost ("freedom" via shipwreck). Accumulative lens holds through layered discoveries, but "silent warning" reveal slightly telegraphs the ending’s emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor’s rain-washed stones and dripping water actively constrain choices (tracing valve in wet conditions); the harbor’s shift from "missing teeth" to "open" directly charges the final image. Micro-setting (valve as seed) is indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (combating forgetting) tightens when exile connection emerges; pressure grows through document discoveries. Agency in reframing the ship’s record forecloses mourning with conceptual cost, but "silent warning" reveal lacks sufficient resistance before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "navigated absences" concept without moralizing; final image ("seed containing past") answers central question with earned complexity. Avoids false balance—exile was wrong, but sacrifice inadvertently freed her.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots whispering against wet granite," salt-sting as comfort); syntax mirrors archival precision. Near-identical "staggered intervals" phrasing slightly dilutes rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gaps like missing teeth" shows concrete charge. Final line’s rhythm ("cold brass now feeling like a seed") propels closure. Minor deduction for repeated "reactively visionary" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope via marine-specific "navigated absences" and exile resolution (freedom via shipwreck). Valve-as-seed image feels inevitable yet fresh, but emotional specificity doesn’t quite reach transcendent universality.</comment>
