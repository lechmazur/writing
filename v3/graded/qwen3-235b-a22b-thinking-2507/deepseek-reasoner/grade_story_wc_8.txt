<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Aris uses emotional rationality to dissect the letter's hidden truth, not suppress fear; embodied cost in Elara's silent surrender. Slight underdevelopment of Elara's internal shift limits to 8.6.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the case closing crystallizes the "delicate space between" lie/truth with Elara's visible concession. Orientation anchors by line 3; causal lens holds with petal→meeting→argument→recapture linkage. One hairline slip in reflection pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Illuminated letter functions as micro-setting that charges closure—Aris's analysis of the knight's grip directly enables persuasion. Ivy/rosebush set tone but don't constrain choices; station setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: petal drop tightens timeline, argument pivots on whether destruction/preservation serves truth. Visible cost in Elara's silent surrender forecloses her path. Minor slip: knight/dragon analysis resolves conflict slightly too neatly without new complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the letter's duality—truth hidden in lie—not moralizing. Final image ("delicate, dangerous space between") reweights premise without stating moral. Avoids thematic echo but final line risks slight over-articulation of insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices artistic tension (spear grip, tail coil) reflecting his historian's eye. Rhythmic control under pressure ("You don't burn the map to the treasure...") avoids dialogue clichés. One near-synonym in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension ("The final petal trembled... dropped. Its fall was the signal"). Final image ("breathtaking beauty and terrible contradiction") crystallizes dualities without muddle. Peak-beat metaphors precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "noble lies" trope through specific historian's dilemma and the letter's art analysis. Fresh inflection in using illumination as evidence of hidden truth. Avoids safety middle by rejecting binary destruction/preservation for nuanced preservation.</comment>
