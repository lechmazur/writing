<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "borrowed existence" vs heartbeat defiance; final choice to stop counting earns visible cost through ink-shard micro-choice. No stock phrasing—flaws drive the crisis without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "survival was not an error to be corrected" reweights existence under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by word 15; lens clarity avoids ambiguity penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Porcelain shard constrains choice (focal point for defragmentation) and charges final image; snow-bound observatory alters tactics by muting stars. Micro-setting gate satisfied with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' agency: ink-shard placement tightens options under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "relentless autopsy" agony, but secondary stake (rival's success) lacks pressure depth for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through porcelain shard's reweighted meaning: "piece of a whole... should never be put back together" rejects false wholeness. Zero moralizing; wisdom earned via ink-defragmentation struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "swirling pattern he saw in spilled ink" shows character-particular noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure ("commands a soft whisper") avoids head-hopping despite reflective blocks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" achieves high density. But "metronome ticking off seconds of borrowed existence" violates physical logic (metronome measures tempo, not time), triggering -0.8 artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital/analogue failure through ink-defragmentation method. Bold risk in making "digital ghost" a memory echo rather than literal AI, heightening emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
