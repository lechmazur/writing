<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s tranquilly perceptive nature isn’t stated but embodied through sensory recalibration in darkness; her micro-choice flipping the stamp to "FALSE COPY" reveals contradictory impulses (duty to truth vs. protecting the city) with grim, logical cost—no diagnostic labels, pure causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: power returning while Elara "carry[ing] this quiet knowledge" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("foundation of theft"); Accumulative lens holds via sensory density tightening her realization, and the persistent constraint (stamp’s weight) shapes her final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ink stamp functions as micro-setting—constraining verification (must use it for fused text) and charging closure (flipped plate as truth-preserver); "dappled resolve" lighting isn’t decor but actively shapes her decision in the final beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. stability) tighten through Elara’s agency: blackout enables choice, stamp reveals surrender terms, and her flip to "FALSE COPY" forecloses reporting truth with felt cost ("devastating weight of history" made legible in her guarded role).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stamp’s transformation—from authentication tool to truth-preserver—without moralizing; final image ("keeper of deeper truth") reweights "reclaimed stillness" as enduring burden, avoiding false equivalence by committing to truth’s preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: notices "minute shift of settling shelf," not visuals; rhythm modulates from flowing during discovery to clipped phrases at climax ("She flipped... pressed..."); zero head-hopping, pure interiority calibrated to pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold—every sentence does triple duty (e.g., "light and shadow playing over endless shelves" sets atmosphere, theme, and action); final line’s "reclaimed a part of it forever" has crystalline rhythm without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms historical cover-up trope via sunken-city mechanics: ink stamp as palimpsest revealer feels fresh, and the "FALSE COPY" twist on truth-preservation is non-obvious; risk-taking (internal climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
