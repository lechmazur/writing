<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between chemist's analytical mind and emotional grief drives the epiphany; embodied ache ("dull, heavy") avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice releasing chrysalis earns the shift with visible cost. No stock phrasing—insight emerges from river foam observation, not abstract reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "let his grief loosen its rigid structure" forecloses isolated regret. Accumulative lens holds—foam density increase reweights separation as connection. Backstory block (25% length) anchors present stance via micro-choice (chrysalis grip), satisfying BRR. Cost proof: "fluid, something that could hold both loss and love without breaking" crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Braided ravine functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—river foam patterns directly trigger the insight. Final chrysalis-on-water image charges closure by reweighting absence as process. Sensory details filtered through chemist's POV ("colloidal dispersion," "surfactants") avoid tourist cataloging. Environment shapes the thematic resolution irreducibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating separation into connection) tightens through Aris's foam observation, narrowing options to "isolated regret" or "weaving love." Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens—the river's braiding principle reconfigures his understanding with felt cost ("rigid polymer of grief" becoming fluid). Stakes viscerally felt via embodied ache, not abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from river/chrysalis motifs: "separation wasn't an end, but a part of connection" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image ("he would learn to braid") offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo—insight arises from concrete foam observation, not prompt-like statements. Complexity honored through grief's "dull, heavy ache" persisting beneath transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chemist's "symphonically minded" lens shapes opening ("complex composition of rushing water") and climax ("symphony after a key change"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases for realization ("He could accept the separation"). Zero POV slippage; professional lexicon ("colloidal dispersion") stays character-bound without jarring register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multitask (e.g., "grief was a rigid, crystalline structure" conveys emotion + profession). Final line "carrying her with him" recharges chrysalis motif with precision. Minor deduction for "brutal fact of separation"—slightly elevated diction in peak beat, though mitigated by scientific voice. Figurative language ("lace-like pattern") remains clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through polymer science lens—"braiding" metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh. Emotional specificity ("dull, heavy ache" vs tears) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes: professional observation (foam patterns) becomes the engine of emotional reconfiguration. Synthesis feels non-obvious yet coherent, resisting middle-ground hedging.</comment>
