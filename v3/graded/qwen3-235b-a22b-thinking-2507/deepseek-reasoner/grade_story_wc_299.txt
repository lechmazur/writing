<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "meticulously, confidently uncertain" appraisal versus emotional truth; photo reveal earns closure with visible cost of wasted years. No therapy-speak; embodied emotion in trembling hands and "echo valley longing" avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density; Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "silence no longer emptiness." Orientation clear by para 1; cost legible in final image reconfiguring quarry's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarry trailer establishes tone but fails to constrain choices; cloth and coffee function as micro-setting charging final image. Sensory specificity strong ("rust-colored stain as Coca-Cola"), yet environment doesn't actively pressure Leo's decision to search venues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Leo's agency: appraisal → file search → photo realization. Dominant stake (purpose after loss) tightens through cloth's evolving meaning; cost of emotional insulation made visceral in "years believing worth died with final note."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cloth motif's reweighting: "most important work happened after applause" crystallizes non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; complexity in valuing creation over glory resonates through concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: technical lexicon ("weave count," "acrylic-nylon") fused with emotional texture ("ghost of memory"). Rhythm modulates under pressure; no POV slippage. "Echo valley longing" exemplifies character-particular diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "relic from life at deafening volume." Minor overwriting in "echo valley longing" (-0.1) but no closure artifacts. Final line’s propulsion ("help build it") recharges motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes "has-been artist" trope through appraiser lens: "silent, valuable dead things" transforms loss into fresh premise. Risk in quiet closure pays off; specificity of speaker cloth elevates emotional truth beyond generic redemption arc.</comment>
