<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fidgeting productively" vs focused tracing; embodied emotion ("sharp stone in his gut") avoids therapy-speak. Final choice earned by prior causality, though student backstory edges toward summary without full dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "calm so profound it felt like violence against his long-held anguish." Accumulative lens holds perfectly as tapestry decoding reweights stakes. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the tapestry’s frayed threads constrain choice (decoding method) and charge closure ("decoded the map to forgiveness"). Sensory details filtered through Elias’s tutor eye ("crimson thread was courage, now snapped") avoid tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Elias’s shift from frantic puzzle-solving to tapestry investigation. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the humility move, but thunder’s role as pressure source lacks sufficient causal weight for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "abandoned crimson thread was his own arrogant gambit." Final image reweights labyrinth as "key," not victory, avoiding moralizing. Slight overwriting in "fierce repose" prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tutor’s eye seeing not a mess, but a language") and rhythmic control under pressure. Focalization stays tightly bound to Elias, though "woven hush" repetition risks overuse without full pattern payoff in final beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats; high density ("chaotic threads were not mistakes, but a record"). Slight overwriting in opening ("tapestry of suspended breath") deducts 0.1. Propulsion flawless through syntax mirroring Elias’s shifting focus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chess logic and textile craft avoids trope. "Solution was surrender, not victory" delivers fresh inflection on forgiveness tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
