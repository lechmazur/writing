<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; "infinitely patient" remains label without embodied struggle during climax, missing micro-choice hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with legible cost ("fleeting moment"), but escalation lacks resistance—town responds immediately without narrowing options or raising stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ebony fork and cobblestones constrain choices (rhythm as method) and charge final image; sensory details like "sub-sonic hum" and "flam" of loose stones reflect urgency with tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spiritual balance) tightens through rhythmic accumulation, but pressure lacks complication—no obstacle forces adaptation, reducing earned cost despite visible temporal fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared balance emerges through concrete actions (propping lintel, clearing culvert), but final image lacks conceptual repricing—resonance leans on beauty over irreversible cost reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listening with bones," rhythmic syntax mirroring footsteps) modulates under pressure; no head-hopping, though reflection on disaster risks BRR overuse at 15%.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("Tap. Step. Tap-tap. Step." compresses tension), but "wild hush" description in final paragraph risks thematic echo without deepening cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics and spiritual restoration feels inevitable, though "ghost town revival" premise borders on familiar—elevated by specific rhythmic method and earned fragility.</comment>
