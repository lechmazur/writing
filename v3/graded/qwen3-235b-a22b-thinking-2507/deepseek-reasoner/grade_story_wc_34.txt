<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (silenced singer articulating others’ needs) manifests in embodied micro-choices like tracing the railing and translating light into song. Ghost’s presence lacks sufficient depth as a character despite kinship theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elara’s first note and the courtyard’s hum crystallize reconfigured stakes with visible cost ("familiar pressure in her throat... eased"). Storm resolution edges toward coincidence but doesn’t break Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (flower press bolt plate) constrains choice and charges the final image via solidified mist murals. Sensory specificity ("cold, damp stone," "spectrum of light") filters through Elara’s balladeer perspective without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the storm’s approach ("palpable stillness between lightning and thunder"), narrowing Elara’s window for encoding. Agency-driven escalation earns the cost, though the ghost’s "corruption" remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: graffiti as desperate pleas, mist solidifying into murals. Final image ("city lights twinkled like a thousand answers") resonates without moralizing, reweighting the central question of voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") modulates under pressure; rhythm accelerates during lightning strike. Voice remains anchored in Elara’s balladeer lexicon without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spectrum of light erupted" shows rather than tells. "Heart hammered a tinkersong wonder" slightly overwrites but avoids muddle. Final line’s "quiet, tinkersong wonder" charges closure without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost and balladeer transcends trope; "graffiti as communication" feels inevitable. Emotional specificity ("joy of connection, despair of corruption") avoids generic templates while risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
