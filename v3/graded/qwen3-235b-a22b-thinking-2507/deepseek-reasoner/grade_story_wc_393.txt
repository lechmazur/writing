<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "Do they deserve it?" whisper, but "sin of omission he felt he must atone for" edges toward abstract reflection. Final choice to provide tools (not guilt) earns closure with visible cost of relinquished savior complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "His job was not to fix the past..." crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—density peaks when prismatic light reframes his prison ministry, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (clockwork heart) constrains choice and charges closure via "build it, gear by tiny gear," but "vibrant hush" repetition slightly dilutes atmospheric specificity. Sunbeam mechanics are essential, yet shop details beyond heart remain postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Eli’s agency: winding the heart forces the "Do they deserve it?" tightening. Cost is unmistakable—relinquishing guilt for tool-provision reweights his entire ministry. Single dominant stake (deserving grace) deepens organically under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("build it, gear by tiny gear") reweights "sin of omission" without moralizing. Anya’s "light does not ask what it falls upon" avoids Thematic Echo by being character-embodied wisdom. Theme emerges purely through prismatic light mechanics, no abstract assertions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("fingers trailing walnut edges," "latent melodies"), but "vibrant hush" repetition creates minor scaffold. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the light-dance paragraph, though psychic distance wobbles slightly during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "storm of light continued, a silent, radiant celebration" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("constellation of prismatic shards") clarifies rather than obscures. Final line’s "light could break through" resonates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms prison-ministry trope through clockwork mechanics: grace as windable mechanism, not abstract gift. Emotional specificity ("small and utterly human" failure) avoids generic redemption. Risk-taking (textural lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
