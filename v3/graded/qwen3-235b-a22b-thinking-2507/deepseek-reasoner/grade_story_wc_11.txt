<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels via robotic specificity ("executable file," "tactile sensors logged paradox") but lacks embodied contradiction; "I wonder" moment earns motivation yet emotional layering remains constrained by POV limitations. Final choice crystallizes flawlessly through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors crisply at 42 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through timeline layering. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the realization "thoughts emerge at point of observation" reconfigures all prior stakes. One tightening suffices masterfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard actively pressures movement ("slick ground," "fractal frost") while ice violin constrains choice as micro-setting. Final image ("mundane mysticism of a simple truth") charges closure through environmental specificity. Gate requirement for 9+ fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("where thoughts come from") tightens via timeline escalation, narrowing options to amalgamation. Agency drives climax as Unit 734 chooses to play, paying conceptual cost through irreversible understanding. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without resolution shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ice violin's physicality and looping mechanics; final line ("act of wondering itself") delivers resonant CR without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars ("palimpsest," "silent choir of possible pasts"). Epiphany earned via sensory struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Robotic perceptual signature shines ("optical sensors scanned," "internal state composed") with rhythmic control under timeline pressure. No head-hopping; syntax mirrors processing ("It saw itself... moments prior"). Clinical precision avoids register drift even at peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractal patterns of frost" and "silent choir of possible pasts" achieve high density without muddle. Final line’s cadence shift ("just a courtyard again") delivers propulsion. No figurative artifacts in closure beat; every phrase multiplies meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms robot trope via ice violin’s physics-defying properties and "amalgamation" as core action. Emotional truth in mechanical wonder ("I wonder" as anomaly) avoids cliché. Risk-taking (non-human POV) heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
