<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (writer vs conductor) shown through micro-choices, but "familiar enigma" abstraction lacks embodied cost during crisis; final choice's cost ("old life receding") feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with legible cost in "old life receding like the tide," but accidental prophecy relies on coincidence weakening causal pressure under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam as "slow, silent scythe" and microdot specs function as micro-setting that constrains choices (treacherous walk, burning hand) and charges final image; sensory details filtered through Leo's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Leo's role in network) signaled early; escalation driven by agency (delivering specs) with cost legible in final image, but "accidental" prophecy undermines causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "open secrets" emerges through concrete actions (cookies as navigation points), final image reweights "transpose" metaphor without moralizing; avoids abstraction until "familiar enigma" risks diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ritual complete, the familiar enigma") with rhythmic control, but "familiar enigma" abstraction introduces diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, dulling immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with purposeful fragments, but paraphrase loop in "ritual complete, the familiar enigma" and template cadence in early sentences reduce density; final beat clean with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune cookies as spy tools avoids tropes through specific microdot specs and lighthouse mechanics; emotional truth in Leo's quiet transformation outweighs derivative "secret network" premise.</comment>
