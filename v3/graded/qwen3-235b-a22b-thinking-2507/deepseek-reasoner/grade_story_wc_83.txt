<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied trauma ("ghost limb" sensation) and micro-choices (retrieving geode mid-power failure), but "mathematical fluke" backstory risks over-articulation. Contradictory impulses (bleakness vs. exhilaration) earn the final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "learn how to drink" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost (ruined eye aching with "perception"). Accumulative lens holds through resonant density buildup; circuit-breaker timing tightens pressure without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting—zero-g movement and power-cycle window directly constrain tactics. Geode crystal charges final image ("light from within"), though cosmic descriptions occasionally verge on generic ("star-dusted blackness").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake tightening is masterful: resonance in K-7B forces stance crystallization where "hope had not been exploded." Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; "bleak exhilaration" crystallizes cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "unfiltered awakening" reconfigures loss as cosmic accumulation. Final image ("learn how to drink") offers resonant non-literal answer to "where unused potential pools" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in diction ("dowsing rod for the intangible," "cathedral of amethyst spikes"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure during hunt; minor lexicon slip in "mathematical fluke" doesn't disrupt voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via dense, multi-jobbing lines ("a cathedral of amethyst spikes" serves character and setting). Final line’s crystalline simplicity ("learn how to drink") avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma physics ("perturbation theory of death") and cosmic hope transforms tropes. Geode-as-resonator feels inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
