<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied deafness ("bones of her inner ear") drives credible choices; contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) manifest in her silent expressiveness during the Bloom's healing. Final endurance carries visible cost without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("body aching with cold and effort") under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens through density escalation as thermal shifts map the Bloom's decay. No causality breaks despite lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Conservatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—the crack threatens the microclimate, forcing Elara's thermal mapping method. Final image of "fierce, golden light" recharges the ice's role in both problem and solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency: the Bloom's fading aura narrows options to heat-mapping, with physical exhaustion as tangible cost. Escalation driven by her fork trials reweights the dominant stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "translating silence into music" resolves not as moral but as felt resonance ("universe hum"). Final image reweights silence as connective tissue without abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in thermal vocabulary ("blush of amber," "desperate blue") reflecting her sensory shift. Voice modulates under pressure—crisis beats compress syntax while sustaining the note elongates rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "web of golden warmth radiating through the ice" layers sensory, thematic, and causal work. Final line’s "universe hum" avoids cliché through precise physicality, with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms deafness trope via heat-mapping mechanics: silence isn’t absence but palpable resonance. Risk-taking in making unhearable music the climax feels inevitable through prior thermal specificity.</comment>
