<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "inherited fire bent to saving purpose," but motivation "to prove scars can sing" lacks sufficient friction in pivotal grafting beat; embodied emotion otherwise exemplary through sterile sand application.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: coin's chime reconfigures legacy with visceral cost ("weight finally shed"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation to undeniable resilience vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains choices—mirror effect enables coin's light-refraction climax; black sand transitions from "gritty testament" to grafting medium, charging final image with geological specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation (charcoal-choked lagoon → green shoots), but cloud migration timeframe lacks live-clock pressure; cost is felt through "weight shed" yet escalation needs sharper tightening before tying coin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Scars can sing" emerges purely through coin's chime and tree's vibration—no moralizing; final image reweights father's legacy as "music forged in compassion" with conceptual cost of inherited fire redeemed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "kelp-drift peace" rhythm and volcanic lexicon; minor register drift in "stubborn, active force" disrupts otherwise flawless compression of "dancer’s poise married to vigilance."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gritty testament to fire" and "metallic song" achieve perfect density; slight deduction for "unyielding compassion" abstraction in high-pressure grafting beat diluting embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope through volcanic grafting ritual; "foreign coin" device feels inevitable yet fresh, though risk-taking stops short of deeper moral ambiguity in arsonist legacy.</comment>
