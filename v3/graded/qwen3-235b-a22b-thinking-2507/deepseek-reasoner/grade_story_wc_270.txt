<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("evolve tradition with intent") drives micro-choices like humming sequence, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "implanted destiny" concept remains abstract despite embodied actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with undeniable cost (defiance against council condemnation), but the embryo’s transition from amber to soil lacks sufficient struggle to fully earn the transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Volcanic springs constrain choice (water temperature/harmony method) and charge final image; moss/fern telepathy integrates setting with action, avoiding static description through purposeful sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (council condemnation), but pressure doesn’t tighten concretely during climax; council threat remains abstract without on-page consequences altering tactics despite high personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "grafting forgotten potential," but final line’s "not to restore what was lost" edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining earned ambiguity with near-moralizing phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ferns’ slow songs," "mosses’ patient wisdom") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyric compression taught early (kite script decoded via plants) pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mineral-rich waters a stark contrast" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "implanted destiny" bordering on therapy-speak in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "insurgent grandmother" and plant telepathy avoids tropes; volcanic springs as method (not backdrop) transforms reconstruction theme. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
