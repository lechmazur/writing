<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotion ("fingers smudged with ancient ink," "heart hammered") grounds motivation, but final testimony lacks micro-choices showing contradictory impulses under pressure; duty settles too smoothly without visible internal trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("new kind of quiet filled with potential") reweights language's dormancy with felt cost, but the harmonic resonance emerges coincidentally without sufficient causal buildup under Accumulative lens, triggering -0.8 Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library’s acoustics actively constrain choices: crystal’s sonic reflection only works within the space, and the final word’s amplification relies on marble/books—environment charges the climax where "sound rippled out, caught and amplified."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (language death vs. renewal) tighten meaningfully when the crystal responds, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the harmonic resonance happens *to* Elara rather than through her choices, violating Band guardrail for visible price before testimony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "weathered innocence" transforms to "hope" as characters test voices, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("a new language was being born") resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced," "skeletal beast" chandelier) modulates with pressure; rhythmic control shifts from scholarly precision to lyrical urgency. No head-hopping, and elision of backstory stays anchored to crystal handling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor template cadence ("The air held... The silence was broken...") and "fractured sequences" repetition dull momentum. Zero figurative muddle, but scaffolded openings in high-pressure beats prevent 9.0+ despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through linguistic specificity—sonic crystal device feels fresh, not derivative. "First light after long silence" synthesizes premise inevitably, but "Great Stillness" edges toward familiar phrasing without sufficient reweighting.</comment>
