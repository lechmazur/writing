<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (purpose vs vulnerability) drives tethering choice; embodied emotion ("wilts," "nausea of spirit") avoids labels. Final renunciation of dishonesty earned by vision cost but competence lacks sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: shadow shatters → light spills with visible cost (weariness lifting). Causal lens holds but escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options; single tightening insufficient for 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Music box functions as micro-setting that charges closure: light spilling from lid reweights "reclaiming light" with concrete cost. Resonance Chamber's amplification directly enables diagnostic method without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing discord to reclaim light) tightens via tethering choice with felt cost (spiritual wilting). Pressure grows under causal lens but resolution lacks tactical trade-offs; deception shatters too easily for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of light spilling from box offers resonant non-literal answer to "reclaiming light" without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete mending act; shame's bleed into object avoids abstraction. One perspective limits counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tinkersong," "covenant of rust") modulates rhythm under pressure; tethering sequence uses controlled compression. Zero head-hopping; voice remains consistent through vision's sensory torrent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "nausea of spirit" slightly purple but doesn't dull closure. Final line ("weary but everlasting tinkersong wonder") charges image with high density. Figurative language sparse enough to avoid density penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mending as truth-recovery avoids fantasy tropes; "covenant of rust" transforms through specific mechanics. Emotional specificity in shame's physical bleed elevates beyond novelty. Safety-hedging in effortless resolution caps band.</comment>
