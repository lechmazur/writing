<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation lacks concrete contradiction until climax; "longing for something unnamed" risks abstraction despite strong embodied ache in "hollow of her chest". Micro-choices under pressure (frantic light-gathering) earn high marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: silent islands and empty palette crystallize cost of answered longing. Accumulative lens holds through density of whispers transforming into reality; "the whispers had ceased" makes conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Palette (micro-setting) charges closure as "key," but archipelago functions more as atmospheric chorus than constraint. "Lichen bloomed in sudden, vibrant gold" shows environment evolving causally, yet spatial choreography lacks tangible pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (capturing runaway dream) tightens through the island's "desperate cry," driving Elara's agency in throwing light at the beacon. Cost is visceral in "whispers ceased" and softened ache—escalation perfectly calibrated to Accumulative lens with no convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("palette now dull and empty... finally learned how to read") reweights longing without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: light-transformations answer the cipher, avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("cipher of longing encoded in salt air"), but "hollow of her own chest" edges toward bodily cliché. Rhythmic control under pressure strong, though minor register drift in "luminous absence" slightly disrupts voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "water stilled... lichen bloomed" shows high density. One near-overwrite ("soft hues of dawn and dusk into tangible, fleeting forms") but no closure muddle. Propulsion flawless through syntax variation and concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "artist chasing muse" trope via light-painting mechanic and archipelago-as-collective-longing. Emotional specificity in "barren rock teeming with puffins" avoids genericity; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
