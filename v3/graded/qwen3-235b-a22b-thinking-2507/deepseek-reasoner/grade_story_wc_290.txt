<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (claustrophobic panic vs wistful rebellion) drive the compass-touch decision and earned closure. No diagnostic labels; embodied fear as "cold, sharp focus" during crisis. Micro-choices like measuring steps three times establish "prudently adventurous" trait concretely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: claustrophobia becoming "a forgotten whisper" after the chamber opens. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density (hum to organ chord to silver lines) reweights stakes without causal breaks. Cost legible in final image’s emotional shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Compass point (tool) constrains every key choice and charges the final image—pressing it into stone enables the niche’s revelation. Star-map ceiling isn’t backdrop but functional constraint: lens projects onto it. Sensory hierarchy reflects explorer’s priorities (constellations over tactile details).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: touching the compass narrows options from paralysis to precise action. Dominant stake (overcoming spatial mutiny to access knowledge) tightens through her choice, with cost unmistakable in "claustrophobia a forgotten whisper" reconfiguring her state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-rebellion emerges through action, not statement. Final image ("performed a symphony to reveal it") reweights "wistful rebellion" without moralizing. Conceptual repricing occurs as the compass shifts from taunt to literal key, charging prior struggle with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: explorer’s spatial obsession shapes noticing ("inverted map of constellations"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during panic ("The sound wave washed over her") versus lyrical density at climax. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens with stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "palpable weight from the era of the fallow period" compresses backstory into atmospheric propulsion. Figurative language ("frantic bird in a stone cage") remains precise in high-pressure beats. Final line crystallizes theme without muddle: "wistful rebel who had won her war against the dark."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes through specific synthesis: compass point as literal key, organ sound as inscription tool. Emotional truth in claustrophobic triumph avoids generic templates. "Spatial mutiny" concept feels inevitable, with risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
