<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's "quiet, stubborn ember" motivation drives tangible micro-choices (pocketing nut mid-crisis), with contradictory impulses ("hand shook" at node) earning closure. "Reluctant caretaker" trait lacks early testing but final choice crystallizes through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: "oppressive weight lifting" and "caregiver finally free" reconfigure the orchard's meaning. Orientation clear by line 15; causal lens held through node insertion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nut-shaped depression physically constrains climax choice, while frost functions as active clock tightening tactics. "Heavy, smooth stone" evolves from tool to symbolic echo in final image, charging closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally when nut discovery shifts Elara from guide to resolver; agency peaks at node insertion. Cost legible in trembling hands and "silenced world," though birds' threat resolves slightly too cleanly without lingering danger during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("curse was a machine") not abstraction; final image ("just an orchard now") reweights "graceless beauty" without moralizing. Slight redundancy in "caregiver finally free" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "sun bleed into jagged horizon" filters emotion through Elara's lens. Under stress, syntax compresses ("No time. Pocketed nut.") but "impossibly heavy" slightly intrudes POV lexicon in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rhythmic, metallic whirring" demonstrates high density. Final line ("guided herself home") charges motif without overwriting. Minor deduction for "impossibly heavy" in nut discovery beat—redundant modifier for established unnaturalness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: truth-telling fruit becomes visceral via "whispering regrets," mechanical birds as "enforcers" in machine metaphor. "Reluctant caretaker" archetype lacks full subversion but risk-taking in conceptual solution elevates.</comment>
