<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stoic armor vs grief) manifest concretely in the locket breakdown; micro-choice to write "She hummed" over concerts reveals hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("sob escaping him").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("shivering and heavy... yet lighter in soul"); Accumulative lens holds as sensory density peaks with locket discovery, reweighting "interlaced absence" into visceral loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion actively constrains choices (numbed fingers in cold water, algae-slimed columns); final "darker patch against dark water" charges closure by transforming setting into "silent keeper of secrets."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: locket discovery deepens abstract "interlaced absence" into visceral loss, narrowing options to foundational acts of love; cost crystallizes in physical/emotional exhaustion ("shivering and heavy") with earned peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("quiet, burning peace") resonates without moralizing, reweighting "hushed blaze" from sunset to inner resolve; avoids thematic echo by showing "beauty sunk was not beauty lost" through concrete acts, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in surveyor's precision ("measured steps," "stoically sensitive grace"); rhythm modulates from lyrical ("hushed blaze of orange") to fragmented sob during peak stress without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "cerulean blue" specificity replaces abstraction, but slight sensory repetition ("water shockingly cold"/"fingers numb") prevents 9.0; zero loops in closure beat maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "drowned memory" trope via concrete mechanics (notes in putty); emotional specificity in "She hummed when she painted railings" avoids sentimentality, though premise lacks radical structural risk.</comment>
