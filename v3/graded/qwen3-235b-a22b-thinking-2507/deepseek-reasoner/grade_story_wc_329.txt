<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation ("quiet, desperate flame") but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice to play isn't earned through visible internal struggle. Embodied emotion remains abstract ("understood" without physical manifestation) during pivotal locust-shell moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost ("gap between knowing... and understanding what would come next"), but cost isn't unmistakable per 9+ test. Accumulative lens holds consistently through vibrational escalation to trees uprooting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Translucent sky-bridge and orchard create vivid micro-setting, but violin (primary tool) doesn't constrain choices or charge final image. Statues' softening shows environmental evolution, yet misses 9+ gate for setting to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("reawaken beauty") escalate through vibrational density under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible. Trees' uprooting narrows options meaningfully, yet "gap" realization lacks concrete forfeiture demanded by 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "tarnished wonder" to "raw, real, and growing" transformation; final image reweights beauty without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing freedom's cost via statues becoming landscape, not stating abstract wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound seeped into the bones") but filter verbs ("she saw it and understood") dull climax immediacy. Voice modulates well from sterile city to wild orchard, though minor psychic distance slippage in locust-shell revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("resonantly soft" repetition) and slight overwriting in high-pressure beat ("vibrating through the earth, a signal pulsing"). Strong rhythm otherwise, but "ghost of a creature" edges toward thematic convenience in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-ecological-force avoids mechanical/alien tropes through specific vibrational mechanics. Emotional truth in "messy, root-tangled, glorious beauty" elevates premise, though city-or-orchard dichotomy lacks deeper transformation.</comment>
