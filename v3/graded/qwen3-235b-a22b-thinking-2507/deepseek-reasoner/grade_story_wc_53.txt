<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "eroded ambitions" vs. resolute scavenger identity; embodied regret transforms into "dull, useful tool" with cost. "Chronologically confused" trait remains label-only, not constraining choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "unexposed film... weightless, perfect burden" reconfigures ambition with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through atmospheric density, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: camera wheel constrains choices (offering potential) and charges final image; cloud-moss alters movement ("boots making no sound"). Lagoon’s "churning waters" supply the ghost’s substance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when ghost declares "I am your blueprint," narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is legible in transformed regret; agency drives escalation via Elara’s offering, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: unused camera reframes ambition as "reshaped" foundation. Avoids moralizing—"blueprint" insight arises from negotiation, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "temporal soup," "ozone and forgotten things" filter world through scavenger’s lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("fractured stillness was now just stillness").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gritty purpose" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete payoff. Propulsion via dense imagery: "seahorses peeling," "rust-pipe sigh." Final line’s "weightless, perfect burden" crystallizes cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost of past self" trope through kinetic lagoon specificity and camera wheel’s "empty potential" metaphor. Emotional truth in "not your regret. I am your blueprint" avoids cliché.</comment>
