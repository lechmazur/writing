<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("willingly perplexed") drives choices; embodied emotion in blood ritual and daughter's "new eyes" avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of time-reclamation earned by the saucer's vision with palpable cost in dried blood stain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "ready to descend" crystallizes stance with felt cost (dried blood, imperfect vessel). Accumulative lens holds—each vision deepens understanding without causal breaks. Orientation perfect by line 3; cost legible in "blood dried to rust-colored stain."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dolls' saucer constrains every choice—from blood offering to final wrapping—and charges closure as "precious heirloom." Sensory details ("thin air carried choking beauty") reflect urgency while avoiding cliché; environment actively shapes ritual tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) tightens via Silas's agency: blood offering → unfastening → vision escalation. Keeper's "vessel is cracked" warning raises cost visibly. Final deepening (daughter's future ritual) reweights options with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through saucer's blood vision—not statement. Final image ("wrapped in silk") resonates as non-literal answer: time held in ritual continuity. Avoids moralizing; "choking beauty" evolves from oppressive to clarifying without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartomancer lens ("constellations on hands align with cards"). Rhythmic control under pressure—"He must try" compresses diction. Voice modulates from ritual solemnity to aching clarity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "blood along the crack shimmered" does triple duty (visual/emotional/thematic). Figurative language precise ("hairline crack a tiny white lightning bolt"). Minor overwriting in "choking beauty" repetition costs 0.1 in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: "cloudbound repentance" grounded in dolls' saucer ritual. Emotional specificity in "sticky handprint" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (lyric time-weaving) heightens stakes while closure remains legible.</comment>
