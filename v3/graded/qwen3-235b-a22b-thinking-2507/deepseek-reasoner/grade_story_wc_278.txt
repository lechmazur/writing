<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("dissonant chord") and embodied emotion ("air hummed with latent energy") power micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation of guilt earned through amber action with visible cost ("dissonance hushed").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: the amber's "soft internal light" crystallizes reconfigured options after tangible effort; causal lens holds through glitch→letters→solution with no retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (amber) constrains the climax choice and charges the final image; "laboratory of lost sounds" isn't backdrop but active pressure shaping every tactic with sensory specificity ("honey-gold piece... warm and pulsing").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: glitch forces letter discovery, which narrows options to amber solution; cost legible in "dissonance hushed... finally properly laid to rest" under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sound of an ending" reweights grief without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by letting the amber's transformation answer the central question of guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("meteor hush of captured absences") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure without scaffold or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or figurative muddle; high density ("screaming spectrograms flattened into gentle waves") with propulsion that breathes at the climax; final line recharges "meteor hush" with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief, sound preservation, and tech avoids tropes through verifiable details (amber insect, bespoke firmware); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry via "haunted firmware" premise.</comment>
