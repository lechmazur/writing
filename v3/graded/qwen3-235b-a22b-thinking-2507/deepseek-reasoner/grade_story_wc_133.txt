<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wryly earnest determination" and her shift from solitary threshing to valuing exchange; Alis as memory-conduit avoids ghost tropes but "weary grief across centuries" risks slight abstraction in peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—"first true quiet in her mind"—under Accumulative lens; landslide-to-brooch causality tightens stakes without convenience, reconfiguring meaning through the painting decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal island’s crumbling cliff actively enables the landslide revealing the brooch; rain trails and shale underfoot constrain her movement, charging the final image where she paints "the stark, beautiful terror of two times meeting."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency—choosing to follow rain trails, engage the vision—culminating in the exchange’s cost: her lifelong artistic isolation shattered, foreclosing futile solitude as she paints convergence with steady hands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the brooch’s physicality and final painting; avoids moralizing by having Elara embody "meaning found in transfer," with the convergence image reweighting desiccation as connective tissue rather than loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "bruised hours" and "sodden night"; Alis’s "shifting sand" voice distinct from Elara’s textured interiority; rhythmic control intensifies during the vision with fragmented phrasing mirroring disorientation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "a tiny, captured sun" exemplifies high-density imagery; final line’s "felt no urge to sleep" crystallizes closure without overwriting, though "haggard awe" repetition slightly blurs specificity in one instance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms time-convergence trope through water-war specificity and artistic lens; "thresh meaning from experience" grounds abstraction in pigment-grinding labor, avoiding generic eco-messaging with emotional authenticity in her quiet breakthrough.</comment>
