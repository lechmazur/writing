<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied sorrow as "7.3 grays" avoids label-speak; micro-choice to enter forbidden tower reveals hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. preservation) act simultaneously during deconstruction, earning the refusal with visible cost: dissolved grays becoming understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "sorrow dissolved... into understanding" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—density of sensory details (ozone, pin drop) tightens pressure without causal breaks. Moonlight healing sextant complicates but doesn't resolve; his choice to preserve the maze forecloses deconstruction path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Broken sextant functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("holding a mended instrument"). Its tarnished brass and celestial mechanics constrain choices—must be healed by moonlight to map dreams—making it indispensable to closure's charge. No generic placeholder details; mossy stones and stormlit tower reflect Silas's measured sorrow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (altering sacred maze) escalates through Silas's agency: storm forces tower entry, book discovery fuels hope, pin drop catalyzes action. Tightening occurs when he redirects sextant toward oaks, foreclosing deconstruction with felt cost—quantified sorrow woven into "tapestry of feeling." Coincidence (moonlight) complicates but doesn't solve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: tree rings as silent historians, sorrow as "grays" dissolving into collective memory. Final image ("felt the world witness him back") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence. Epiphany earned via tactile struggle with sextant, not abstract philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "7.3 grays of sorrow" and "polished smooth by routine." Rhythmic compression under pressure ("a pin dropped... impossibly sharp") heightens tension. Voice modulates from measured prose during maintenance to lyrical intensity during epiphany, all within Silas's plausible lexicon—zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "arcanegears frozen shut" shows technical specificity without jargon. Final line ("quiet man... holding a mended instrument") recharges "witness of trees" motif with crystalline clarity. Propulsion flawless: "sorrow pulsed, ticking upward to 7.4" directly sets up dissolution into understanding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "quantified emotion" trope via "grays" measurement and sextant mechanics. "Mundane miracles" tone avoids cliché—moonlight healing brass feels fresh through tree-ring cosmology. Risk-taking (sorrow as part of collective memory) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's emotional charge.</comment>
