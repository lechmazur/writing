<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (childhood obsession intensified by reality fraying) and micro-choice to shift from data to sensory description feel earned, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; emotions are embodied yet insufficiently layered with flaws during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "shadows invert" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("step through" implies risk). Causal lens holds perfectly—sensory description directly triggers the automaton's revelation without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brass automaton and bent spoon function as micro-settings charging closure (spoon's reality-fraying foreshadows shadow inversion), but the observatory doesn't constrain choices beyond atmosphere; "ozone scent" and "mist" brilliantly filter urgency through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elara's agency (switching tactics when data fails), narrowing options to sensory "relearning," but lacks visible price—conceptual cost is legible though not "unmistakable" per band guardrails; escalation remains clean under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "relearn" reframes knowledge as embodied experience, culminating in the resonant final image where shadows "fold into themselves"—no moralizing, though "the path became visible" risks slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("star-stitched void," "gritty metallic sigh") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control shines in frustration beat ("She stopped lecturing..."). Minor register drift in "profound silence" barely avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("relearn" as micro-turn) with crystalline propulsion. Final line ("a time on a clock") avoids figurative muddle, though "profound silence" slightly overreaches without context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of "shadows at noon" as temporal seam feels inevitable through prior details (bent spoon, reality fraying), but floating observatory leans familiar; emotional specificity elevates trope transformation.</comment>
