<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (external map vs internal truth) drives every beat; final renunciation of cartographic validation earned through embodied absorption of forest's emotional lexicon, with cost legible in the compass's shift toward her heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the monolith's revelation reconfigures options (external quest vs internal compass) with conceptual cost ("her internal compass now true"), sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens where vibrational density builds to the stillpoint's crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The Ultrasonic Forest’s hum constrains tactics (only navigable during constellation pause), while the monolith’s physical stillness charges the climax; Elara’s bare feet and skin absorption function as micro-setting that directly enables the emotional mapping climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation through protagonist agency: Elara’s dowsing transforms the forest’s hum into a parseable phrase, narrowing options as harmonization proves her heresy, with cost manifest in the compass’s shift—a tangible reconfiguration of her life’s work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the compass ring’s final tremor toward her heart reweights "greatest territories are of feeling" without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence (Institute’s error vs her truth) while embracing complexity through vibrational grief and joy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—sensory hierarchy filtered through touch/sound ("hum resonated in teeth"), with diction compressing under pressure ("silence was a blanket"); no POV slippage despite lyrical density, though "symphony of feeling" slightly strains voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; "quiet blaze of understanding" risks abstraction but is redeemed by visceral ring-warming; final line’s compression ("silent and complete") achieves high density without muddle, though one borderline metaphor near climax limits 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of blind mapmaker and vibrational absorption feels inevitable—the ultrasonic forest transforms "stillpoint" tropes through tactile specificity, with emotional calculus (patience of stone vs sharp joy) avoiding generic templates while heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
