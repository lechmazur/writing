<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; shift from teacher to conduit occurs externally via broadcast without visible struggle. No micro-choices showing frustration during weeks of "useless" stories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (dust singing with "felt cost" of oppression), but the broadcaster's sign-off feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens. Final image reconfigures meaning cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("air remembering how to speak"), yet ember alcove/mist backdrop remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Misses full 9+ gate by lacking tactical pressure from environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; the "listening" breakthrough arrives via external broadcast rather than her own experimentation. Cost is legible yet not viscerally paid through specific trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—dust as memory, silence as resistance—without moralizing. Final image reweights the famine's cost conceptually ("air itself remembering") while avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (musical metaphors, copyist's precision) with rhythmic control under pressure. "Green glow" motif taught early pays off in dust-sifting scene. Minor deduction for "pulverized literature" slightly exceeding POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "melodic hum, a memory of music trapped within microscopic fragments" compresses theme/action/image. One near-loop in "perpetual mist" repetition prevents 9.0; no artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian tropes via copyist's musical lens, but "teach dust" premise risks quirkiness. Emotional specificity (small tales as resistance) elevates beyond novelty; conceptual integrity strong yet safety middle avoided.</comment>
