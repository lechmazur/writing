<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through concrete embodiment ("sweaty palm," "bruised awe"); micro-choices like clutching the puppet head reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Slight tell in child backstory limits 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with unmistakable cost ("slumped against the console, spent") under Accumulative lens; pressure intensifies via sensory density ("fracturing air," "frantic shuddering") culminating in one decisive deepening. Orientation flawless by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Broken puppet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (triggers singing) and charges final image ("chipped paint and cracked eye"); lighthouse details remain atmospheric rather than tactical, narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: puppet memory forces stance crystallization; cost ("work was never done") legible in final exhaustion. Dominant stake (averting midnight) tightened through sensory deepening, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "beautiful flaws" emerges through puppet's reweighted final image without moralizing; ending offers resonant answer via "bruised awe" at existence's fragility. Avoids thematic echo despite "beautifully flawed" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pane of hush," "bruised awe") with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from frantic to tender. Minor register drift with "vouchsafed" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "beautifully flawed crystal of stopped time" creates slight figurative muddle in high-pressure beat; otherwise impeccable propulsion ("hands pausing their grim advance"). Final paragraph's clarity lifts score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse trope through intimate lens (lullaby for collapsing probabilities); emotional specificity of "imperfect yet utterly real" love avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
