<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing; Silas' "cultivated estrangement" manifests in embodied micro-choices like humming instead of speaking. Flaws (emotional isolation) compound authentically without safety-hedging, driving his pivotal disc-spinning ritual with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final hum crystallizes "endings as sustained notes" with conceptual cost through the disc's accumulated sorrow. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the businessman's "sharp, shaky breath" proves cost legible in the very act of hearing others' endings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The glass disc functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must spin after calls) and charges the final image: its "perfect, balanced note" reweights the tunnel's darkness as fertile ground for beginnings. Sensory specificity ("moistened finger," "amberg light") filters through Silas' purpose without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in endings) tightens through Silas' agency—playing the disc for the businessman transforms abstract fear into tangible resonance. Visible cost manifests in the man's "tentative strength," proving escalation under Accumulative lens without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the disc's evolving resonance; no moralizing. The final image—"sustained note waiting for the next one"—reweights "endings" as preludes without stating a moral, earning resonance through the young woman's courage woven into the ghostly chorus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vein beneath the city's heart," "spectral residue") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in the disc's description: "complex chord of every goodbye" compresses emotional weight without losing clarity, taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels atmosphere or character. The final line—"waited for the next wrong number to ring"—resolves by recharging the disc's motif with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle even in peak lyrical moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the "wrong number" trope through the glass disc's physicality—a fresh synthesis where emotional truth (courage in endings) emerges from specific, verifiable detail. Avoids safety middle by making Silas' isolation integral to his strength.</comment>
