<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete details (talking to gulls, charting tides by instinct); final choice to leave the flower earns isolation's cost through "weight of borrowed memory." Lacks full contradictory impulses in pivotal moment—near miss for 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("weight settled upon him"). Accumulative lens holds: mist and twilight tighten pressure toward cove discovery. Cost proof clear in mantel moment; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal dock/mist functions as micro-setting that constrains movement ("muffling footsteps"); Edelweiss charges final image by charging closure. Environment directly alters tactics—walking beyond dock due to shrouded headlands. Meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding gesture) tighten through Elias' agency—walking beyond dock to cove. Cost legible in "weight" moment. One meaningful escalation (cove discovery) sufficient; no coincidence resolves conflict. Minor deduction for lack of visible trade-off in discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Edelweiss motif: devotion as direction. Final image reweights meaning ("pointing the way home") without stating moral. Avoids sentimentality—insight earned via "struggling patch" and mantel gesture. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "rhythm as softly persistent as water lapping" embodies keeper's world. Rhythmic control under pressure ("mist was a perpetual witness, holding its breath"). Compression taught early (twilight as "uncertain hour"); no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; zero loops. "Papery and grey with age" slightly generic but doesn't dull closure. Final line recharges motif with "connecting the lonely to the lost." Minor deduction for one borderline abstract phrase in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: isolation refracted through opal dock and Alpine flower. Transformation test passed—generic flower would break logic. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes; avoids safety middle via "terrifying clarity" of cove discovery.</comment>
