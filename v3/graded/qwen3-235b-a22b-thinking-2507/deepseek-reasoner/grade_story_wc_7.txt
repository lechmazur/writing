<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—gentle rebellion vs. necessary violence—drive pruning choices; "compassionate editing" crystallizes earned wisdom with felt cost in "screaming chaos" memory wave.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: pruning forecloses wild growth with visible cost (dissipating memories), while final taste reweights "ruins" with conceptual cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse actively constrains choices—threatening glass panels force pruning—and charges the final image where "ruins" birth "symphony," fulfilling 9+ gate via environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: plant's chaotic growth narrows options to urgent pruning, with each snip imposing visceral cost (volcano birth, falling star despair) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "quiet courage of a thousand gentle rebellions" reweights decay/beauty without moralizing, avoiding false binaries through earned resonance in final taste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—taste-focused neurology ("synaptic plasticity")—shapes diction; rhythmic control intensifies during growth explosion ("sudden, silent explosion") without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmering like captured starlight" shows textural specificity. Final line ("symphony—the quiet courage...") crystallizes theme without sentimentality or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion trope transformed via specific neurology and pruning-as-editing metaphor; emotional truth in "compassionate editing" avoids safety middle while deepening thematic stakes.</comment>
