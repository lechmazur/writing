<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "luminous skeptic" trait drives her analytical pilgrimage and earned shift to acceptance; embodied tension in "pulse quickened" and "scientific mind wrestling" avoids abstraction. Minor deduction for underdeveloped physical manifestation of her internal conflict beyond pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "Home was not a place... but a frequency" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost in the star map projection. Accumulative/textural lens holds flawlessly as sensory details coalesce into revelation without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fly amber functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when used as a lens to decode artifacts and charging the fusion moment. "Bronze quiet" motif evolves from scent to emotional state, directly shaping the final image's resonance without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as her analytical motivation ("chemistry of homecoming") collides with the path's mystery, culminating in the cost of her skepticism dissolving. Pressure builds via sensory accumulation rather than external force, consistent with accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the amber lens revealing data/galaxies reframes "homecoming" without moralizing. Final image of footprints leading deeper offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scientific diction ("fractal harmonic," "chemistry of homecoming") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in the closure beat where "bronze-toned convergence" crystallizes voice and theme without syntactic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serpent of moss" and "stream of binary code" achieve high density without muddle. Minor deduction for "scientific mind wrestling" bordering abstraction in a high-pressure beat, though offset by concrete "pulse quickened" proximity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific rigor and spiritual longing through data-as-homecoming; the fly amber micro-sculpture transforms alien contact tropes. Risk-taking in conceptual closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
