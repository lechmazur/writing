<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped; her calm resolve lacks visible tension between vulnerability and competence during the dance sequence. Micro-choices reveal values but without layered irrationality (e.g., no fear-flavored hesitation before the final choice).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (lab flooding) and reconfigured meaning of the die. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly as sensory density tightens pressure toward the final image, though a single micro-turn slightly blurs escalation pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory’s pressure and grating constrain every choice, charging the final image as Elara rises through water. The hangman’s dice shifts from execution tool to key, proving environment and object-as-setting meet 9+ gate by concretely shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Accumulative/Textural pressure (groaning ocean, tightening time), but "calm defiance" remains thematic rather than altering tactics—her dance method isn’t jeopardized by panic, missing a visceral trade-off that would deepen the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (vulnerability as strength via dance decoding), avoiding moralizing. Final image of the warm die reweights "execution" into "key" with conceptual cost, though "greatest strength" edges toward stated wisdom without full subtextual ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Elara’s sensorium filters through code-breaking rhythm ("feeling their hidden music"). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (slow extensions vs. sharp turns), with no head-hopping or register drift despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops or figurative muddle; sentences like "water burst from seams in the ceiling" propel with textural specificity. Minor abstraction in "translating encrypted sorrow into motion" slightly dulls one high-pressure beat, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the "trapped knowledge" trope through embodied dance-as-code-breaking and the die’s conceptual repricing. Risk-taking (lyrical action over dialogue) heightens stakes coherently, with the sunken lab’s specificity anchoring emotional truth in physical constraint.</comment>
