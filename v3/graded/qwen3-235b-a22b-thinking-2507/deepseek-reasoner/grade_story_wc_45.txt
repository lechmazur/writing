<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s "forgiving skepticism" drives contradictory impulses—relief for her son clashing with recognition of the Fae’s grief—culminating in the earned, costly tooth exchange. No diagnostic labels; embodied emotion ("relief was a tidal wave, but it crashed against the rock of the creature's grief") grounds the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: returning the tooth forecloses simple victory, reconfiguring the changeling premise through the final image of carrying "a star in her hand." Causal lens holds tightly; the bone-setting act directly enables the moral trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The silver blossom isn’t decorative—it supplies the literal path home, while the baby tooth’s physical handling constrains Elara’s choice. Sensory details like fireflies pulsing "with the rhythm of a heartbeat" filter through her shrewd innocence, charging the garden’s pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven solely by Elara’s agency: her journey, bone-setting offer, and tooth exchange narrow options to a single, costly trade-off. The tightening at the climax—"reached not for her son, but for the cord"—makes the moral price viscerally legible under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action, not moralizing: the tooth’s reweighting from "token of failure" to "part of your story" crystallizes the non-literal answer to loss. Final image avoids sentimentality by framing understanding as "a wiser, more generous kind of knowing" earned through sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in precise, character-particular details: Elara notices the Fae’s "opalescent" tooth and "painful stiffness," not generic sorrow. Syntax modulates under pressure—short, urgent phrases in the maze; flowing cadence in the garden—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story or character. Figurative language ("certainty cleft cleanly in two") is precise and pressure-appropriate. Final line recharges the opening’s "cleft" motif with crystalline clarity, avoiding overwriting even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the changeling trope through specific emotional calculus: the bone-setting as cross-species empathy and the tooth’s dual symbolism feel inevitable. Risks moral ambiguity without safety-hedging—the Fae’s loss isn’t redeemed, yet the resolution deepens both characters’ humanity.</comment>
