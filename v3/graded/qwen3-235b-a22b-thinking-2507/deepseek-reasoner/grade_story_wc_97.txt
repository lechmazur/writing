<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("steely longing" vs. grief-forged resolve) drives choices, but micro-choices lack deeper value hierarchy beyond the central obsession. Final renunciation of reversal for an "encore" earns cost through the fleeting echo, though emotional complexity remains surface-layer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the horizon's violet bleed crystallizes stakes with visceral cost ("before the night fully embraced the sky"). Accumulative lens holds via density escalation—film flickers to compass glow to grove ignition—reweighting "surprise fate" with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arbor’s gaseous flora and cloud-stuff platforms constrain tactics (syncing clock to tidal rhythm), while the broken clock’s frozen hands charge the final image as hands "weave light and time." Micro-setting as essential pressure, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: compasses narrow path choices, horizon’s approach tightens temporal stakes. Cost crystallizes in the echo’s fleeting grace—"not a reversal, but an encore"—with visible trade-off against encroaching night under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through film’s hidden frames and compasses’ "different north," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "surprise fate" as a conceptual repricing: the encore’s grace holds meaning only because night’s cost is imminent, resonating without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fingers tracing melodies... as familiar as lines on her palms" filters all details through pianist’s tactile memory. Rhythmic control modulates from fluid piano to "strategically creative" urgency, with elision (husband’s absence) taught early and paid in grove ignition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but high-pressure beats risk density ("luminous, gaseous flora that pulsed and swayed with a rhythm as old as time") bordering on overwriting without pattern payoff. Final image clarity prevents severe deduction; scaffold-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via specific mechanics: flickering compasses as cartography of love, film splices as memory map. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—the tidal arbor’s rhythm isn’t metaphor but functional clock sync—without gimmickry.</comment>
