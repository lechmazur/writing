<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "war between duty and need to know"; embodied conflict via "hammer against ribs" and "snap like gunshot" avoids diagnostic labels. Final choice earned through prior causality but micro-choice hierarchy lacks nuance at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "thick with echo of her action" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies through "chime, soft as a sigh" sequence. One tightening (network activation) sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Snow-frozen library constrains every choice: thermal gloves enable handling, crystalline cases hide contraband. Final thawing snow recharges setting’s meaning. Sensory hierarchy (breath pluming, servo-rack maintenance panel) perfectly filters through archivist’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence vs truth) tightens via single pressure point: feeding letter into network. Cost is legible in "pale faces and exchanged glances"—conceptual price paid. Agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens, though secondary stake (personal safety) lacks sufficient on-page test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "contraband truths" motif reweighted by final thawing snow. Avoids moralizing; "doubt was the most dangerous thing" resonates non-literally. Slight tell in "provoked an unspoken conversation" edges toward thematic echo but redeemed by concrete execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through archivist’s tactile focus ("thermal gloves," "servo-units"). Rhythmic control shifts from measured ("vault of knowledge") to staccato ("snap that echoed like a gunshot") under pressure. Zero head-hopping; elision of backstory taught via "decades dead" cue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Propulsion flawless until "her own truth now another piece of contraband"—"now" introduces filter-verb leakage. Otherwise, high density: "digital ghost she set loose to haunt" does triple duty. No figurative muddle; final snow image avoids cliché through concrete "imperceptibly, to thaw."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian trope via micro-setting specificity (cryo-archive mechanics) and emotional truth in quiet rebellion. "Scandal without riots" is fresh inflection; snow’s dual role (preserver/thawing agent) synthesizes theme. Avoids safety-middle through morally ambiguous complicity.</comment>
