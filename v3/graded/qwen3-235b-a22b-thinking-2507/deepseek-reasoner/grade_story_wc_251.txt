<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels ("resigned acceptance" embodied in slumped shoulders); contradictory impulses (teaching vs. rebellion) drive the cradle action with visible cost in Leo's shift from defeat to relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Leo’s "I see it now" crystallizes the stance shift with felt cost ("rigid posture softened... relief of understanding"), sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens via sensory density (winking displays, starlight).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt library mist and starlight constrain choice (whispers only in quiet); the "magnetic grotto" image charges closure by transforming resignation into possibility, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mr. Aris’ agency (organizing displays), narrowing Leo’s resignation into divergent paths; cost is emotional (doubt → hope) but lacks tangible consequence, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "forests of second thoughts" motif reweighted at closure; avoids moralizing by showing ("move is yours") not telling, though "prophecy" line flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amplified quiet," "cobalt library") sustains Accumulative lens; rhythm modulates with stress (short phrases during displays), but "magnetic grotto" slightly disrupts lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cradling the rebellion" exemplifies layered prose. Minor overwriting in "magnetic grotto" (forced lyricism) dulls climax cadence, preventing 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "humble rebellion" via town-wide chess displays; emotional specificity (cradling resolve, not congratulating) elevates tropes, but premise lacks fresh angle beyond lyrical execution.</comment>
