<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied retrocognition (cold floor showing past warmth); micro-choices under pressure—tracing star paths with ghosts of astronomers—reveal hierarchy of values. No second character, so relationship bullets waived; flaw is slight over-articulation in "defiant little weed" metaphor risking stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "custodian of a new kind of beacon" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (abandoning restoration for fractured celebration). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; density increase at convergence reweights stake. Cost proof: "not restored the past. She had rekindled a possibility" shows irrevocable shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass Humming Pavilion functions as micro-setting that charges final image—walls become galaxy, prism emits "sound of light." Sensory hierarchy impeccable: wind’s hum, liquid silver glow, "thistle-blown hope" tactile detail. Constraints choice via geometry focusing starlight; recurring prism fractures directly shape climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences matter) tightens via celestial convergence, narrowing options to one night. Escalation driven by agency: Elara’s tracking forces stance crystallization. Cost legible—"prism was not whole" accepts imperfection—but lacks visible tactical loss (e.g., physical toll). Coincidence complicates (star alignment) but doesn’t resolve; her action creates the meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "scattered, stellar light" reweights "coincidences have meaning" without moralizing. Final image (celebrating "little lights") offers resonant answer to collapse’s silence. Avoids thematic echo; "shard of hush" charged by prism’s new sound. Complexity intact—no false balance, yet embraces fragility as strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: retrocognition filters all description ("cold glass warmed under her touch"). Rhythmic control peaks during convergence—"terrible moment... faint glow pulsed"—compressing stress without voice drift. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "past whispered as sensation." No dialogue, so relevant bullets waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("vein of liquid silver" does triple duty: image, emotion, plot). Propulsion flawless—"wind’s hum was the only sound" breathes with scene. Figurative language sparse but precise ("thistle-blown hope"); no muddle in climax. Final line’s "refused to be swallowed" recharges opening’s "defiant little weed" with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "broken beacon" trope via retrocognition as embodied philosophy. "Shard of hush" concept freshens post-apocalyptic silence; "coincidences have meaning" made visceral through star paths. Risk-taking (accumulative lens over causal) heightens stakes—closure hinges on reconfiguration, not restoration. Emotional specificity avoids generic hope; "celebrated little lights" feels inevitable yet unexpected.</comment>
