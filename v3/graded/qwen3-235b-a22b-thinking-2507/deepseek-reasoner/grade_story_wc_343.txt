<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "diligently curious" nature drives concrete micro-choices (sketching hopscotch) under pressure; contradictory impulses manifest in sociable isolation versus absorption. Final renunciation of traditional cartography feels earned by prior causality, though internal conflict could deepen slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara's folded phrasebook dog-ear crystallizes her shift from apprentice to pioneer with visible cost (abandoning Guild expectations). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as pattern density reweights stakes, though violinist's convenience slightly undermines causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hopscotch board and phrasebook constrain choices and charge the final image (new dog-ear), while starlings mirror the resonance pattern. Airship setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical; "dusty" texture vitalizes the key object but environmental pressure on decisions is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stranded ship) tightens via Elara's pattern recognition, narrowing options to one sequence. Cost is legible in her shifted identity, but violinist's convenient arrival edges toward coincidence resolving conflict, slightly diluting agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "unseen geographies of energy" reweights cartography through concrete action (hopscotch→music). Final image of folded phrasebook offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; complexity in balancing tradition with discovery avoids false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("grammar of wind, syntax of stone") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in starling descriptions; psychic distance shifts intentionally during crystal reactivation. No head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grammar><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "frozen tear" metaphor clarifies crystal's state without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop ("sociable isolation" repeated verbatim) triggers −0.2. Final line’s "bright strand woven back" achieves textural specificity with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking, resonance physics, and children's play feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in Elara's quiet triumph avoids generic templates; "dusty hopscotch board" as key mechanism transforms trope through lived detail without gimmickry.</comment>
