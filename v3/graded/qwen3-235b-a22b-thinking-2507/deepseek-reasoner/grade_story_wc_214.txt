<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aris’s stillness-seeking vs. starfall vulnerability; embodied cost when he "felt the star’s death as his own" avoids epiphany clichés through physical tremors and breathlessness, not abstract labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: his "shaken" vulnerability reconfigures purpose ("not merely to preserve silence, but to listen"), validated by the Accumulative lens where meteor observations deepen into soul-jolting empathy, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The yellow glass constrains every choice—replacing computers for star-tracing—and charges the final image ("pooling around him"), transforming micro-setting into thematic engine; sensory details like "dust motes dancing in dead monitors" anchor urgency without checklist padding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Aris’s agency: his choice to use the glass (not computers) for star-tracing crystallizes into empathetic cost ("soul jolt"), narrowing options from passive observer to witness; conceptual cost ("vulnerability showed terrifying truth") reweights the climax without physical action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—the glass’s distortion reframing cosmic violence as "birth of light"—avoiding moralizing; the final line ("tracing the beautiful, burning paths home") resonates as non-literal answer to "flourishing stillness," no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kingdom of dust motes," "buttery, distorted squares") modulates rhythm under stress: short, fragmented syntax during the meteor shock ("He wasn’t just watching...") mirrors his fractured state, no POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "primal elegance" avoids abstraction by tying to glass-pooling imagery; final line’s cadence ("forever tracing...") propels closure without figurative muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "janitor epiphany" trope through cosmic lens: "flourishing stillness" redefined as active listening, not passivity; emotional specificity in vulnerability’s "terrifying heat" avoids generic templates, though era-setting lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
