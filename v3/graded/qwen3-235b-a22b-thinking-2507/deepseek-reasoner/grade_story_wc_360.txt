<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (mathematical precision vs. emotional yearning) drives authentic micro-choices, notably slamming the lever to survive the emotional deluge. Embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak through visceral metaphors like "drowning in a sea of borrowed lives," though "psychic vertigo" slightly edges toward abstraction without immediate concrete anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a valid Charged Poise: the spent halo fragment and Aris's realization ("language to be lived") reconfigure the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—the stars withdrawing due to universal emotional atrophy. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; pressure tightens through the intensifying emotional flood without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The topaz geode actively constrains choice by embodying the miner's crystallized despair, which Aris then experiences during the flood. The letterpress itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—the "vacant, star-dusted black" vellum directly stems from the press mechanics and reweights the entire experiment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven purely by Aris's agency: his deliberate ambiguity choice triggers the emotional storm, forcing the lever-slamming renunciation. The visible cost—his dissolved personas and the stars' withdrawal—is unmistakable in the final line's "exquisite ache of his own heart," reweighting the dominant stake (authenticity vs. quantification) under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the "circle of vacant, star-dusted black" vellum embodies the "emotional signature of loss," rejecting mathematical solutions for lived language. Theme emerges solely through concrete actions—the press operation, the spent fragment—avoiding any moralizing while charging the stars' withdrawal with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in technical letterpress terms ("chase," "vellum") blending with emotional precision ("psychic vertigo" redeemed by immediate examples). Rhythmic control modulates perfectly under pressure: fragmented syntax during the flood ("He was himself, but also the lonely miner...") contrasts with the calm final line's lyrical weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "a circle of vacant, star-dusted black" which simultaneously delivers image, theme, and closure. Figurative language avoids muddle— "drowning in a sea of borrowed lives" intensifies pressure without overwriting. Final line's "exquisite ache" recharges the opening "ache" with devastating specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mechanics as emotional conduit avoids trope pitfalls; the stellar vanishing as metaphor for emotional atrophy feels inevitable through grounded details (topaz geode, star-silver pigment). Risk-taking (accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the "mathematics of emotion" premise slightly edges toward familiar territory despite strong execution.</comment>
