<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (examining dust vs. cataloging damage) and embodied emotion ("breath catching"), but neutron-star expertise isn't leveraged beyond initial setup, slightly weakening causality for the epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("patient, and finally, quiet") crystallizes the cost of abandoning sterile quantification with undeniable pressure; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly as dust patterns reweight the flood's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (forcing observational shift) and charges the final image; "bent aluminum tables" and "thorn" tactically pressure her actions, though "waterlogged grief" borders on overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating dust patterns narrows her options from sterile quantification to humbled acceptance; the cost ("drama was never needless") is unmistakable in the final realization that reconfigures the flood's meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through dust patterns and stellar decay parallels; the final line ("written in dust and light") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cosmologist’s search for pattern") with rhythmic control (staccato "drip-drip-drip" to lyrical "patient, accidental artistry"); zero head-hopping as voice modulates from clinical to awed under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("This dust from a butterfly wing was the artist" does triple duty), but "waterlogged grief" risks figurative muddle in an otherwise pristine opening beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via scientific lens (butterfly dust as cosmic metaphor); "infinitesimal air currents" specificity avoids quirkiness, making emotional truth feel earned through lived detail.</comment>
