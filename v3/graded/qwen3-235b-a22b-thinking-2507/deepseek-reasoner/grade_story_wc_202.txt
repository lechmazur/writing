<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I didn't want to just observe; I needed to release the story" during the climax. Motivation ("honor overlooked histories") drives every micro-choice, with embodied emotion avoiding cliché except a borderline "cold knot" phrase.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "I was no longer just a translator... but a keeper of their light" with undeniable cost in identity shift. Accumulative lens holds perfectly, though the transition to the artist's stall ("a compulsion seized me") edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Market's "ozone, rare herbs, metallic tang" constrains discovery, while the painting's rocky cove directly enables the climax—environment shapes every pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: lens reveals warning, compulsion to "unfasten the truth" escalates to identity-altering absorption. Cost is unmistakable in "the anchor held fast" reconfiguration, with no coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lighthouse keeper's daughter's story—no moralizing, just the resonant final line reweighting "translator" as "keeper of their light." Avoids false equivalence by honoring specific overlooked history without redemption arcs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cartographer of the spaces between what is said" with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor slip: "fear a cold knot" flirts with bodily cliché but stays specific enough to avoid penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ozone, rare herbs, metallic tang" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line "keeper of their light" recharges the opening metaphor with crystalline clarity—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope through specific thematic purpose: lens enables honoring overlooked histories, not plot convenience. Emotional truth in "keeper of their light" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking heightening stakes.</comment>
