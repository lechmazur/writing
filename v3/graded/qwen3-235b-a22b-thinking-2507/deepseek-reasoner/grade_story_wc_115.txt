<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skeptic chasing supernatural truth) drives physical action; final choice to turn valve earned by need to "appraise validity," with cost in "slumped against warm boiler" showing embodied exhaustion and conceptual burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density until valve turn triggers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis); cost crystallized in "immense, quiet burden of absolution" with physical slump proving legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (beaded valve wheel) constrains choice and charges closure—cold beads under fingers versus slumping against warm boiler reweights "swallowed truth" as tangible burden; sensory hierarchy narrows under stress ("drip of water... like footsteps").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency under accumulative lens: "appraise validity" evolves from intellectual quest to physical strain against fused valve, with visible cost in "muscles burning" and final exhaustion reconfiguring truth's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through valve’s physicality—"weight of history" becomes "burden of absolution"—avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "swallowed truth" as visceral cost without abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness," "paradoxical blend") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical opening to staccato climax ("He grunted... it budged"), with radio backstory taught early as patterned elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("bone-deep fatigue and hyper-vigilant focus") propels without muddle; "colossal sigh of stale steam... force of a final, released breath" crystallizes closure with resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via skeptic’s tactile quest for truth’s weight; "beaded valve wheel" as specific, irreplaceable object synthesizes theme and stakes, avoiding abstraction through lived detail.</comment>
