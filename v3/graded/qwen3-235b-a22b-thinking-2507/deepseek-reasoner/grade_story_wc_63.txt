<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s dual life (keeper of time/secrets), but the "mistake no one remembered" lacks concrete causality, slightly weakening the climax’s motivation despite embodied emotions like "cold, sharp-toothed surf" clarifying her mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when Elara stops the clock, crystallizing her refusal with undeniable conceptual cost ("time itself in Selthorne was now unmoored"), though the abrupt shift from dragging the bob to leaving it risks slight causality slippage in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (volcanic glass crunching, surf resistance) and charges the final image of the abandoned bob, while the rake handle’s notches transform from tally to thematic anchor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency as the pendulum bob’s discovery forces a trade-off (repair vs. reveal), but the "shared responsibility" resolution leans slightly abstract; the visceral cost of dragging the bob anchors escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the notches, the stopped clock—avoiding moralizing, though "restore shared balance" risks slight abstraction; the final image reweights "incremental absolution" into instantaneous truth without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("volcanic glass," "brass pendulum’s apex") modulates with pressure, and rhythmic control shifts from measured prose to fragmented urgency during the bob retrieval, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "ethically diligent weight that bent her shoulders" slightly overwrites physicality; high density persists even in peak beats like "cold a shock that clarified her mission," though minor figurative muddle touches escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms clock-winder trope through the tidal absolution ritual and irreversible stoppage, with specificity ("broken rake handle," "obsidian ridge") creating freshness; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry as the clock’s silence becomes the ultimate reconfiguration.</comment>
