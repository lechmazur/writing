<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied micro-choices: the shift from "prune" instinct to "feeling what the wood would allow" reveals her hierarchy of values. Avoids epiphany clichés, though "circuitously sincere" slightly abstracts emotion without immediate physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the loosened "knot of anxiety" and waiting for the next storm crystallize stance crystallization with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure tightens via sensory density ("moss knitted splintered wood," "roses straining") without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mossy trellis constrains every choice: its splintered state forces adaptive rebuilding, while the linden leaf evolves from specimen to symbol. Final image ("dripping green," "scent of petrichor") charges closure by reweighting the storm’s meaning through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is pure Accumulative: the dominant stake (control vs. adaptation) deepens via sensory accumulation ("leaves mulch the soil," "roses straining") rather than external events. Elara’s agency in releasing control narrows options decisively, with cost legible in "her roots digging deeper into a truth."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through action: the reconstructed trellis ("stronger, weirder, more beautiful") embodies adaptive resilience without moralizing. Final image ("thunder... a deep and welcoming sound") reweights the storm as "partner" through concrete particulars, avoiding any thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-specific ("hydrotropism," "thigmomorphogenesis" blurred by rain) yet never clinical. Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato during storm ("sky tore open"), lyrical in reflection ("resilient, adaptive life")—with zero register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "knot of anxiety in her chest had loosened" compresses emotional shift without abstraction. Figurative language ("bead of water like an emerald specimen") serves character and closure. Final line’s "charged air" crystallizes Charged Poise with maximum propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids nursery-owner clichés by making botany integral to conflict: the trellis rebuild isn’t metaphor but literal constraint. Transformation test passes—swap "nursery" for "office," and the emotional arc collapses. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
