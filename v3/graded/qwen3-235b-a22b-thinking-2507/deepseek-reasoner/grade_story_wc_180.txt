<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s embodied grief-turned-determination; Lyra’s "feisty spirit" manifests through active dialogue that alters tactics. Minor deduction: fleeting "anger softening into wonder" lacks layered contradiction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density (shattered glass, orchard perfume) escalates to Charged Poise closure where fractured light reconfigures stakes. Cost is visceral in "splinters and dust" and the ribbon’s transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard actively constrains choice (climbing pillars, using river stone) and charges the final image—rainbows dancing on mossy walls. Micro-setting mastery: quartz shards and ribbon directly shape the lens creation, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: grinding quartz redefines "vision" as fractured possibility. Cost is legible in the destroyed workshop and her shift from Guild-perfection to "quiet determination." One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—deciduous oak leaf informing "vows that fall away"—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("seeing *differently*") resonates without stating the thesis; cost is conceptual (broken contract vs. unbroken light).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "scent of shattered glass," "perfume of ripe fruit" filter through Elara’s mender lens. Minor deduction: Lyra’s dialogue slightly over-articulates ("I heard what they did") for high-stress reunion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "coiled like a pale serpent" elevates without muddle. Deduction for adjacent paraphrase loop: "fractured light into a spectrum of possibilities" / "chaotic, beautiful mosaic of light" in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "deciduous vows" with lenscraft avoids tropes; cathedral orchard feels lived-in, not whimsical. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal turns) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—closure remains undeniable.</comment>
