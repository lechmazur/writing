<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (containment vs release) through embodied choices; Kael’s pressure crystallizes Elara’s shift without flattening her struggle. Micro-choice placing nautilus against star earns the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "weight of impending loss replaced by profound density" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through spiral pattern to irreversible revaluation. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nautilus shell constrains choice (resonance focus → release conduit) and charges final image ("thrumming with satisfied warmth"). Ember Nexus’ perpetual twilight evolves from static backdrop to "softer, kinder" space reflecting transformed stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: containment failure → revaluing purpose forecloses imprisonment path. Cost legible in "weight of impending loss replaced by profound density"—conceptual shift alters her identity as alchemist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through spiral motif: final image of "memory and promise" reweights transformation without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in concrete action ("midwife to its becoming").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via alchemist’s lexicon ("resonance focus," "tuning hymn"); rhythm modulates from frantic to deep pulse under pressure. No head-hopping, but "scientifically romantic" phrase slightly drifts POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fear evaporated, replaced by a palette of resolve" layers acceptance/courage/grace). Final beat’s "let go with love" risks abstraction but anchors to concrete image ("room held... beginning").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of logarithmic spirals as transformation physics avoids trope. Risk-taking (redefining alchemy as midwifery) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight derivative echo in "scientifically romantic" caps near-9.5.</comment>
