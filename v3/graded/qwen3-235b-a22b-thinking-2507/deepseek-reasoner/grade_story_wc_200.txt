<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: Contradictory impulses (fear as "tunable frequency" vs. pursuing joy) manifest in micro-choices like tooth adjustments; embodied emotion via "luminous ache" and spirit's "rusty" laughter mechanism. Weakness: Spirit's interiority remains underdeveloped beyond sorrow/regret, limiting emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where laughter's dissolution into sunlight reweights the gorge's purpose with felt cost—Elara's "luminous ache... felt lighter." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation, though harp mechanics' causal link to soul release slightly strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: Echo Gorge's resonant walls necessitate distortion (not correction) of the harp, directly shaping tactics. Final image ("sunlight flooding the gorge") charges closure by transforming the canyon from "deep stone silence" to "resonance." Minor drag in sap description mid-beat slightly stalls momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally through distortion's "vibrating wave of wrongness" forcing the spirit's confusion-to-laughter progression, with visible cost in Elara's emotional shift. Agency is clear (tuning choices), but the spirit's transformation lacks sufficient struggle—confusion resolves too swiftly without deeper resistance to joy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: laughter as "final, perfect confession" reweights the spirit's life without moralizing. Final image ("resonance, a promise that even here, laughter could find a way") offers non-literal answer. Slight sentimentality in "blessing" and "hopeful light" edges toward thematic neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "fractured echoes" and "flat, jarring thrum," with rhythm modulating from tense fragments ("It was a hiccup") to flowing release ("cascade of pure joy"). Near-label "modestly fearless" slightly dilutes embodied voice in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("confession, whispered on the looping breeze" advances character/setting/conflict). Minor figurative muddle in "brilliant, white-hot radiance" risks cliché, but closure beat ("laughter lingering like a blessing") remains clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "misaligned harp" as healing tool transforms trope through specific mechanics (enhancing distortion). Risk-taking in textural escalation pays off—laughter's physical "hiccup" progression feels fresh. Gorge setting leans slightly generic but redeemed by harp's crystalline sap detail.</comment>
