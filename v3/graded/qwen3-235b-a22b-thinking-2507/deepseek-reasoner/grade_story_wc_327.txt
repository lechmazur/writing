<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—harnessing the diamond that torments her—drive the climax; her micro-choice to accept dissonance earns closure through prior causality (bird patterns as calibration) with visible cost in enduring painful echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: the canyon’s "full and complete" silence reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (enduring "wail of loss"), anchored by Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density peaks during the symphony’s creation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bone towers actively constrain choice—they multiply echoes essential to translation—while the diamond’s flaw charges the final image as "warm and settled," transforming setting from obstacle to vessel for cultural preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: the diamond’s dissonance amplifies trauma, forcing her to weave pain into harmony, with felt cost in "the harsh silence of a final breath" altering her tactics toward integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through texture-to-sound translation; the final "silent song" reweights silence as fulfillment without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo by grounding wisdom in the diamond’s transformation from malice to "captured starlight."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("watched the sky for bird patterns") and rhythmic control—staccato during dissonance, lyrical for the symphony—modulate under pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "frozen lightning bolt" avoids overwriting, but "malice of its own" slightly abstracts before redemption; zero loops, with final line recharging "echo" motif through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cultural preservation via sonic texture—copper veins conducting memory, curse as necessary vessel—avoids tropes through specific stakes (translating "grit of desert wind") and bold lyric structure.</comment>
