<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation ("quiet compulsion to seek joy beneath anguish") drives concrete micro-choices (tracing goggles, unfolding packet) with embodied emotion. Final renunciation of servant silence is earned through prior observation skills, though contradictory impulses lack deeper friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: man’s laughter-memory reconfigures "joy beneath anguish" with visible cost ("shoulders began to shake"). Accumulative lens holds through floor-by-floor escalation, and the sunbeam’s timing avoids coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains choice—cloud cover blocks light until critical sunbeam refracts through goggles. Final image charged by spire’s "less cold" transformation, proving environment’s necessity beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (joy in anguish) tightens via Accumulative pressure: each floor deepens diary’s emotional weight. Kael’s agency (placing objects/unfolding packet) forces man’s stance crystallization with palpable cost in trembling hands and remembered laughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: smiley face in waxed paper reweights "joy woven through anguish" without moralizing. Final image ("thread of gold in grey cloth") delivers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost crystals bloom," brass fittings traced) modulates rhythm under pressure. Compression taught early ("fifth floor... seventh floor") pays off in closure; no head-hopping despite dual character focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic light touched, metallic ink shimmered" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only minor flaw: "warmly inquisitive" told not shown, but avoids peak-beat dilution. Final line recharges motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms servant trope via specific mechanics (light-refraction diary). Emotional truth in quiet connection avoids sentimentality, though risk-taking stops short of full structural boldness. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
