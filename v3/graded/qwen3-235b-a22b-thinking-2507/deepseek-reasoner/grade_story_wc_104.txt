<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "raw, circular impressions" versus "staggering grace," but motivation ("plant resilience") edges toward abstraction without deeper conflict. Final self-imprisonment earns closure through visible cost of freedom for seed protection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: piano key sorting deepens pressure through pattern recognition, culminating in Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "her own prison was now the vault’s protection"—freedom sacrificed for hope. Minor arrow-strength convenience doesn’t undermine escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Carnival setting vividly anchors atmosphere (mildewed plush toys, skee-ball lanes) but fails 9+ gate: environment doesn’t constrain choices beyond piano discovery. Dusty arcade backdrop enhances tone yet remains observational rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("buy time for seed-bearers"), with militia arrival tightening pressure under Accumulative lens. Escalation driven by Elara’s key-sorting agency, culminating in undeniable cost: "locked in" for seed preservation. No coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"plant resilience in dry soil" reweighted by final image of kneeling amid seeds as world burns. Avoids moralizing; "library of life" crystallizes hope without abstraction. Slight thematic echo in "resilience" phrasing prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice distinct in sensory texture ("grit-strewn concrete," "out-of-tune piano"), but filter-verb stacks ("she could hear shouted orders") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature strong, yet rhythmic control falters during militia arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose generally lean but suffers minor loops: "staggering grace" repeated verbatim, and "silent, powerful motion born of desperation" borders on template cadence. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet density dips in bootstep descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes via specific details (paper-fletched arrow, piano key puzzle). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though carnival setting leans familiar. "Library of life" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
