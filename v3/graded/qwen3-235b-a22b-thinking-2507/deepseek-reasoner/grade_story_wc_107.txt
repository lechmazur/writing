<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "weighty lightness" and micro-choice of placing the bookmark on the console, but "cold anger" lacks prior embodied evidence before the pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—"thawed and beating heart, ready to feel the sun’s warmth directly"—under Accumulative lens, though ice-sheet shattering borders on coincidental pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned control room functions as micro-setting: the ice-bound window directly constrains time pressure and charges the final image when sunlight transforms the bookmark’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the thaw’s live clock ("race against this melt"), with the ice-sheet shatter forcing her realization; cost is legible in the "violent, cracking" emotional thaw foreclosing her icy armor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass/orb metaphor without moralizing; the final image of the bookmark as "testament" reweights prior loss into resilience, answering the central question through charged specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct (glassblower’s heat/light focus), but "thoughtfully spirited" drifts into label-speak; rhythmic control during glassblowing sequence modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmering tears traced paths" exemplifies textural specificity. Only minor register drift in "spirit was thoughtfully spirited" slightly dulls immediacy in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "thaw as renewal" trope through glassblower’s craft: "safe zones for inquiry" concept gains freshness via tangible stakes; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
