<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via logbook clutching and terrace hesitation; "feathery determination solidified into steel" embodies contradictory impulses. Leo's dialogue crystallizes relationship-as-crucible without sentimentality. Minor flaw: "fragile persistent thing" borders on abstract label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "fractured world waiting beyond... no longer a threat" reconfigures stakes through earned emotional shift. Orientation perfect by word 15 ("fractured hush"). Prism transition slightly undermotivated but terrace-to-ground collapse satisfies Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: furniture grain map constrains choices and charges final image. Corn maze→energy walls evolution mirrors emotional arc. "Dusty eyes" farmhouse window anchors early, but "crystalline light" terrace lacks tactile constraint beyond visual pattern.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Leo via threshold logic) tightens through logbook→grain analysis shift. Agency-driven escalation peaks when codes become emotional map. Missing visible price paid during terrace analysis; stakes slightly abstract until path solidifies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "sanctuary built from love and logic" crystallized through Leo's drawings, not statement. Final image reweights "fractured hush" into "peaceful core" with conceptual cost. Avoids moralizing despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Architect POV shapes every perception ("paths of her own greatest creation"). Rhythmic control peaks during terrace scene: "stepping into a rainbow’s heart" compresses stress without losing specificity. Zero voice convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured hush" echoes structurally without redundancy. "Soft golden light" slightly generic but redeemed by immediate functional purpose (path center). Final line avoids sentimentality through active verb "mend".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via corn maze physics: emotional weather codes feel fresh yet inevitable. "Necessary distances" concept grounds magic in architectural logic. Butterfly effect reference borders on cliché but redeemed by execution.</comment>
