<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied grief in "slumping forward" and tactile discovery of mosaic fractures earns epiphany. Minor deduction: brother's absence as motivator slightly abstract despite concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "ambiguous loss remained... but its weight felt different" reweights the entire premise. Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation to stance crystallization at the mosaic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cavern orchard constrains choice via dripping water's timing and mosaic's physicality; "resonant soil" jars charge final image. Near-miss for 9+: setting enables tactics but doesn't actively pressure mid-scene decisions beyond the central ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when data reveals "hollow zero," deepening into conceptual reweighting. Agency is fully Elara's: her despair and tactile discovery drive the shift. Cost is visceral in "wave of despair" and reframed grief's "fragile but tenacious" emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mosaic fractures as "physical history" reconfigures "mathematics of emotion" without moralizing. Final image—"letting the numbers sing the story"—resonantly answers the central question through earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mineral-rich water broke the silence" and "shimmering thread" diction. Minor rhythmic drag in "her purpose gently reinvented" phrasing slightly blurs emotional intensity during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "fractures weren't random damage—they were a record." Deduction: "wave of despair" edges toward bodily cliché in high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific alchemy: mathematics as love's cartography. "Shape of what was missing" crystallizes emotional truth without abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes while maintaining conceptual clarity.</comment>
