<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through micro-choices: forge repurposed for pitons, silent focus as grief embodiment. Contradictory impulses (meekness vs. unbreakable will) act simultaneously in puppet-weaving climax. Final choice earned by preparation; cost legible in silk’s dissolution without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands cleanly: "ribbon of blue defiance" reconfigures options with felt cost (silk puppet’s dissolution). Causal lens holds firmly through descent→discovery→dilemma→solution chain. Minor under-foreshadowing of lichen’s trade mechanics slightly dulls cost legibility at peak beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s dying soil and arches as "tombstones" constrain choice by motivating mine descent. Crystalline cavern’s light beam enables lichen visibility, directly charging climax. Final image’s "ribbon of blue" against stone reweights setting with irreversible cost—environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Causal escalation: lichen’s "bartered awakening" rule forces impossible choice. Elara’s agency drives solution (puppet creation), with cost unmistakable in silk’s dissolution. Slight convenience in lichen mechanics slightly softens pressure legibility, but trade-off forecloses self-sacrifice path decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "azure defiance" reweighted from thought to silk to final sky image—no moralizing. "Coaxed resilience from rubble" resonates as earned answer to dying-world question via concrete action. Final line’s quiet will reconfigures premise without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: blacksmith notices "pitons," geologist’s "worn page of notes." Syntax tightens under stress ("Days blurred... dimming glow-lamp"). Final line’s cadence ("not with noise, but with...") mirrors her quiet resolve. Zero POV leakage; voice modulates perfectly with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "azure defiance" recurs with reweighted meaning. Climax prose crystallizes action: "wove the silk into a complex, makeshift puppet" avoids muddle. Final line’s rhythm ("unbreakable will") propels closure without figurative clutter. Every sentence advances character or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms rescue trope through meek blacksmith’s craft-based solution—puppet exchange feels inevitable. "Azure defiance" as quiet resistance synthesizes setting/theme uniquely. Risk-taking (rejecting self-sacrifice) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in grief-as-focus avoids generic templates.</comment>
