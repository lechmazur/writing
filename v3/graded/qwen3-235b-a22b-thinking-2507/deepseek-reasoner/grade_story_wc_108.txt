<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs purpose) act simultaneously during decryption; final choice to face Marcus with vulnerable tokens earns theme through prior causality. No diagnostic labels—embodied terror ("hands shook") layers with frantic focus. Minor abstraction in "trembling certainty" slightly dilutes peak interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost: trembling hands/steady voice reconfigures vulnerability as power. Causal lens holds perfectly—shell discovery → decryption → confrontation. Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in "His hands still trembled, but his voice was steady."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: shell/cast constrain decryption choices and charge final image (held as weapons). Sensory details reflect urgency—rotting books ignored while counting wavy lines. Library’s peeled roof mirrors Leo’s exposed identity, avoiding overt symbolism. One generic descriptor ("cold, indifferent sky") barely limits 9.5+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Leo’s agency: decoding narrows options to confrontation. Dominant stake (proving vulnerability=power) tightens when Marcus arrives—no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is visceral (physical tremors) and conceptual (identity loss). Near-miss: secondary phobia stakes slightly underexploited during decryption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (holding vulnerable tokens as strength) reweights premise without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete actions: fragmented numbers → birthday → identity. Avoids thematic echo by dramatizing "vulnerability is power" through stance, not declaration. Resonant ambiguity in "weapon of entertainment" lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: stuntman’s physical awareness ("hands usually steady") filters all detail. Rhythm modulates under stress—shorter sentences during panic, flowing cadence in decryption. Voice contamination in "familiar, deep-seated terror" (slightly clinical) prevents 9.3+. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during memory recall.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractured, dream-like memories" compresses backstory). Minor register drift in "transformative betrayal" (elevated diction) disrupts POV lexicon. Final line avoids thematic echo by anchoring concept in action ("vulnerability was the power itself"). Near-flawless propulsion, but one borderline abstraction limits 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms amnesia trope via stunt double specificity: phobias exploited for "controlled fears," decryption through child’s drawings. Emotional truth in choosing verbal confrontation over physical stunt. Fresh synthesis—vulnerability as active weapon—feels inevitable from prior details. Avoids safety middle with bold, un-gimmicked structural risk.</comment>
