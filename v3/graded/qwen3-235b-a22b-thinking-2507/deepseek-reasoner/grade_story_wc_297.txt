<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear compulsion-driven motivation ("burning need," "not a choice but a compulsion") and embodied emotion ("bark-like whorls," "tearing away from earth") anchor choices, but internal contradiction remains underdeveloped; closure choice feels earned through prior linking actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (imploded understanding, "anxious elation settled into quiet joy") with conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors firmly by line 5 ("cobalt glade," "eclipsed covenant present reality"), though late lens clarity risks minor deduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade functions as micro-setting: the blue light's "solid" quality and luminescent moss directly constrain movement ("rooted feet dragging... small agony"), charging the final image where light "weaves through scars" to form "stable network."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency (linking scars) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to one path; cost ("small agony" of tearing from earth, "violent shock" of connections) is felt but lacks tangible trade-off beyond emotional toll, limiting high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "scars as connectors" motif: final image reweights "binding" as "threads in grand tapestry," avoiding moralizing; "eclipsed covenant" shifts from broken promise to "dormant one," offering non-literal answer to "how pain becomes connection."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air hummed deep resonant blue," "liquid sapphire one could drown in") modulates with pressure; tense/stage stable despite lyrical compression, though "purposefully curious" trait risks label-speak without deeper contradiction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops, but "dizzying cocktail of dread...terrifying hope" exemplifies overwriting in high-pressure beat; strong verbs ("sheared," "latching," "imploded") offset slight thematic echo in "foundation" final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "root-bound" as anchor (not curse) transforms chosen-fate trope; cobalt glade's permanent dusk gains "new quality" through specific, earned reconfiguration rather than generic hope.</comment>
