<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("thrill" vs "alarm") drives choices; "orthogonal approaches" shown through concrete research avenues. Final burial choice earns endurance via prior causality, but "less fragile time" softens cost slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seed arrival → research → vault design → confrontation. Earned Stasis closure lands with conceptual cost ("less fragile time") when seed is buried. Orientation flawless within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting: shifts from "whispered puzzles" to urgent rhythm, then becomes seed's burial site. Charges final image ("innovation could flow again") while constraining Elara's hiding choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard innovation) tightens via research→vault→confrontation sequence. Cost is conceptual (world's fragility) but lacks tangible forfeiture; pursuers' threat remains slightly abstract despite agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "flow" motif: brook's rhythm mirrors innovation pressure. Final burial reweights "safeguard" from active defense to patient endurance without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "wrinkled bulb, a corpse flower seed" filtered through puzzle-designer lens. Voice modulates from clinical ("hyper-resonant") to poetic ("storm-born silence") under pressure, no POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "brook" recurrence deepens meaning without redundancy. Slight register drift in "hyper-resonant" during research beat costs 0.2, but rhythm accelerates perfectly during vault confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms botanical thriller via escape room framing: "orthogonal approaches" mechanic feels organic, not checklist. Corpse flower weaponization premise avoids Wikipedia voice through specific "sonic frequencies" integration.</comment>
