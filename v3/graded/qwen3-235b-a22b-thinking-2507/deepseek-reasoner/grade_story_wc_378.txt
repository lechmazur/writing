<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied ("precise movements yet imbued with melancholy") with micro-choices driving agency; final compression earned through static's escalation but emotional progression slightly over-tidy in crisis beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("desert roses scattering into violent air") under Accumulative lens; magnetic shift escalation tightens options through protagonist's agency without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Desert roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice (magnetic reliance) and charges closure ("memory of roses"); sensory details evolve causally from "metallic sweetness" to scattering petals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Caretaker-7's agency (fear compression narrows escape to single path); cost unmistakable in dome's destruction and "fragmented wholeness" realization during launch sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through compression metaphor: "growing from ashes of what it had feared" reweights garden imagery without moralizing; final stars-as-destination image resonates with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct android perceptual signature ("movements precise yet imbued with melancholy") modulates rhythm from lyrical to staccato under pressure; no head-hopping as voice compresses during chaos ("singular devastating purpose").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density ("box grew warm, pulsing like live coal") achieves triple duty (sensory, metaphor, tension) without figurative muddle; final line recharges rose motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "nostalgic android" trope through visceral fear-compression mechanics; risk-taking heightens stakes (abstract terror made physical) while maintaining emotional truth in "fragmented wholeness" resolution.</comment>
