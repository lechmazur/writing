<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief vs curiosity) act in scene; final choice earned by telescope revelation with visible cost ("not to hide from endings"). "Genuinely artificial" repetition slightly undermines specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("illuminate them" reconfigures purpose); Accumulative lens holds via sensory accumulation. No orientation debt; lens taught early through dust/cranes/flower.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring locket constrains choice (etching process) and charges final image ("cool against her chest"). Workshop dust and telescope transform from atmosphere to active constraints on grief perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via telescope revelation (decay→transformation), narrowing Elara's options to "illuminate endings." Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in posture shift from "hiding" to "blooming."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through dying flower/cosmic scale reprise; "curtains of intention" reframes grief without moralizing. Final locket embodies transformation, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes dancing," "skin like star-charted parchment") with rhythmic control; compression taught via origami progression. Slight register drift in "genuinely artificial" repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "wilting petals were not a funeral shroud" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor scaffold in "genuinely artificial" repetitions (x2) but no closure impact; final line crystallizes charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes mourning jewelry with cosmic renewal through specific "dying flower" lens; transforms grief tropes via telescope's perceptual shift. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry ("curtains of intention" as active constraint).</comment>
