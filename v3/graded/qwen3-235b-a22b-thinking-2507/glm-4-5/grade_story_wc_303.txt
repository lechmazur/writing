<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (preserve history vs Empire's dominance) through concrete actions like the ritual, but telepathic plant connection lacks prior complication of choices; the desert rose's anxiety feels plot-convenient rather than earned from established struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Empire gets hollow trophy while true essence blooms, with visible cost in the violin's "inert" state and "deep scars"; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens toward the final image without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice violin's "microscopic fractures" function as micro-setting that constrains choice (propagation via harmonic resonance) and charges the final image (crystal dust becoming new growth); environment actively shapes tactics through the observatory's light-absorbing drapes and greenhouse specimens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: coffee prophecy forces immediate action, narrowing options to propagation with visible cost (violin's inert state); Empire threat remains slightly abstract but gains visceral weight through the iron eagle crest prophecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of ice-violin bloom offers non-literal answer to "preserving dreams against empire" without moralizing; theme emerges from concrete propagation act, though "singular dream" phrasing edges toward abstraction that slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "ache that settled in her bones, a fruit left too long on the branch"; rhythmic control under pressure evident in compressed syntax during ritual, but minor scaffold in "perforated destiny" repetition slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion maintained through varied sentence rhythms ("She laid down her calipers and prepared the ritual" vs lyrical descriptions); minor redundancy in "cold vacancy, a silence" costs 0.2 but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice physics and botanical propagation feels inevitable in hindsight; avoids derivative tropes through specific harmonic mechanics, though proximity to Borges' object-obsession stories slightly tempers originality.</comment>
