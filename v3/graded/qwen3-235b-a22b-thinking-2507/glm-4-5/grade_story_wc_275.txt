<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between hunter legacy and nurturing path is clear but lacks active friction in-scene; embodied emotion strong yet micro-choices under pressure feel minimal as stakes remain abstract without tangible opposition testing her resilience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: her finishing work crystallizes endurance with felt cost ("continuation of goodness in a world determined to unravel"), but the "tower fall" backdrop lacks active pressure tightening tactics within the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass dome functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—condensation mirroring meditation breaths, desert heat transformed by her tranquility—constraining her choices while embodying the "tranquil blaze" theme; sensory details are purpose-driven and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weaving continuity through chaos) is signaled early but escalation remains internal; wrapping the cutting with airship scrap deepens commitment without narrowing options or altering tactics, missing the visible price required for high-band escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through desert roses as vessels of virtue—final image of "thread of meaning woven through chaos" reweights prior material without moralizing—but lacks the non-literal answer demanded by the 9+ quick test, settling near the top of strong-with-minor-slips band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("senselessly perceptive," noticing "withered petal, every drooping stem") and rhythmic control elevate voice; minor filter-verb use ("she sensed," "she knew") prevents 9.0+ despite purposeful compression taught early through the dome's breathing metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion ("fragile stem in airship scrap fabric"), but "fragrant whispers" and "imperceptible vibrations" verge on overwriting in peak beats; no loops or scaffold, yet slight figurative muddle dulls closure’s tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "bounty hunter’s pacifist daughter" trope through desert roses as virtue vessels; "tranquil blaze" synthesis feels inevitable, but safety-hedging in conflict resolution (no tangible cost to her methods) prevents the risk-taking required for 9.0+.</comment>
