<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (waning strength vs deepening connection) manifest physically in marble rituals; final endurance choice earns Earned Stasis through decades of mended marbles as embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: scientists' visit deepens pressure without causal escalation, crystallizing Charged Poise closure where "strength waning" legibly charges the final image of marbles as silent witnesses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marbles function as micro-setting that constrains choice (cerus petal marble placement) and charges closure as "silent witnesses to mended deception," transforming generic garden into tactile, lived-in crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden's sentience vs scientific quantification) tightens through cereus victory and scientists' impending visit; aging body provides felt cost that alters Elias's tactics (teaching apprentice).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image "wild yet ordered, scientific yet magical" reweights theme through marbles' mended deception without moralizing; epiphany earned via cereus flowering and apprentice teaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in light/crack observations ("petals resembling intricate cracks"), though "mended deception" concept explanation slightly drifts into expository interiority during high-pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Garden was blooming withering" syntax awkwardness and two minor paraphrase loops ("transformation... turning flaws," "concealed... deception") slightly dull closure's cadence without breaking momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marbles' mended deception synthesizes magical realism with philosophical depth; "blooming withering" paradox feels inevitable through specific garden mechanics rather than abstract novelty.</comment>
