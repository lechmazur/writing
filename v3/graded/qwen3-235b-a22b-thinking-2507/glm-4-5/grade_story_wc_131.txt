<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("kindly methodical" vs. hidden existence) and embodied sense memory drive micro-choices under pressure; flaw: "needed you" pronoun slip disrupts POV consistency at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (risk of exposure), but tape discovery relies on coincidence rather than causal agency; orientation solid by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crawl space setting actively constrains movement ("wedged between copper pipe"), with "sapphire hush" evolving to charge final image; environment shapes every tactical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving electrical crisis) tightens via tape discovery, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; cost (potential exposure) is felt yet abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge emerges through tape fragment's journey; final image reweights "sapphire hush" as active concealment without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers trailing cool pipes") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "ferromagnetic" terminology slightly jars in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle but "kindly methodical" repetition (3x) creates subtle synonym churn; no closure-dulling artifacts yet density slightly flags in reflection block.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of library infrastructure/history feels inevitable; risk-taking (single POV in crawl space) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
