<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; motivation remains abstract ("voice of unknown") with no visible struggle or earned change. Final choice lacks tangible cost—fossil acceptance feels preordained, not earned through prior causality. Micro-choices limited to passive observation without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "renewed purpose" and fossil warmth show positive reinforcement, not legible sacrifice. Orientation succeeds early, but Accumulative lens pressure never tightens—discovery feels inevitable, not earned through narrowing options. Non-closure accumulation cap applied for 3+ flaws.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Caves described vividly but function as passive backdrop; no environmental constraint alters Maya's safe descent or choices. Thermal equipment acts as micro-setting but doesn't charge the final image—fossil's warmth symbolizes purpose, not cost. Misses Q3 9+ gate requiring setting to constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("voice of unknown") remain abstract with zero escalation—Maya faces no resistance (ropes hold, no physical threat). Dominant stake isn't tested; fossil "chooses her" without trade-offs. Agency is passive reception, not decision/renunciation with visible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph: "she would be the one to tell them" states the thesis outright. Theme lacks complexity—fossil's purpose is explicitly confirmed with no ambiguity. Fails organic emergence; insights arise from exposition, not earned struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature; clinical descriptions ("thermal signatures") feel generic, not character-particular. Under stress, diction doesn't degrade—"sat for hours learning" contradicts peak-pressure expectations. Rhythmic control weakens in closure with repetitive "purpose" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Maya descended... Maya approached...") dulls immediacy. Overwriting in closure: "renewed purpose... constant reminder... fulfill her motivation" violates concision. Filter-verb stack ("watching... understanding... realizing") obscures cause/effect near closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "chosen one" fossil trope lacks fresh synthesis. Sensory map maker role mirrors common sci-fi archetypes without specific lived detail. Emotional truth undermined by passive protagonist—no bold risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
