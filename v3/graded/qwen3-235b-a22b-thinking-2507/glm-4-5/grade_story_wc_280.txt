<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refused to take final curtain call" versus dissolution, but "despair" abstraction slightly weakens embodied emotion during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (flickering form, fading coin), though timeline mechanics lack causal precision in mid-beat escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mystic orchard's synesthetic details (petals tasting like laughter, cinnamon-scented caretaker) constrain choices and charge the final dissolution image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through song escalation, but "fractured timeline" remains abstract despite visible cost; pressure lacks concrete mid-scene tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects (tarot coin's transformation), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "encore" as sacrifice without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("thunder tasted," "scent of starlight") creates rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping despite temporal shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "another echo, another memory, another possibility" dulls climax rhythm; otherwise flawless density with strategic telling compressing backstory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost-concept transformed through synesthetic singing mechanics; "refused curtain call" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh without derivative tropes.</comment>
