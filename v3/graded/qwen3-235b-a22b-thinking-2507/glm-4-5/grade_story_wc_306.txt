<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fisherman’s transformation feels unearned; resistance to acceptance occurs off-page in summarized dialogue rather than dramatized micro-choices. Elian’s interior contradiction ("protected vulnerability" vs. professional detachment) is concrete and embodied through the mirror shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Charged Poise (mirror revealing "endless possibilities"), but the fisherman’s pivotal shift occurs in telling summary ("listened, his expression shifting..."), violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for pressure accumulation through dramatized beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind chimes function as micro-setting that constrains choice (sea glass/driftwood chime selection directly shapes advice) and charges the final image. "Breezy lighthouse" lacks specific pressure beyond atmosphere, slightly diluting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via chime selection sequence under Accumulative lens, but the fisherman’s moral resolution lacks visible cost—his "reluctant acceptance" is narrated, not shown through earned behavioral change that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror’s evolution from "protected vulnerability" to "possibilities," avoiding moralizing. Final line risks slight thematic echo but is redeemed by prior concrete work with wind chime philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hollow mirror shard," wind chime frequencies) and rhythmic control under pressure. "Sincerely insincere" diction stays within Elian’s plausible lexicon without diagnostic overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop on "hollow mirror shard" (4 near-identical mentions) in the final third dulls closure image, capping high-band eligibility. Otherwise strong specificity ("sea glass and driftwood," "brass for truth").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "conscience for hire" trope through wind chime mechanics and mirror shard specificity. Emotional truth in Elian’s professional detachment vs. longing avoids safety middle, with fresh inflection in "doubt as truth’s companion."</comment>
