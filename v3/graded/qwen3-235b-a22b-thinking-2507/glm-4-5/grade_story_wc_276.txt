<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic label "gift to transliterates emotions" in peak beat undermines embodied conflict; no contradictory impulses shown during climax despite high stakes, rendering motivation static and closure unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (altered constellations), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—constellations' unease never concretely opposes the fisher's actions under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sound wave garden vividly realized, and rail spike charges the final image ("hummed with captured echo"), but setting never constrains choices—the fisher navigates instability effortlessly without tactical adaptation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catching echo) signaled early, but pressure never escalates: constellations' disturbance remains observational, no narrowing of options, and the conceptual cost lacks felt urgency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of "touching beyond oneself" emerges through particulars, but final paragraph's explicit statement ("He hadn't sought power or glory, only understanding") triggers thematic echo penalty, capped due to Q4's weak escalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thoughts formed dancing, transparent flora") and rhythmic control shine; minor corporate diction ("transliterates") in peak beat avoided major deduction under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops in final beat ("The echo would change him too... Years later") dull closure; template cadence in zigzag descriptions triggers -0.4 artifact penalty without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh "voicing silence" concept elevates familiar mythic quest, but rail spike's transformation lacks middle development; derivative premise guardrail (-0.3) applies as emotional arc fits generic template.</comment>
