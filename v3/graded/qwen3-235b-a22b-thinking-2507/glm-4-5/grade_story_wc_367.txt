<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("joy weighted by responsibility") is concrete but "shadowed elation" becomes repetitive label rather than deepening embodiment; accidental prophecy worry lacks contradictory impulses in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise with "shadowed elation" cost) lands cleanly, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the twin comets occur coincidentally, not through her choices, weakening causal pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse actively constrains choices (climbing stairs, beam modification); lantern wick's luminescence charges the final image. Minor flaw: "unpredictable室白鲟" typo disrupts sensory coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (prophecy accuracy) are clear but pressure doesn't deepen meaningfully—worry remains internal without testing through action; cost ("responsibility") is felt but not dramatized via trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery emerges through concrete actions (manuscripts, beam paths), not abstraction. Final image reweights "ancient shadows" without moralizing, though "shadowed elation" risks thematic echo in closing beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/water focus) and rhythmic control shine, but "unpredictable室白鲟" breaks immersion; lyrical compression works yet borders on overwriting during storm approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("aurora energy," "luminescent properties") but "shadowed elation" loops 4x with diminishing returns; minor scaffold in reflection blocks slightly dulls closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "laughing storm herald" and ancient/modern tech feels inevitable, though post-collapse setting leans familiar. Risk-taking (prophecy via laughter) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
