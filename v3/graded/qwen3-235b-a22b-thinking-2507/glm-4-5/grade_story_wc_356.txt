<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in ambition-to-teacher shift lacks causal buildup; epiphany feels unearned despite strong embodied "serenity within motion" moments. No visible cost in transformation weakens closure causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lacks legible cost—"peace she had always sought" asserts resolution without dramatized sacrifice. Missing on-page cost proof violates Q2 gate, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting of wrapping paper interiors constrains choice (doodling as language) and charges final image. "Wildflower hush" motif evolves meaningfully but risks static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite sensory escalation; moonlit revelation relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency. Violates "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</comment><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("keeper of knowledge") triggers -0.6 penalty; wisdom emerges through particulars but "peace" conclusion tells rather than resonates with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("olfactorily sensitive" lens) creates rhythmic control, though "serenity within motion" mantra risks thematic redundancy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops with high information density; minor overwriting ("whispers on the wind") doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion falters only in summary beats like "Days blurred".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corpse flower twist transforms trope through specific sensory logic, but "olfactorily sensitive" trait feels derivative. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation earns distinction bonus.</comment>
