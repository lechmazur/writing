<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (preserving memory through cosmic verse) is clear and consistent, but interiority remains abstract; "obsidian grace" lacks embodied contradiction in pivotal moments like the anchoring, reducing emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Lira’s transformation forecloses mobility with visible cost (rooted stillness), but the nostalgia ban’s pressure lacks concrete on-page escalation beyond atmospheric dread, weakening causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight garden functions as micro-setting that charges closure (sanctuary enabling cosmic inscription), yet sensory specificity narrows to visual dominance during transformation, missing urgency-driven tactile or olfactory shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (memory vs. erasure) tighten through Lira’s agency observing gaps, with felt cost in sacrificed mobility; the ban’s threat remains abstract but gains weight via her skin becoming "manuscript," crystallizing the trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—inscribing symbols from observed gaps—avoiding moralizing; the final image ("living testament to memory’s power") reweights nostalgia as rebellion without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("obsidian grace," noticing gaps) sustains voice, but elevated diction ("manuscript of cosmic wisdom") clashes with tide dancer’s implied lexicon during peak transformation, slightly disrupting POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose shines in rhythmic control ("threads of luminous ink, weaving across her arms"), yet scaffold appears in the fledge attempt reflection ("For months... possibility itself"), diluting momentum before the moonstone discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tide dancing with cosmic inscription avoids nostalgia tropes, but "elective exile" feels archetypal; specificity in "gaps between stars" elevates the premise beyond generic rebellion.</comment>
