<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (feisty persistence vs. grief) drive choices, but mender backstory lacks causal integration; quartz eye's embodied ache elevates interiority yet "endearingly feisty" labels weaken specificity during bridge-building.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: seed exchange crystallizes reconfiguration with tears as visible cost; Accumulative lens holds through density buildup, though footprints discovery slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices (ceiling apples dictate bridge design) and charges final image; moss/rafters supply tactile resources, but "impossibly growing" apples risk verisimilitude without deeper causal integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulated symbolic weight (ribbon→seed), but escalation lacks visible pressure spikes; footprints discovery narrows options effectively though protagonist agency feels passive in key turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "roots remain" reconfiguration of deciduous vows without moralizing; final watering with dual tears charges the seed with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss with "accidental wisdom" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz eye aching," "deciduous vows flittered") modulates beautifully under stress; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure, though "endearingly feisty" intrudes as authorial label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats with exquisite propulsion, but "feisty nature showing" scaffold and repetitive "endearingly feisty" labels trigger minor momentum drag in non-critical sections.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mender lore with deciduous metaphors feels inevitable; orchard-cathedral fusion transforms tropes, though "quartz eye" risks quirkiness without deeper functional integration beyond symbolism.</comment>
