<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear through ritual choices, but sudden skepticism-to-wonder shift lacks sufficient buildup; "finally and fully yielding" feels unearned without prior micro-choices showing erosion of doubt during high-pressure bone-setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with dissolving maze walls and boundary softening, but conceptual cost ("renewal through mystery") remains abstract; no concrete image shows the price of lost certainty beyond thematic assertion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden constrains choices: moonpetals enable the ritual circle while upside-down blooms mirror worldview inversion; dissolving walls directly alter outcome, making setting indispensable to closure's physical reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through bone-setting ritual's sensory escalation (tooth vibration → reality blur), but conceptual cost feels under-dramatized; "renewal" softens the price of shattered certainty needed for high-band escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mistakes into constellations" evolving from Eleanor's theory to Arthur's whispered phrase; final image of dissolving boundaries reweights forgiveness without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific terms ("iridescent luminescence") with visceral metaphors ("humming awakened childhood memories"); psychic distance shifts intentionally during ritual without convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor abstraction in "renewal through mystery" slightly dulls closure impact; otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops—final constellation image achieves high density through concrete action ("hands joined," "boundary softened").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms changeling tropes via bone-setting mechanics and Victorian botanical engineering; avoids derivative safety by making forgiveness active ("aligning realities") though "constellations" metaphor edges near familiar templates.</comment>
