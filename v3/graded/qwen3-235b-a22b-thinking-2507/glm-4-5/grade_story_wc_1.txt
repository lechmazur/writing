<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (trembling hands vs precise artist), embodied emotion via tea grip and frost study, but "realization struck with physical blow" edges toward diagnostic label-speak under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost (worldview shattered, life at risk); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through frost pattern accumulation, though ledger discovery occurs off-page pre-story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Canyon micro-setting constrains choice (frost patterns as decoding method) and charges final image; "drifting resonance" motif evolves from sensory detail to emotional anchor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Lena's agency decoding patterns, narrowing options to confrontation; cost legible in "fate of others" line, but dominant stake (art-mineral conspiracy) signaled late (paragraph 5).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete art-mineral synthesis ("artist must become the art"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "pauses between crisis" without stating thesis, though "luminous effects" phrasing borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline structures that spoke"), rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; minor register drift when "conceptual cost" appears in Lena's thought mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "drifting resonance" verbatim repetition in paragraphs 4 and 8 triggers paraphrase-loop penalty; frost pattern descriptions risk figurative density in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art/science/conspiracy through glass medium; "frost pattern decoding" transforms trope via specific mineral knowledge, though smuggler's ledger feels derivative without deeper world logic.</comment>
