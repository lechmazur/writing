<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong ("anxiety and anticipation warred") with embodied emotion ("settled into her bones like knowledge of gravity"), but Leo's underdevelopment weakens relationship-as-crucible; secret's vagueness limits stakes specificity despite visible cost in revaluing her life's work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "knew she needed to revalue everything" crystallizes the shift with undeniable conceptual cost; accumulative lens held through density increase ("palette of resolve expanded") without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember nexus actively constrains choice (geothermal warmth enabling tool arrangement) and charges final image ("witness the birth of a new art"); micro-setting mastery where nautilus shell's rainbows fracture "potential futures" reweights closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen coherently from preserving light to capturing transformation under accumulative lens, but secret's unspecified nature weakens pressure escalation; cost ("revalue everything") legible yet lacks concrete secondary consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through pocket-suns' evolution from "photons" to "weight between words"; final image reweights "capturing essence" without moralizing, though "scientifically romantic" borders on label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mathematics of nature in spirals") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor overwriting ("twilight deepening and brightening simultaneously") slightly dilutes tension in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("ember fragments rising like fireflies"), but "anxiety and anticipation warred" is label-only emotion; final line's conceptual precision ("weight between words") compensates for mid-scene abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Density of presence" concept transforms alchemy tropes through specific physics/poetry synthesis; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, though secret's vagueness slightly diminishes emotional specificity.</comment>
