<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (obsession vs duty) shown through micro-choices like reed whistle handling, but transformation from dread to purpose lacks layered irrationality during climax; embodied emotion strong except final shift feels slightly clean.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("dread transformed into purpose") under consistent Causal lens; orientation clear by line 3; one tightening (whistle crack) sufficient for length with unambiguous cost proof in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Turtle shell setting charges closure (Kael reading patterns as turtle turns), but fails 9+ gate—environment doesn't constrain choices (chamber discovery could occur anywhere); "sunwashed dread" motif elegantly ties atmosphere to emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency (playing whistle), but escalation lacks intermediate friction—single reversal risks neatness; cost ("dread transformed") legible yet slightly abstract for high-band; dominant stake crystalizes early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pattern-language motif reweighted at closure ("keeper of the patterns"), avoiding moralizing; final image answers central question non-literally though secondary "ancient evil" element slightly overpowers thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spiral grooves... ancient patterns") with rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping; elision (expedition details) taught early via journal discovery; voice modulates from clinical cartographer to awed guardian.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("crack appeared... spiderwebbing outward"); "sunwashed dread" avoids cliché through recurrence with evolving weight; minor overwriting risk in "whispered to him day and night" offsets by payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Trope (city on turtle) transformed via pattern-language specificity; "sunwashed dread" reframes familiar dread motif; risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural pressure pays off though gate rust premise edges derivative without deeper world logic exploration.</comment>
