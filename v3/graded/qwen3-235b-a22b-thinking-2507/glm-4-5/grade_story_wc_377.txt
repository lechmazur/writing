<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; muteness treated as pure gift not struggle, missing internal conflict. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond poetic description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (death/immortalized wonder), but lens ambiguity in early muteness section weakens causality. Final spectrum pulse reweights stakes cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Whispering bluff setting creates atmosphere but fails to constrain choices; "above the clouds" remains decorative. Micro-setting (iceberg fragment) charges closure image yet lacks mid-scene pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>No protagonist-driven escalation; iceberg discovery is coincidental, not earned. "Preserving wonder" stake declared but never tested—no tradeoffs or narrowing options despite seasonal muteness potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" explicitly stated as theme ("more complex than any language") triggers thematic echo penalty. Final image resonates but lacks layered ambiguity; wonder presented as uncomplicated good.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV shifts from close third to omniscient ("communities below" observing colors) without justification. Perceptual signature strong in tuning scenes but diluted during legacy passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose lush but "crystal clear and seemingly infinite in its overtones" followed by "unmatched precision" creates paraphrase loop. Minor register drift ("symphonies of truth" feels academic in lyrical context).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light/sound communication elevated by specific mechanics, but "celestial gift" trope undercuts risk. Emotional truth in muteness-as-gift original, yet avoids deeper exploration of communication limits.</comment>
