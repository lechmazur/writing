<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation remains singularly focused on discovery without internal conflict complicating choices. "Cautious exuberance" is stated but not dramatized through competing values during pivotal moments like the library entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: stepping into ordinary world with transformed understanding carries conceptual cost. However, the "second fateful letter" closure threat remains abstract, weakening the Accumulative lens's causal payoff despite strong pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist-library actively constrains choices (ephemeral appearance window) and charges the final image. The watch's cracked crystal functions as micro-setting, reframing reality during documentation—a concrete constraint that shapes the protagonist's tactics under deadline pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via watch's accelerating cycles, but protagonist agency feels passive—discoveries happen *to* them rather than through meaningful trade-offs. The dominant "race against vanishing library" stake lacks visceral cost beyond urgency, diluting the Accumulative pressure's payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through library's unspoken words, avoiding moralizing. Final line ("another unspoken truth...") delivers conceptual repricing, though the explicit "cipher taught that some words gain power only in absence of speaking" slightly over-articulates the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("mist clung to oaks like spectral garments"), with syntax tightening during high-pressure beats. Minor register drift in "cyclically reversed patterns" slightly disrupts voice, but rhythmic control under deadline pressure remains exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "revelations in margins, mirrors, tea leaves" risks checklist rhythm but avoids synonym churn. Final line’s precision ("another unspoken truth in a world full of them") achieves high density without muddle, though "cautious exuberance" leans tell-not-show early on.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "magical library" trope through unspoken-words specificity and watch mechanics. Emotional truth in documenting "sentences turned to vapor" avoids generic wonder, though the confidence man's disappearance lacks integration beyond plot device.</comment>
