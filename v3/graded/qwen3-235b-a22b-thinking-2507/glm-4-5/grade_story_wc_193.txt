<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (survivor's skepticism vs curiosity), but climax choice lacks visible cost—tears of joy don't convey sacrifice. "Virtuously mischievous" trait shown via rule-flouting, yet redemption arc feels unearned without struggle in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure is Decisive Change (diamonds form), but cost proof test fails—no on-page sentence showing price paid. Causal lens holds (text clues → bolt activation), yet effortless transformation undercuts stakes; pressure-to-diamonds requires visible sacrifice to qualify for high band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms create vivid sensory hierarchy (spores "sparkling in light"), but setting doesn't constrain choices—it's atmospheric backdrop, not micro-setting shaping tactics. Final diamond display charged by glow, yet lacks causal pressure on Maya's actions to hit 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (bolt = redemption), escalation via glitchy texts → terrace discovery tightens options. But agency passive—Maya follows instructions rather than making hard choices; diamonds form without tangible cost (e.g., sacrificed time/safety), violating band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-to-beauty coheres through Maya's backstory and diamond metaphor, but final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("proving something beautiful could come"), triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Should trust imagery over assertion to avoid sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (notices efficiency hacks, rule-flouting opportunities), rhythmic control strong in descent scene. Minor register drift in "shadowseam wonder" jargon, but POV stability and stress-appropriate compression (glitchy texts) elevate tension without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Final beat "pyramid scheme survivor became guardian of a miracle" is blatant thematic echo—stock phrasing dulls closure. "Shadowseam wonder" appears twice as unearned label; artifacts in closure beat trigger -0.9 penalty, disallowing 9+ globally per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bioluminescent farms + quantum promises avoids sci-fi clichés through emotional specificity. "Virtuously mischievous" trait grounds the extraordinary in human behavior, though pressure-to-diamonds metaphor slightly familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
