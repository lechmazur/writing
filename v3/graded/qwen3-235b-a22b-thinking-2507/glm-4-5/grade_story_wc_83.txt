<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows grief/purpose contradiction through embodied "bleak exhilaration," but final transformation lacks sufficient struggle; foreign smile hints at cost but emotional progression feels resolved too neatly without deeper contradiction in the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: cooling circuit breakers create narrow window driving descent/harvest. Closure is decisive Charged Poise—Elias seeing "infinite possibility" with visible cost (rare smile feeling foreign), reconfiguring stakes through earned causality without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Collapsing amphitheater functions as micro-setting that directly constrains the harvest action and charges the final image ("infinite possibility"). Mutated garden and ozone scent are selective, purpose-driven details reflecting urgency, though tactile interaction during resonance could deepen constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvest potential before systems reboot) tightens relentlessly via causal chain: cooling breakers → descent → pool convergence. Final cost is conceptual—Elias embracing his transformed identity with "bleak exhilaration"—made undeniable by the foreignness of his smile as systems hum back to life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of loss-to-potential emerges solely through concrete action (harvesting dreams from amphitheater ruins), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "devastation" into "infinite possibility" with visceral cost—the rare smile’s foreignness proving earned resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors that shouldn’t exist," "intangibly tangible") reflects scientific grief. Rhythm accelerates during descent ("He landed softly... followed the crystal’s pull"), but minor scaffold in backstory paragraph slightly dulls immediacy without breaking voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with "bleak exhilaration" doing triple duty, but "intangibly tangible" label repeats three times with diminishing impact. Minor paraphrase loop in observatory description ("sanctuary and prison... orbiting wasteland") costs 0.3 without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "unused potential pools" transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific emotional calculus (grief fueling purpose). Amphitheater as reservoir of lost dreams avoids symbolic convenience, with risks like "colors that shouldn’t exist" heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
