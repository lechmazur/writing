<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans abstract; "defy gravity of hopelessness" lacks embodied contradiction despite strong micro-choices like tracing mosaic tiles. Final endurance feels earned but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "night no longer felt starless" reconfigures meaning with felt cost in "final ember faded" silence. Missing visceral price—cost is implied but not concretely legible per Q2 cost-proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blooming fortress actively constrains and charges closure: acoustics enable the display, moonflowers "lean toward light," and final transformation into "beacon of renewal" reweights prior despair. Environment shapes every choice yet slightly over-ornamented in courtyard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural density (colors "that sang," "whispered," "danced") under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to the final ignition. Cost remains conceptual—no tangible forfeiture—preventing 8.8+ despite coherent pressure toward the "defiance" climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory accumulation: "purple that sang" reweights hope without moralizing. Final image of "beacon of renewal" offers resonant answer to despair, but "gravity of hopelessness" phrasing borders on abstraction, slightly diluting earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers," "ambient awareness") and rhythmic control shine in ignition sequence. Minor register drift in "defy gravity of hopelessness" but compression of sensory detail under pressure remains masterful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "impossible blue that illuminated his determined features" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in "petals drinking in the spectacle" but no closure-dulling artifacts—lyricism consistently serves momentum and closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks-as-hope through mosaic mechanics avoids sentimentality. "Serious playfulness" transforms trope via concrete craft details, but premise remains adjacent to familiar renewal narratives without sufficiently bold risk-taking for 9.0+.</comment>
