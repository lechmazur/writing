<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when guilt ("dissonance nested in his chest") wars with hope during firmware calibration; embodied emotion peaks as tears stream while feeling vibrations through floorboards—no labels, pure sensory cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when amber shifts from "prison" to "sanctuary," but temporal folding lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens; cost legible via tears/vibrations yet escalation feels passive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber constrains every choice: from setup (mentor’s gift) to climax (tethering medium), its physical warmth and insect movement charge the final image—micro-setting as essential pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through firmware’s behavior (baby cries → lullaby), but Elias acts reactively; pressure tightens via time-folding’s "origami" compression, yet protagonist agency lacks decisive escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through amber’s transformation: guilt’s "dissonance" reweights to "stillness" via musical notes tattoo—no moralizing, only resonant image reconfiguring grief without resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: deafness filters sound into vibrations, firmware "whirrs" as constellations; rhythmic control under stress via fragmented sentences ("The meteor hush fell...") avoids dialogue pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "raking at the dissonance of old guilt that nested in his chest" dilutes momentum; otherwise crystalline prose where "insect seemed to pulse with life" avoids purple prose while advancing dual tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Deaf constellation tattooist premise transforms grief tropes via firmware-as-ink metaphor; risk-taking in sound-as-vibration logic feels inevitable, though "meteor hush" borders on familiar.</comment>
