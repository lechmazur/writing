<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown (blessing/curse of gift) but "emotionally contagious" and "stored remorse" verge on diagnostic label-speak during peak subsumption, triggering anti-pattern deduction. Final endurance earned though emotional layering lacks sufficient irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with legible cost ("hands trembling but heart lighter") under Accumulative lens. Tidal pool method's middle development feels underutilized for pressure escalation, slightly weakening causal density at the critical descent beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corral icebound pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (smoothing method) and charges final image. "Brittle/sturdy" duality anchors sensory hierarchy though desert fortress descriptions occasionally drift toward postcard genericism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (transforming remorse) tightens through Kael's descent with visible emotional cost. Agency manifests via sandpapering method under Accumulative pressure; the "trembling hands" tradeoff perfectly scales cost for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (memory-smoothing) without moralizing. Final image reweights "remorse crystallized" into strengthened resolve, avoiding tidy resolution while answering the central question through charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in chef-centric sensory filtering ("bitter taste on tongue"). Rhythmic control modulates beautifully under pressure though "unspoken dream" repetitions slightly blur temporal clarity in mid-section.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No closure-touching artifacts but "brittle/sturdy" motif risks overuse in high-pressure beats (e.g., "brittle nature of their emotions... brittle surfaces"). Minor density issues in pavilion descent paragraph dilute propulsion without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary memory-tasting with remorse crystallization feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, though desert trope proximity slightly limits novelty points.</comment>
