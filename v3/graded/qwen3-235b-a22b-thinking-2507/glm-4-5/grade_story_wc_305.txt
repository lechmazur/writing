<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete details (moonstones warming skin) avoids stock phrasing, but "kindly decisive" remains labeled rather than demonstrated through tradeoffs in the climax beat where stakes peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (sacrificing external search for contentment), but cost proof weakens at "become the source herself" where felt consequence remains abstract despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (hairpin) charges the final image when held to starlight, yet fails to constrain choices—the grotto’s cloud-floor and scallop walls remain atmospheric rather than tactical constraints during her pivotal realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (seeking contentment) tighten through ascent, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; the grotto’s "breathing" feels coincidental rather than earned pressure, diluting the cost of her conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through scallop patterns and hairpin etchings, avoiding moralizing—yet "contentment not in one place but embracing all parts" borders on thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, slightly undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," scallop-shell light) shines, but syntax doesn’t modulate under climax pressure; "kindly decisive" reads as narrator imposition rather than character-particular voice during her transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No fatal artifacts, yet subtle loops dilute momentum: "scallop" recurs 5× with diminishing returns, and "contentment" shifts meaning without sufficient groundwork in the final beats where cost must land.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Specific inflections (hairpin from fallen stars, vineyard hush as silence) transform rebirth tropes, but the core premise remains proximate to familiar mystical caretaker archetypes without bold structural risk.</comment>
