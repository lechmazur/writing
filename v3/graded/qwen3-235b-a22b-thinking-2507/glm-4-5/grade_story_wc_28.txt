<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; motivation remains abstract until ritual despite "cradle empathy in arms of steel" setup. Strength: embodied micro-choices (kneeling, tracing) under pressure during naming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density intensifies through memory floods to Charged Poise closure. Weakness: "retrocognitively trapped" concept remains undramatized label without causal consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: mosaic stepping stone actively constrains choice (tile placement site) and charges final image (brighter tessera). Plaza’s ash/wind directly shapes tactics (kneeling, tracing).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes clear (reclaiming identity) but no escalation under Accumulative lens—pressure static after tile discovery. Cost felt in "warmth beneath palm" yet lacks earned deepening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual action: "aberrant mercy" crystallizes in naming’s conceptual repricing. Final image ("mosaic seemed brighter") resonates without moralizing, avoiding all thematic anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (tactile focus on tiles/stones) but "retrocognitively trapped" jargon breaks POV lexicon. Rhythmic control falters in "fragments of civilization" redundancy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "shattered sky" cliché offsets "enameled blue and gold" specificity. Near-loop in "silence and ash, punctuated only by whisper of wind" costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "aberrant mercy" reconfigures post-apocalyptic tropes through naming ritual. Derivative risk in "rise from ashes" line narrowly avoided by concrete mosaic payoff.</comment>
