<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s involuntary truthfulness drives key choices with visible cost (revealing sabotage), but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during the climb; supervisor’s motivation feels earned though "melancholy growing" leans toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: repaired bees working as Elara realizes honesty bridges wonder/truth, with conceptual cost in supervisor’s ruined career; causal escalation holds tightly from tourist inquiry to sabotage reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transformer room’s charred panel physically manifests conflict and charges the final image, but the tower setting rarely constrains choices beyond location; "nectar dusk" elegantly mirrors thematic tension yet lacks mid-scene pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (restoring wonder vs. system stability) escalates cleanly through Elara’s truth compulsion narrowing options; cost is visceral in supervisor’s tears and Elara’s "heart sank," fulfilling the quick test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the supervisor’s "pause the world" speech and Elara’s final smile, avoiding moralizing; the bees’ return offers resonant non-literal answer to "preserve wonder" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gilded conductors," "static dances") modulates with pressure, but minor filter verbs ("she noticed") dilute immediacy during the staircase ascent; dialogue lexicon cleanly distinguishes bureau vs. toll keeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No fatal loops, yet "heart sank" cliché and slight overwriting in "intricate patterns catching golden light" blunt peak-beat urgency; rhythm varies purposefully but final image lacks the textural precision demanded for 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "sabotage" trope through despair motivation and truth compulsion mechanic; "nectar dusk" and drone beehives feel fresh, though the honesty-as-bridge resolution edges toward expectedness despite strong emotional specificity.</comment>
