<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied craft ("fingers danced between gears") and micro-choices under pressure (humming complexity building). Motivation to "reclaim light stolen by midnight" compels credible endurance, but slight abstraction in "magic that lived within it" near closure dilutes otherwise concrete emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: music box's reactivation crystallizes truth/silence stakes with visceral cost ("surge of warmth through fingertips"). Orientation perfect by paragraph 1; single tightening (11pm→midnight strikes) suffices, though covenant's origin ("broken promise") told not dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices—amplifying hum into "tinkersong wonder" and charging final image ("echo of that first reclaimed melody"). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias' craft: sound as "perfume," stone's warmth against chest, oak walls shaping acoustics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' agency: clock strikes narrow options as he hums/tethers, with cost unmistakable in rust recoiling "hissing like steam on iron." Dominant stake (music vs silence) signaled immediately; single deepening (11pm strike) reweights truth's urgency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—"mending what wasn't torn" embodies preserving intangible essence. Final image ("smallest light push back darkest night") offers resonant answer to "can beauty persist?" without moralizing, though "magic that lived within it" slightly tells where showing would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: repairman notices "faintest chime," feels warmth in "bones." Syntax modulates with pressure—lyrical early ("melody woven from dreams"), urgent at climax ("clock tower struck midnight"). Zero head-hopping; rhythm accelerates as stakes tighten.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fingers danced between gears like composer's across piano keys" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only microscopic flaw: "tinkersong wonder" slightly forced compound. Final paragraph’s cadence ("Elias smiled... guardian of light") resolves with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "resonance" repair method transforms trope into emotional truth. Bold risk—climax hinges on sensory overload (stone's blaze, bell-like sound) rather than action. Avoids abstraction via verifiable detail: rust as consequence of dishonesty, not mere decay.</comment>
