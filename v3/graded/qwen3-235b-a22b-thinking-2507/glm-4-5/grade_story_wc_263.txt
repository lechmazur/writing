<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "cacophony she could neither silence nor transform," but micro-choices under pressure lack specificity; no concrete moment showing hands failing to shape clay despite stated blockage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "bittersweet knowledge of all the vision she had missed," but orientation fails: location remains vague past 120 words ("aurora-lit archway" without geographic cues), applying -0.4 penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 per Q2 orientation penalty; atmospheric details (nighthawks, mountain laurels) enrich texture but don't constrain choices or alter tactics during stargazing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation succeeds through sensory density ("nighthawks whispered... stones sang"), but cost remains abstract; no tangible consequence like ruined artwork to ground the creative blockage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "distill infinite voices into manageable beauty" avoids moralizing; final image of stars "mapped in her soul" resonates without stating a moral, fulfilling Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice modulates effectively under pressure ("remembered stardust in her veins began to thrum"), but "moonstruck dreamer" repetition creates subtle tic; rhythmic control prevents 9.0 despite strong perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "her hands could no longer shape clay, her brush could no longer hold pigment" weakens propulsion; no closure-tainting artifacts but prevents 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes "blocked artist" trope with celestial mechanics uniquely; "astronomical instrument's brass embrace" transforms generic stargazing into specific, indispensable method for creative rebirth.</comment>
