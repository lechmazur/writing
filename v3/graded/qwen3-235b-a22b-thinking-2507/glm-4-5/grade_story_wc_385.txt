<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation shift from curiosity to compassion occurs without visible struggle. "Richly perceptive" trait remains label-only without embodied tradeoffs during critical choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: "who/where/when" unclear past 120 words (vague "canyon echo singer" in undefined space). Closure lands as Earned Stasis with cost (melancholy transforming to bittersweet hope), but disorientation caps Q3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Serpentine nexus" remains white-room syndrome; spatial incoherence prevents setting from constraining choices. Recurring objects (seashell, canyon walls) don't actively shape tactics despite vivid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("balance undisturbed") without tangible pressure narrowing options. Child's echo threat lacks concrete escalation; cost is felt but not visibly earned through struggle against meaningful opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through singer's transformed understanding ("not all are ready to let go"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "why some people echo" without stating moral, though "webs of intrigue" feels decorative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("steps as silent as falling dust") with rhythmic control, but "reed-blown melancholy" repetition becomes tic-like. Minor register drift in "cosmic harmony" phrasing under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Template cadence in "She was richly perceptive..." paragraphs; "whispering seashell half" repeats without evolution. Filter-verb stacks ("noticing how", "sensed") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Transforms "guide spirit" trope through specific voice and seashell motif. Emotional truth elevates familiar melancholy tone, but "serpentine nexus" leans on fantasy tropes without fresh grounding.</comment>
