<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("bones," "fingers stained") and shows contradictory impulses (despair vs thread-tangling persistence), but the "red for passion" labeling feels reductive. Final choice earned through concrete action, though cost lacks visceral weight beyond "not flawless, it was alive."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "not flawless, it was alive" crystallizes the artistic trade-off. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—dust motes to threads deepen the fragmentation theme. Minor slip: tarot box's shifting cards border on convenient symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse library constrains choice (circular walls intensify claustrophobia) and charges closure ("walls stilled... transformed into a gentle embrace"). The charcoal-smudged fingers function as micro-setting that directly alters tactics during the redesign climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (perfectionism vs authentic artistry) tighten through thread-untangling, but escalation leans slightly on fate (tarot box discovery). Cost is legible in the portrait's "not flawless" imperfection, though protagonist agency could drive pressure more actively.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "finding meaning in fractured pieces" reweights fragmentation without moralizing. Final image ("luminescent ache... rendered visible") offers resonant answer, though "wasn't that what she'd been trying to capture" flirts with over-explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes dancing like tiny stars") and rhythmic control shine, but "luminescent ache" repetition risks scaffold. Rhetorical questions slightly disrupt flow, yet psychic distance stays tightly controlled within POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density ("charcoal into gray oblivion") with minimal loops, though "reality began to reassemble... reality had not been a problem" creates a paraphrase echo. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "luminescent ache" recurrence near end blocks 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the "artistic block" trope through specific, lived details (thread colors tied to artistic traits). Emotional truth in embracing imperfection feels fresh, with the lighthouse library anchoring universals in tangible setting.</comment>
