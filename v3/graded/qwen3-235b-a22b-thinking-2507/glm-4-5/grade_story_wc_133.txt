<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena's embodied trauma ("hands trembled," "sleepless nights") and pigment obsession show concrete interiority, but her exchange choice lacks contradictory impulses—no visible struggle between keeping the brooch as a talisman versus accepting the woman's offer beyond brief hesitation. The "wryly earnest" trait remains stated rather than tested in a micro-choice with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: Lena's insomnia fading as purpose clarifies ("hands steady as they mixed") reconfigures her stance with conceptual cost (relinquishing the brooch's "ghostly warmth"). However, the old woman's sudden appearance feels coincidental rather than earned by Lena's agency, weakening escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal island functions as micro-setting—rain trails constrain navigation and symbolize trauma processing, while the pigments directly charge the final image as tools for "testimony." "Reading rain trails" evolves causally from survival skill to artistic metaphor, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (insomnia vs. purpose) tighten meaningfully at the exchange, but escalation isn't protagonist-driven; Lena reacts to the woman's offer rather than deepening pressure through her choices. The brooch's loss provides visible cost, yet the resolution relies on external intervention rather than Lena's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Lena's pigment work ("transforming trauma into testimony"), not moralizing. The final line—"exchanges of stories and understanding"—risks thematic echo but stays earned via the brooch/pigment exchange. Avoids tidy binaries by focusing on "what remains" amid loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading rain trails," pigment fixation) reflects Lena's artistic POV. Minor filter-verb stacks ("Lena felt," "she understood") dull immediacy in the exchange scene, but rhythmic control ("colors flowing like water") heightens the dream sequence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean syntax with purposeful variation, but synonym loops weaken momentum: "fragmented memories" (para 1) echoes "fragmented corridors" (para 3). Final paragraph slightly overwrites ("testament to possibilities beyond destruction"), though closure imagery ("hands steady") remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms the "traumatized artist" trope through tidal island constraints and pigment symbolism. Fresh inflection in "thresh meaning from experience" as physical art-making, but "insomniac painter" proximity to cliché prevents higher score despite strong execution.</comment>
