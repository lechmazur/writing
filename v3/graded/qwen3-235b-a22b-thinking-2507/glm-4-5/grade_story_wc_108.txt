<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong ("claustrophobia and cleithrophobia warred"), but seashell's "Dear child" dialogue edges into therapeutic label-speak during peak crisis, risking the -0.4 diagnostic penalty despite otherwise embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost ("relinquish iron control"), but backstory reflection violates BRR limits with two blocks (mentor reveal + identity shift) exceeding 20% without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stars enable decryption and library rust constrains movement, but "decaying books forming protective barrier" remains generic symbolism without altering Maya's choices or tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through decryption pressure with visible cost (surrendering control), yet "vulnerability is power" mantra feels stated rather than earned through specific action until the final confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; final image reweights seashell from "torturous" to "whispered ancient approval," making vulnerability's power resonant without abstraction—no thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("phosphorescent glow from constellations"), but "transformative betrayal" is stock phrasing that weakens authenticity during high-stakes reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No major loops, but "trembling certainty" repetition and "heart pounding" cliché slightly dilute propulsion; final line avoids sentimentality with concrete action ("pressed seashell against her heart").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden stunt double transforms "secret heir" trope, but "The Production" as shadowy org feels derivative; specificity in decryption method elevates freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
