<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via methodical process vs. sleep-deprived vulnerability; "fingers trembled" embodies cost. Thematic echo in "kindness was humanity's oldest language" risks diagnostic label-speak (-0.4).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands: mural reweights premise with conceptual cost (fragility of connection in smog-choked anonymity). Dawn’s approach narrows options, but "tomorrow night" slightly softens the felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting actively constrains choices: smog motivates rooftop sanctuary, moonlight enables daydreams, jasmine scent grounds the whisper scene. "Saffron quiet" charges the final image with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens—dawn’s approach tightens time pressure—but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. Physical exhaustion implied ("fingers trembled") lacks escalation into tangible sacrifice under mounting stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "tributaries of a great river" mural imagery. Avoids moralizing; final image of waiting kindness reweights prior material. "Oldest language" phrasing skirts thematic echo but stays grounded in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in linguistic precision ("waxing moon’s presence") and tactile details ("specially prepared canvas"). "Methodically hopeful" tell-not-show slightly dilutes interiority in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Languages don’t just disappear... They sleep" is thematic echo in final paragraph (-0.6). "Saffron quiet" repetition creates synonym churn; otherwise vivid prose with strong rhythm. Artifacts in closure beat cap high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic anthropology and insomnia-driven artistry. Transforms "artist as savior" trope through Accumulative structure and moonstone brush specificity. Rooftop/smog setting edges toward familiar but gains depth via micro-setting pressure.</comment>
