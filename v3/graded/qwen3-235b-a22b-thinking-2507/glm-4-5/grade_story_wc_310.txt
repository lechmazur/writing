<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Quiet enthusiasm shown via coin handling but "stellar doubt" is label-only emotion; Korin's underutilization weakens relationship crucible; epiphany lacks contradictory impulses despite micro-choices with coins.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing works (spiral = rebirth), but Orientation Test fails: "ambered observatory deck" anchor delayed to para 3 (-0.3); cost ("contraction zenith") visible but not viscerally embodied in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coins function as micro-setting that constrains choice (casting lots) and charges closure (humming energy); observatory's amber light fracturing lacks tangible pressure on decisions despite vivid textural density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival vs. witnessing death) clear early, but escalation lacks causal pressure—Korin's doubt is sole complication; "accelerating contraction" stated not shown, failing band guardrail for visible price charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through spiral coins reweighting contraction as rebirth; avoids moralizing but "symphony of human experience" borders on thematic echo, narrowly avoiding Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("cosmic amber glow," static crackles) but "stellar doubt" cliché disrupts voice; Korin's dialogue functional yet indistinct, lacking subtext-driven goal pursuit under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean grammar but scaffold evident ("Loran's quiet enthusiasm had sustained him..."); template cadence in para 4-5 ("Loran arranged... Loran began...") dulls immediacy; final "ashes" image slightly clichéd yet redeemed by closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh coin-casting ritual elevates cosmic rebirth trope, but "backwards prophecy" feels derivative; emotional specificity in Loran's focus lacks bold risk-taking to reach 8.5+ despite coherent synthesis.</comment>
