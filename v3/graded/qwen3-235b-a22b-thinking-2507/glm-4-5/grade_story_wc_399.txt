<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "strangely honest" approach versus necessary isolation; embodied cost in "continuity with the past meant isolation in the present" lands micro-choice stakes without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes with felt cost: "continuity with the past meant isolation" directly forecloses connection; Accumulative lens holds as ritual density builds toward the kinetic parapet's resonance completing the circuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet beneath dunes constrains every choice—from tracing patterns to sensing shifts—and charges the final image where "the echo would never fade" via its "eternal motion," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative lens: ritual intensification narrows options as "prophet's diminishing aura" forces urgency, with cost legible in "isolation in the present" crystallizing stance during consecration's peak silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (consecrating clearings) not moralizing; final image of "truth [growing] wild like flowers" reweights wisdom's preservation as organic rather than didactic, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("peripheral awareness," "saw between worlds") creates distinct texture; rhythmic control shifts from ritual cadence to sparse dawn departure without head-hopping, teaching pattern early with "strangely honest" lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density where "conjured clearings they could manifest between realities" does triple duty as setting/concept/stakes; no figurative muddle even in peak ritual beats like "echo of wisdom flowing through them."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms preservation trope through specific mechanics (kinetic parapet, peripheral awareness); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "strangely honest" inflection grounding the mystical premise.</comment>
