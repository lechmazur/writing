<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("homesick" vs "playground of possibility") embodied through "interiorizing exteriors" practice; micro-choice of drawing pendant's energy avoids over-tidy epiphany. "Dimensionally homesick" label risks therapy-speak but saved by scaled-chest warmth and crystalline petal shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("stepped forward... path unclear") with felt cost (dissolved dimensional boundaries); Accumulative lens holds through light-boundary porosity. Orientation Test passed via "frozen garden shrouded in mist" anchor at 35 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen roses' crystalline petals shifting color physically constrain the guardian's perception and charge the finale; mist's oscillation enables dimensional superimpositions. Micro-setting (pendant's warmth against scaled chest) directly alters tactics during energy absorption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (dimensional exile vs belonging) escalate through pendant's warming and light-bending; agency shown via active waiting and energy-drawing. Cost (identity dissolution into "belonging everywhere") legible but moral calculus lacks competing goods depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Home as state of consciousness" emerges organically from garden transformation, not moralizing. Final image ("transformed into another page") reweights "boundaries as invitations" without stated thesis; avoids thematic echo via crystalline petal physics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light bent itself in impossible ways") reflects guardian's dimensionally fluid POV; rhythmic control peaks with "dissolved into foggy lucidity" during climax. Minor register drift in "dimensionally homesick" phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "crystalline petals shifting from pure white to indigo" shows multi-sensory specificity. "Foggy lucidity" repetition borders paraphrase but pays off in closure image. Final line's "cosmic library" avoids purple prose through concrete antecedent ("infinite library").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian" trope via interiorizing exteriors mechanic; cosmic library concept gains freshness through frozen garden's physical laws. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth in "homesickness as playground".</comment>
