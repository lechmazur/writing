<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (excavation vs integration) drives credible change; embodied emotions avoid therapy-speak as coffee rings reveal method under pressure. Final renunciation of wound-opening earned by plant whispers and scar-pattern realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: Elara abandons closure-seeking for integration, shown via warm hourglass and changed reflection. Accumulative lens holds through pattern-density escalation to tunnel discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coffee rings constrain choice (pressing wall intersection) and charge final image (reflection in coffee); tower stones as scars directly enable tunnel access. Micro-setting functions as essential pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s pattern-deciphering agency; dominant conflict (excavation vs integration) forecloses wound-opening path with cost shown in her transformed reflection. Escalation via sensory density shift to tunnel discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: coffee rings reweight "healing isn’t opening wounds but living within stories." Final image (smiling at coffee reflection) resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing spirals in coffee, plant telepathy) modulates under stress; rhythmic control in "meteor hush" sequences avoids elision pitfalls. Voice remains anchored in character-specific observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "frosted hourglass began to glow" crystallizes tension without loops. Minor repetition ("closure seeker" phrasing) avoids scaffold; final image ("creator of new beginnings") recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time travel via coffee-ring cartography; transforms tropes through specific emotional calculus (scars as survival testaments). Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
