<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arion’s motivation to discover resilience is clear and action-driven, but interior contradiction remains underdeveloped; his epiphany about the arrow tip lacks prior struggle or visible flaw compounding choices. Micro-choices like following water flow reveal professional competence, yet emotional progression feels streamlined without layered irrationality. Final endurance (returning with knowledge) earns stakes but misses deeper character-specific cost beyond physical strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Arion grasps the arrow tip’s evolutionary role, with cost legible in the inversion’s physical toll ("bracing," "dread and wonder"). Orientation anchors immediately via "orchard planet Verdantis" and "Hour of Inversion." Causal lens holds flawlessly: water navigation enables reaching echoes, which reconfigure resilience understanding. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating arches and inversion constrain choices (e.g., rivers as "aerial roads"), charging the final image of trees settling into soil. Micro-setting of the arrow tip directly enables climax discovery. Minor generic phrasing ("deafening void") slightly dilutes specificity, but sensory details like "silver serpents" and "crystals catching light" reflect urgency. Environment actively shapes tactics without static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (source of resilience) tightens via inversion’s physical escalation: rivers invert → trees lift → arrow glows → echoes reveal truth. Agency drives pressure (Arion navigates water flow to reach First Arch), but resolution lacks tangible trade-off; no credible loss alters tactics. Cost is felt (inversion’s strain) but not visibly paid beyond relief at reset. One meaningful deepening suffices for length, yet escalation edges toward convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: arrow tip’s glow shows resilience in action, echoes reveal adaptation without moralizing. Final image ("orchard planet breathing easier") reweights the premise non-literally, avoiding sentimentality. "Knowledge that would transform agriculture" slightly tips toward tell, but earned wisdom arises from visceral inversion experience. Complexity lingers via unspoken costs of future cultivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "silver serpents" and "ancient resonance" of arches, but emotional descriptors occasionally lapse into labels ("dread and wonder"). Rhythmic control falters under peak stress with repetitive "whirling silence" phrasing. Voice modulates moderately during inversion, though micro-choices lack deeper character-specific bias. No head-hopping, but compression in reflection weakens present-frame immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion via verbs like "tear free" and "throbbed," with paragraph rhythm matching inversion’s chaos. Minor scaffold in triple "whirling silence" repetitions slightly dulls closure’s charge. No figurative muddle, but "deafening void" borders on cliché. Final line ("Verdantis would thrive") resonates cleanly. No loops or register drift in critical beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms gravity-inversion tropes through orchard ecology and water-navigation logic; specificity of "resilient fruit beneath floating arches" avoids abstraction. Arrow tip as evolutionary fragment feels fresh, though "gathering of echoes" leans familiar. Emotional truth in adaptation theme outweighs surface novelty. Risk-taking heightens stakes via inversion’s physical peril, but conceptual integrity lacks bold moral ambiguity.</comment>
