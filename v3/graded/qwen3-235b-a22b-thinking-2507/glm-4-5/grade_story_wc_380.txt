<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in trembling hands and micro-choice to dig despite sand resistance; no therapy-speak as tears fill her eyes recognizing brother's image within crystal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with visible cost: "carefully reburied the crystal" forecloses extraction but enables visits, made legible through physical action and resonant dawn return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Salt crystal chamber constrains choice (digging site) and charges final image; "reburied crystal" with wildflower marker transforms micro-setting into indispensable closure anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure escalates through coffee grounds' "spiraling patterns" to resistant sand, narrowing options to visitation; cost crystallized in "can't remove memories" realization with tactile consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reburial and "bringing coffee" ritual; final image reweights "nothing lost, only transformed" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in brother's silent presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "geometric crystals climbed like frozen light" and stress-tightened syntax ("Suddenly, her shovel hit"); zero head-hopping as "gleaming silence" modulates from comfort to charged resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "swirling three times counterclockwise" shows obsession efficiently; final line "bridging worlds with each light she touched" recharges lantern motif with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through gravity-pocket physics; whale's beaching creates literal anomalies, making "salt crystal" irreplaceable for closure's emotional charge.</comment>
