<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fingers trembled" vs. "renewed focus," but motivation ("help others") lacks prior behavioral proof beyond told backstory. "Strange affliction" label edges toward clinical phrasing under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: quill-tip shedding signifies success with visible cost (exhausted tea ceremony space amid storm). Orientation crystal-clear by word 10. Platform tilt slightly coincidental but doesn't break Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea vapor "coiling like miniature dragons" and crystallizing skin constrain choices, charging final image. Micro-setting (quill tip, shed memory) directly enables transformation. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—tea steam noted early, only breath mentioned during panic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via atmospheric pressure (storm vibrations → platform tilt), but escalation lacks protagonist agency. Panic trigger feels externally imposed rather than earned from her actions. Single deepening (grandmother ritual) suffices for length but costs 0.3 for passive escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: scars become "warning rune," crystallization halted by "impossible knots." Final image reweights "breath between tempests" as transformed wisdom without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: academic precision ("meticulously trimmed tip") fraying into sensory urgency ("telltale prickle"). Voice modulates perfectly under stress—sentences shorten during panic. No head-hopping; single-POV consistency flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but "breath held" recurs with slight variation (words 72, 128, 170), triggering paraphrase-loop penalty. High density maintained: "vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons" compresses atmosphere and tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "healing trauma" trope through specific magic-system constraints (crystallization, rune syntax). Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural structure pays off—storm pressure accumulates without causal beats. "Impossible knots" superstition feels lived-in, not quirky.</comment>
