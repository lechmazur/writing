<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite calm demeanor; "transmuting pain" lacks embodied contradiction. Flaws don't compound choices—Elara's competence feels frictionless under pressure, missing genuine struggle required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost (map case "lighter in spirit"), but vine-climbing time lacks tangible pressure escalation. Missing one visible price altering tactics precludes 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lavender field charges the final image ("air thickened with healing"), yet functions atmospherically rather than constraining choices. Factory ruins shift from decay to resilience symbolically but don't alter tactics, capping below 8.5.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collective healing) signaled early, but pressure escalates through ritual arrangement without narrowing options. No credible loss or moral calculus; stakes remain abstractly hopeful, lacking the visceral trade-off demanded for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("beauty from deepest pain") triggers -0.7 penalty. Insights feel earned through ritual, but "masterpiece of shared understanding" oversimplifies complexity, violating organic emergence requirement for high bands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("subtle arcs only she could perceive") sustains voice through stress. Minor register drift in "transmuting pain" but rhythmic control during ritual arrangement earns high band; no head-hopping despite group presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sweet fragrance... cleanse the very air" shows textural specificity. "Perceptively calm" slightly drifts into label-speak but avoids therapy clichés in peak beats, meeting high-band line craft thresholds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-healer avoids trope clichés, yet "dove gray map case" feels curated for prompt rather than necessity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes but lacks the irreplaceable detail demanded for 8.5+.</comment>
