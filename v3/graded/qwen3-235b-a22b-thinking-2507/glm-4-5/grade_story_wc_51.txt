<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks concrete manifestation; "boundary-lessly trapped" is stated but not dramatized through micro-choices during the pivotal self-burden calcification where hesitation should manifest. No visible trade-off when continuing the ritual despite exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost: "boundary-lessly trapped" reframed as witness-gift amid calcified burdens. Orientation Test passed immediately with bronze grotto/kerosene lamp. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through layered hush and calcification patterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bronze grotto actively constrains choices—starlight alignment dictates calcification success, forcing repositioning during flickering lamp scene. Whalebone ledger's texture cools fingers during farmer's burden, charging final image of "collected light" as essential micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite vivid imagery; "boundary-lessly trapped" trait never creates concrete tactical obstacle (e.g., no struggle to stabilize during self-burden calcification). Escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure shift—the ancient burden vision resolves without earned causal progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through calcification-as-history ("burdens that would otherwise be lost"), but final line "boundary-lessly connected" states the insight where image should resonate. Avoids moralizing by showing understanding through collected weights rather than declaring meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") modulates under pressure—sentences compress during farmer's burden ("felt heavier, denser"). Patterned elision of off-page burdens taught early and paid off in layered silences at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "crystallization" metaphor sustains physical logic throughout. Minor cadence dip in self-burden sequence ("fractal within fractal") slightly dulls immediacy, but "kerosene lamp burner flickered" maintains propulsion. Final image’s "collected light" avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms burden-collector trope through geological metaphors (calcification, strata) and "shingled hush" as active silence. Derivative risk in "fractal weaver" title avoided by never explaining mechanics—focus stays on tangible ritual stakes. Risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
