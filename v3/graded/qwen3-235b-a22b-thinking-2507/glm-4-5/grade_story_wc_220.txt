<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silas's bloodhound-specific perception drives concrete micro-choices (studying grooves through leaf), but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation to find Elara feels earned yet undershadowed by puzzle-solving over deeper internal conflict during pivotal moments like the course adjustment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully with the leafs' combined message redefining "closeness," but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—adjusting northeast feels like puzzle progression rather than narrowing options under causal pressure, missing a true mid-story deepening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The waxed leaf functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices (decoding grooves) and charging the final image; however, the scrapyard's atmospheric details ("tarpaulins shifting") don't actively pressure decisions beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the cylinder's riddle, with the northeast course shift narrowing options, but conflict remains externalized—Silas's journey lacks internal tension between want (find Elara) and fear, reducing emotional stakes despite physical hardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the leafs' reunion revealing "Home is not a place," avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "distance" through shared knowledge, but secondary stakes about survival aren't integrated deeply enough for full thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice excels with bloodhound-specific perception ("tinted revelations," "color changes of buried flesh"), yet minor register drift occurs in abstract phrases like "conceptual cost" that feel outside Silas's lexicon during high-stakes decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("swept dust," "hollowed the world"), but synonym loops ("wax-preserved leaf" → "waxed leaf" → "leaf") and overused "wild hush" slightly dilute momentum in mid-journey beats without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bloodhound traits with post-war decoding feels inevitable, but risks hedging—avoiding deeper flaws in Silas (e.g., grief over past failures) keeps emotional truth at arm's length despite the resonant closure.</comment>
