<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied trauma responses (copper taste of fear, proprioceptive tremors) but near-diagnostic epiphany "mercy is function of time over pain" risks over-articulation in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: strap slipping as "final piece settles" crystallizes options through ultraviolet forest's active pressure; Accumulative lens holds with pattern break at alignment moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as indispensable micro-setting: its light constrains decoding the strap's math and charges the final image; "bark glowing faintly" evolves into critical resource for revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: proprioceptive tremors become coordinates for memory navigation, culminating in the strap alignment that forecloses reliance on trauma; cost legible in relinquishing the physical symbol.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete math metaphor without moralizing; final line "survival was first variable" offers conceptual repricing but "mercy isn't absence of pain" borders on thematic echo mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: "inhaling shards of glass" for breath, proprioception as "compass pointing toward pain"; rhythm modulates from staccato tremors to lyrical realization without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in therapist reference ("his therapist had said...") summarizes without altering tactics; otherwise high density with zero loops—every phrase advances psychological state or forest mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes interrogation trauma with mathematical penance through ultraviolet forest; "mathematics of mercy" concept transforms tropes via specific proprioceptive calculus that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
