<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amelia's "desperate need" to rediscover joy manifests in embodied micro-choices (brushing cobblestones, adjusting lamps), but her internal shift from despair to fulfillment lacks granular struggle in pivotal discovery moments, slightly diluting earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "her purpose had found its way home" crystallizes her arc with visible cost (initial despair transformed into communal rebirth), under a coherent Causal lens where every action—from fragment discovery to exhibition—drives tangible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fog-choked orchard and light-therapy kit function as micro-settings that constrain choices (e.g., fog necessitates her method) and charge the final image ("fog-bound hearts"), while sensory details like "smooth and cool" cobblestones anchor urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from personal ("desperate need") to communal ("entire community" renewal), with Amelia's exhibition forcing a trade-off (artistic vulnerability for connection); cost is unmistakable in the "hope took root where despair had grown" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the "exposed film" metaphor evolves from technical observation to communal rebirth, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("art illuminated fog-bound hearts") resonates as a non-literal answer to "lost joy" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in artist-specific diction ("impossible colors," "liquid dawn"), but "knowledge network" momentarily drifts into abstract register during high-pressure discovery, slightly disrupting voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful specificity ("baskets overflowing with fruit"), though "documented each revelation, building a knowledge network" introduces scaffold that dilutes momentum in a critical beat without advancing action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "art heals community" trope through concrete mechanics (light-therapy kit, "exposed film" concept) and emotional specificity—children pressing noses to walls, elderly weeping—avoiding sentimentality while synthesizing freshness from familiar elements.</comment>
