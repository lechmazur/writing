<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("fingers traced the delicate weft thread") with contradictory impulses (writing others' obituaries while avoiding self-confrontation). Micro-choices like uncapping the pen reveal hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "healing geography" concept prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: carpet thread transforms from "anchor and burden" to "compass pointing toward wholeness" with undeniable emotional cost ("his own explained absence becoming clearer"). Accumulative lens holds throughout with density increase in final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shadowed garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (sensory saturation guiding projection method). Carpet thread charges final image as "tiny pathway." Minor generic autumn tropes ("leaves danced like spirits") prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening reflection as traveler moves from Thomas's obituary to his own, narrowing options via agency. Cost crystallizes in "something beautiful and painful was beginning to heal within his geography of self" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through carpet thread's evolving symbolism; final image ("compass pointing toward wholeness") offers resonant non-literal answer to "explained absences" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while reweighting premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in sensory hierarchy (notices "decay" over blooms). Rhythmic control shines in high-pressure closure beats. Minor register drift in "geography of healing" phrasing prevents 9.0 despite otherwise exemplary voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose largely propulsive with purposeful fragments ("After the last ship had sailed..."). One paraphrase loop in "explaining of absences—the parts of people..." slightly dulls momentum. No closure-impacting artifacts; vivid textural specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "writer protagonist" trope through obituary-for-the-living conceit. Emotional specificity in "lonesome splendor" avoids cliché. Risk-taking in quiet conceptual closure pays off, though autumn garden setting lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
