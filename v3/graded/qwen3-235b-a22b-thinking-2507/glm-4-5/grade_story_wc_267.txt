<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "safety wasn't absence of danger, but courage to face what threatened what you loved," with embodied emotion via numb fingers tracing melodies. Minor flaw: accident backstory slightly over-told without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: snow "dancing with newfound rhythm" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost of broken silence. Orientation flawless; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density build to humming walls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Piano bench bolt constrains choice (discovery triggers climax) and charges final image ("bolt grew warm in his palm"). Cobalt fortress isn't backdrop—its "seraphically mundane" texture actively shapes the sacrifice motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: discoloration → etchings → humming walls narrows options to singing or silence. Cost is visceral—"fingers still numb" singing anyway—undermining safety's false promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from particulars: "unpardonable silence" embodied in bolt etchings, not stated. Final snow-dance image reweights safety/artistic cost without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Choir-trained perceptual signature defines voice ("ethereal blue light that matched fortress walls," "fragments of melody notation"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato sentences during bolt discovery, lyrical flow at singing climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frostbitten hope" specificity avoids purple prose. Minor deduction: "seraphically mundane" slightly elevated but justified by character's artistic lens. Final line's "danced with newfound rhythm" delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's sacrifice" trope via nerve regeneration detail and piano bolt specificity. Emotional truth in "fingers still numb... sang the first note" avoids sentimentality, but safety-middle hedging slightly softens risk.</comment>
