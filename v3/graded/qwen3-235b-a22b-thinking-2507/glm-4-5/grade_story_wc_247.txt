<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in joyful sorrow drives micro-choices; embodied emotion via crinkled eyes translating tear-streaked silence. Flaws: "joyful sorrow" borders on label-speak despite contextualization, slightly softening the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—dawn departure crystallizes cost of being forgotten while harbor sings. Escalation via accumulating silences (woman, fisherman, child) tightens the textural lens. No orientation debt; lens inferred by para 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor's moonlight patterns constrain Elias' gestures ("mirrored translating visual symphony"), charging the final image. Micro-setting (camera as compass/tool) shapes all choices. Avoids white-room syndrome through salt-tinged air and lapping water choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (being heard vs. forgotten) tighten through Elias' mapping of gathered silences. Cost crystallizes in "he would remain wordless in their memories." Agency-driven escalation via sign language choices, but secondary stake (preserving mother's legacy) lacks mid-scene friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "joyful sorrow" motif: final image reweights silence as music with conceptual cost (erasure). No moralizing; ambiguity in "perfect harmony" avoids tidy binaries. Mother's backstory earns thematic resonance through camera inheritance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "mapping silence like invisible threads" filters harbor details through Elias' sign-language lens. Rhythmic control peaks in symphony metaphor ("each gesture was a note"). Avoids head-hopping despite multiple observers via stable single-POV focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("vintage camera, though filmless, captured emotions not images"). Deducted 0.2 for "scattered diamonds" cliché and minor figurative muddle ("invisible threads"), though payoff in final image saves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "translator of silence" trope via sign language + filmless camera synthesis. Emotional specificity in "tear-streaked cheeks" avoids genericity. Caps at 8.7 per high-band gate (Q2<9.0), though risk-taking (textural closure) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
