<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("hauntingly optimistic") without embodied contradiction; sleepwalking removes agency, obscuring genuine struggle. No visible cost in pivotal moments—exhaustion noted but not dramatized as trade-off against her mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (art transforming heritage), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational—undermining escalation. Cost proof fails: orchid growth lacks felt sacrifice, with villagers' discovery resolving tension too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Canyon walls actively constrain choices—thread "overlapping ancient carvings" on harsh stone—charging the final image where "whispers" echo footsteps. Micro-setting (needle/thread) drives transformation, fulfilling 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("ruin to reverence") without concrete escalation; villagers' passive observation adds no pressure. Sleepwalking mechanics prevent meaningful tightening—no narrowing of options or trade-offs despite exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "orchid solace" motif charging the canyon's transformation, but final paragraph's explicit "weave connections" moralizing undercuts subtlety. Avoids sentimentality yet lacks non-literal resonance in closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice has lyrical texture ("mist curled like sleeping serpents"), but POV slips into omniscience ("villagers noticed") and clinical register ("hauntingly optimistic"). Perceptual signature weakens under pressure—no craft-specific bias in descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose loops ("overlapping" x4) and overwritten closure ("thread and needle, with dreams and determination") dull momentum. Orchid solace repetition in final beats creates scaffold; rhythmic monotony undermines peak emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism tropes via specific canyon-sewing mechanics and tide-pool discovery, but "ruin to reverence" premise feels generic. Risk-taking in poetic prose elevates stakes without gimmickry, though emotional specificity lacks depth.</comment>
