<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; motivation clear but no visible struggle beyond "frustrated many before her." Micro-choices lack hierarchy of values—discarding assumptions feels effortless, not earned through prior causality with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: towers humming with "renewed purpose" crystallizes cosmic rebirth with conceptual cost. But felt cost remains abstract—no visceral sacrifice (e.g., exhaustion, injury) beyond temporary silence, weakening the stakes at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned radio tower constrains choice critically: steel resonance enables tuning, gorge wind demands shard of hush. Final image—"suspended city to its peaceful slumber"—charges closure through micro-setting pressure, satisfying 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via lunar perigee’s temporal pressure, but escalation lacks visible price: "discarding assumptions" requires no tangible forfeiture. Agency drives deepening focus, yet cost feels intellectual rather than embodied, failing the Q2 cost proof test for higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "beginning in every ending" crystallizes via the tuned fragment’s cosmic map. Final line reweights prior material without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo. Subtext in silence-as-creation elevates resonance beyond abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "serenely electric energy pulsed in rhythm with her heartbeat" filters cosmos through embodied focus. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—short sentences during tuning ("She closed her eyes")—with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn dilutes peak beats: "serenely electric" recurs identically (fragment’s "pulse," aura’s "expansion"). No closure-dulling artifacts, but stacked descriptors in high-pressure moments prevent 8.5+ propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio towers and cosmic debris avoids trope clichés. "Shard of hush" transforms noise-as-barrier into practical tool, heightening stakes through specific logic. Emotional truth in quiet triumph resists sentimentality.</comment>
