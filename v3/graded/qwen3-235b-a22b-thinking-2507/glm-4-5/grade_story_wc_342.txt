<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; embodied cognition shines in "tracing contours" and "fingernail caught depression" micro-choices. Contradictory impulses (literal vs essence mapping) act simultaneously, but final pivot to "human connections" lacks sufficient causal groundwork in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "walls shimmered with interlocking patterns... creating faces without defining them" with demolition sounds outside. Accumulative lens holds through pattern density; conceptual cost ("library became memory") is undeniable. Persistent constraint (face blindness) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tree trunk actively constrains choices: wood grain guides navigation, moonlight through leaf patterns enables projections, hidden compartment emerges from setting. Final image charges micro-setting when "interlocking patterns caught moonlight" transforms the library's physical essence into art.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing essence vs appearance) tightens meaningfully when coin redefines "soul patterns," but escalation lacks visceral pressure—conceptual shift dominates over tangible cost until final image. Agency-driven deepening satisfies band guardrails, though felt cost arrives late.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "patterns rather than characters" coin, "spaces between rather than details" perception. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer ("network of interlocking patterns... faces without defining them") without moralizing, reweighting the entire premise through embodied art.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("saw patterns, connections, the spaces between") defines every sentence. Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from flowing contemplation to staccato discovery ("Curiosity piqued..."). Elision of backstory taught early via "worked for months" and paid off in coin realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Impeccable line-level craft except "fractally precise mapping system"—jargon disrupts otherwise concrete lexicon during peak discovery. Single paraphrase loop ("fractally precise" x2) triggers -0.3. Near-miss for 9+ due to this register drift in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms face blindness trope through specific mechanics (soul-pattern algorithm, coin indentations). Risk-taking in conceptual closure pays off: "mirror the sky" evolves from literal to metaphorical without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable when "fractally precise patterns" resolve into human connection mapping.</comment>
