<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("logical mind warred with dreaming heart") manifest in embodied micro-choices like trembling hands adjusting pebbles during the gauge's spin. Final transformation earned by causality but "revitalize" motivation stays abstract without personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("subtle reordering of possibilities") when gauge points outward. Orientation perfect (grotto anchored by para 1), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the gauge acts upon Elian rather than his choices driving change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto actively constrains choices: retreating water reveals surfaces, bioluminescent algae responds to movement. Final image of pulsing walls directly charges closure, meeting 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revitalizing possibility) remains abstract without visceral stakes. Pressure grows texturally but lacks tangible cost—no tradeoffs shown when "subtle reordering" occurs. Escalation insufficient under Accumulative lens per Q4 quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "prismatic glass becoming conduits," avoiding moralizing. Final gauge image reweights "currents we cannot control" into navigable hope without stated moral, perfectly fulfilling Q5 quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "kaleidoscopic light" filtered through a pattern-seer's eyes. Under pressure, syntax compresses ("Time seemed to dissolve") while maintaining logical precision—distinct rhythmic control meets Q6 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-closure abstraction ("subtle reordering of possibilities") slightly dulls propulsion. Avoids loops and scaffold, but "conceptual interference" borders academic register in high-pressure beat, costing 0.2 per Overwriting Checks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "parallel timelines" trope through specific physics of hope ("calibrated pebbles," "equations of hope"). Emotional truth in "logical dreamer" synthesis avoids quirkiness, meeting Q8 9+ quick test with risk-taking that heightens coherence.</comment>
