<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prophet's embodied motivation ("obstacles into instruments") drives action, but lacks contradictory impulses—no moment of doubt or irrationality during storm. Emotional progression too smooth, missing layered cost beyond "humming driftwood." Micro-choices under pressure (rapid mallet strikes) effectively reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (orchard's silent journey embodying fragile harmony), but storm diversion lacks causal proof—feels coincidental, not earned by her actions. Orientation strong ("driftwood circle," "blue hour" anchored by 80 words), lens (Accumulative/Textural) consistent through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftwood orchard functions as micro-setting: roots conducting vibrations constrain choices (securing home) and charge closure ("silent journey"). Sensory specificity vivid but over-reliant on visual; "mercury ocean" lacks tactile grounding. Environment directly shapes tactics during storm sequence, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (surviving storms) escalate via cloud formation, but prophet's musical intervention resolves threat without visible trade-off—no cost (e.g., exhaustion, damaged instruments) to narrow options. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, yet missing felt price that should charge final image per band guardrails for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("dubbing clouds into resonance"), not statement. Final image of children with mallets reweights "obstacles as instruments" with generational cost, avoiding moralizing. Nearly stumbles with "self-similar patterns" abstraction but saved by concrete "crescent moon hook" closure linkage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractal generating shapes," "sketched resonance") with rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during storm ("Her mallet moved in rapid succession"). Consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Minor register drift with "restless euphony" slightly jars prophet's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High propulsion with varied syntax, but "sketched resonance" looped 3x in 5 lines creates synonym churn. Final paragraph scaffold ("The ocean currents might shift... but resonance would persist") dulls closure image. No figurative muddle, but density issues prevent 9.0+ per quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology/music therapy tropes through "driftwood as instrument." Risk-taking (sound diverting storms) heightens stakes, though physics strains credibility. Emotional specificity avoids genericity, but "blue hour" and "fractal" verge on familiar poetic devices without full transformation.</comment>
