<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Maya's dual identity, but "unyielding compassion" remains abstract rather than demonstrated through conflicting impulses during key choices. Diagnostic phrase "scars can sing" risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied struggle in the grafting climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure as Maya witnesses intact grafts at dawn with surrounding destruction, charging cost through "black sand connecting past to present." However, cloud migration functions as convenient environmental coincidence rather than earned escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand function as micro-settings that charge closure: volcanic sand literally nourishes roses while lagoon mirrors transformation. "Kelp-drift peace" lacks tactile specificity but final silver-black moonlight image powerfully reweights legacy through concrete reflection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving grafts vs fire) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Maya reacts to weather shifts rather than driving conflict. Cloud migration tightens pressure, yet cost remains environmental (surrounding destruction) rather than altering her tactics mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete grafting scars and transformed black sand, avoiding moralizing. Final image of roses with "beauty enhanced by survival marks" delivers resonant CR without stated moral, though "scars can sing" borders on thematic echo in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines through firefighter-botanist duality (prioritizing ember trajectories vs graft unions), but "kelp-drift peace" feels forced. Rhythmic control excels in fire-blanket climax, though repetitive "as" constructions slightly dull high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "gracefully alert" repetition (3x) and "migration of clouds" phrasing verge on synonym loops. Final lagoon image avoids cliché with "silver-black" specificity, though "tapped against her chest" lacks fresh embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighting/botany metaphors through volcanic setting avoids arsonist-fighter clichés. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via Charged Poise closure, though "scars can sing" concept leans toward familiar resilience tropes without sufficient grit.</comment>
