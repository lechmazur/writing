<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (analytical vs. sentimental) emerges late via mentor memory, but "secretly sentimental" is told not shown through prior action; emotional embodiment remains abstract ("heart beating in rhythm") without specific physicality during pivotal transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with crystal's transformation reconfiguring options, but cost remains conceptual (implied future stakes) without visceral on-page forfeiture; "final transformation" looms but lacks felt immediacy to satisfy Q2's cost-proof test for higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Waterfall/orchard creates vivid atmosphere but fails to constrain choices—Elara could perform ritual anywhere; micro-setting potential in dew crystal/locket is underutilized for tactical pressure despite charging the final image with intensified rainbows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (harmonizing logic/intuition) are clear but escalation relies on atmospheric coincidence (starlings "as if summoned") rather than protagonist agency; cost feels deferred to off-page "final transformation," weakening the on-page trade-off required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through crystal/starling synergy but "touch of wonder" is stated not earned; resolution avoids moralizing yet lacks meaningful ambiguity—the harmonization feels too tidy, missing the complex friction promised by Elara's contradictions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("molten copper" hair, prismatic spray) shines, but uniform lyrical diction persists under ritual pressure without stress-induced compression; rhythm remains steady when it should fracture to mirror her scientific/intuitive tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Redundant sensory escalation ("halo around her face"/"kaleidoscopic display intensified") creates paraphrase loops; template cadence ("She carried... Before... Her motivation...") dulls momentum in high-stakes ritual beats where syntax should fracture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/starling patterns elevates tropes, but emotional specificity falters—Elara's sentimentality lacks concrete stakes, and "harmonizing logic/intuition" remains a familiar premise without bold moral calculus or irreversible cost.</comment>
