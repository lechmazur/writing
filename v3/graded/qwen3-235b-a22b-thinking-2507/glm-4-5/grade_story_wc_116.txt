<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("loose grip on reality" vs. anchoring purpose) powers the Earned Stasis choice, but embodied emotion lacks specificity during the critical refusal of stasis; "frayed edges" borders on label-speak without physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the keeper's return to the river's change while bearing the silence's secret crystallizes the cost of witnessing (healed yet unchanged), but the "frayed edges" metaphor slightly obscures tangible cost at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge and origami swan function as micro-settings that charge the final image (swan's "faint tracings"), yet the river/library environments remain atmospheric backdrops without constraining choices—environmental specificity elevates but falls short of 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the keeper's agency (chronicling the anomaly), with the silence's temptation creating authentic tension; the cost of resisting stasis is felt in the swan's altered state, though the "healing" effect lacks concrete tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the keeper's refusal to succumb to stasis: "bearing witness without judgment" resonates through the final image of the river's change, avoiding moralizing while reweighting entropy as sacred duty via the preserved manuscript.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight fractured through cascading murk," "renewable silence") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift occurs in "impermeable silence" (corporate diction) during high-stakes observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion, but template cadence emerges in the opening ("Sunlight fractured... Their grip... Across the drift...") with three consecutive subject-verb openings, dulling initial momentum without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ingenuity transforms the "witness" trope through tactile specificity (origami swan's "cryptic folds," silence that "mutes decay"), yet the regenerative silence concept risks familiar fantasy mechanics without the keeper's visceral resistance elevating it beyond trope.</comment>
