<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (curse/gift insomnia) shown through embodied choices like tracing postcard, but "photosynthesize pain" veers into diagnostic label-speak (-0.4 deduction). Final endurance lacks visible cost escalation beyond abstract "mortal journey".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via poet's death while lullabies persist, with conceptual cost in "final resting place". Orientation clear by line 3. Lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural pressure (blossom spread) lacks causal tightening; one deepening insufficient for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell's bioluminescent walls constrain choices (lullabies resonate with structure) and charge final image. "Reef-shadow joy" scent concretely embodies sorrow/serenity tension. Micro-setting functions perfectly per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming suffering) signaled early. "Shyly unstoppable" blossoms provide meaningful deepening, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options; passive observation dominates pressure. Cost legible only abstractly in death.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (blossoms inscribed with micro-verse), avoiding moralizing until final line's "reminder that connection exists..." triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.5). Final image reweights longing with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pearlescent walls whispered ancient stories") with rhythmic control. "Half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" shows voice modulating under pressure. No head-hopping, but late register drift in "photosynthesize pain into beauty".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops but "shyly unstoppable" repeats as template cadence (3x) in high-pressure beats (-0.4). Figurative density ("galaxy postcard... tears from distant worlds") risks muddle yet clears payoff. Final image propulsion strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insomnia-as-gift with cosmic ecology. "Blossom armistice" transforms war tropes through specific "reef-shadow joy" details. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but "across centuries" lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
