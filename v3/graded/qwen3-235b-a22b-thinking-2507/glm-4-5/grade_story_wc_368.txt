<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows through concrete dye experiments and light observations, avoiding therapy-speak. But lacks contradictory impulses—Kaelen's curiosity faces no internal resistance, missing the "contradictory impulses acting simultaneously" required for 9+. Donor heart's rhythm syncing with discovery adds embodied motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing: the final image of stories gathering "like moths" reweights narrative magnetism through perspective with conceptual cost (donor legacy lives via adapted stories). Accumulative lens holds as dye experiments build density toward realization. Missing persistent constraint shaping tactics prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Floating tea house functions as micro-setting (prisms enable light experiments), and blue morpho wing charges closure. But environment doesn't actively constrain choices—it's a backdrop rather than pressure source. Dew collection at "6:23 AM" shows specificity yet lacks tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake (understanding narrative magnetism) is signaled early and escalates through Kaelen's agency-driven dye experiments. But cost remains diffuse—"remembered through stories" lacks visceral felt price. Band guardrail for 8.8+ requires visible cost charging final image; here conceptual cost isn't sufficiently dramatized on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the morpho wing's shifting hues as metaphor for perspective. Final image ("stories gathered like moths") resonates without moralizing, reweighting the premise through concrete action (heartbeat-adapted tales). Avoids thematic echo—insights arise from dye experiments, not abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "observing colors with eyes that perceived hues" filters all description through dye master's expertise. Rhythmic control shines in compressed discovery moment ("I am becoming what I seek"). Slight dilution from "valley-mist wonder" abstraction prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly explosive" appears verbatim in both discovery and dye effect moments. Over-explanation near closure ("people magnetize stories not through volume...") reduces density. No artifacts in peak beats, but final line's moth simile leans cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye chemistry and narrative theory via iridescence avoids tropes—transformation test fails if "dye master" becomes "musician." Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though heart-transplant premise slightly familiar. Emotional specificity in "dew at 6:23 AM" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
