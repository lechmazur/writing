<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hard softness") and embodied emotion ("ache in his bones") shine, but "bargained innocence" remains abstract rather than dramatized through specific trade-offs; micro-choices like tracing the fracture reveal values, yet motivation lacks visceral friction early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("scars etched into his skin were merely maps charting that internal terrain"), but late backstory entry (child's scream) summarizes rather than integrates into present pressure, slightly weakening causal escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box functions as perfect micro-setting: its physical constraint (cool weight in pocket) charges the final image ("fracture seem less like damage, more like a deliberate stroke"), directly shaping the protagonist’s reconfigured stance and meeting 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("translate pain into universal language") emerges too late (para 2), lacking early dramatization; escalation deepens through the box’s evolving meaning, but no visible price is paid during the scene—cost remains conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars (porcelain fracture, celestial indifference), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "survival leaves marks" into resonant, non-literal wisdom without stating a moral, achieving pure organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused yet surprisingly gently skilled hands") and rhythmic control excel, but "bargained innocence" introduces academic register drift inconsistent with firefighter’s voice, slightly undermining POV modesty during peak reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("shadows pooled between ancient pines, deepening the profound silence") drives momentum. One borderline therapy-speak phrase ("profound sorrow softened only by...") is saved by context but prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trauma tropes via specific, grounded details (porcelain box as survivor object), avoiding generic heroism; "scars as maps charting internal terrain" offers fresh emotional truth, though moonlit ridge risks cliché without celestial indifference’s grounding.</comment>
