<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "translator between generations" drives action, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "positively wistful" remains label-only without embodied tradeoffs during pivotal music box moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (transformed senior center), but music box's coincidental discovery weakens causal escalation; cost legible in "awkwardly polite interactions" becoming connection, yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Feral loft supplies glass jars that constrain his method, and dunes' shifting sands mirror thematic fluidity; final image of "home in service of others' stories" charged by recurring sensory objects without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging generational divides) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible price: senior center transformation occurs without resistance or tactical shift, failing band guardrail for 8.8+ requiring cost that charges final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars ("gleaned redemption" via shared melody), not abstraction; final image reweights "feral loft" as purposeful home without moralizing, fulfilling non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing ("tiny performers in theater of solitary existence"), but "positively wistful" and "gleaned redemption" drift into elevated diction incongruent with vagrant POV during peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm ("sunlight filtered through cracks... illuminating dust motes dancing"), but "theater of his solitary existence" risks overwriting in high-pressure discovery beat, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-capturing trope with intergenerational healing; "glass prisons" transforms familiar metaphor through specific stakes, though loft setting lacks distinctive verifiable detail to reach 9.0+.</comment>
