<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but "meaning/absolution" summary risks abstraction; contradictory impulses (seeking death vs. tracing parasol) earn closure though micro-choices lack physical stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "tears freezing on her cheeks" and parasol's reweighted meaning crystallize transformation; Accumulative lens holds through ice/solace pattern intensification to Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as active micro-setting—cracking ice directly charges the final image and constrains her reflection; parasol tip's tactile evolution from "farewell" to "bridge" meets 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Marcus questions "the sound you're looking for," forcing Elena's realization; escalation via textural density (wind/ice motifs) reweights "fold in patience" with visible cost in frozen tears and altered parasol meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ice melting = quiet endings, not stated moral; final stars over marina offer resonant answer to "sound of endings" without sentimentality, avoiding Thematic Echo despite "Change doesn't always mean loss" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ivory curve," "ice moaning like living things"; rhythmic control shifts from fragmented ("She clutched...") to flowing ("wind carried solace") under emotional pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("solace" x4, "trawl" x3) prevent 9+; "windborne solace" repetition borders on overwriting but avoids muddle as pattern is taught early and pays off in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tourism via disaster relief lens; specificity of "heirloom lace parasol tip" (not just umbrella) and ice's "hues of orange/pink" creates fresh emotional truth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
