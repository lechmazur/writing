<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "sharp gentleness" stated not embodied. Final choice earned but epiphany lacks struggle, triggering label-speak penalty during timeline revelation where cost isn't physically shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "loyal memory of love" crystallizes options with cost ("vigil continued through the night"). Accumulative lens holds via density increase toward final image; orientation clear by line 3 with "scorched wasteland" anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Faded lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("shaping invisible clay"), but hives/bees remain ornamental. Wildflowers' phototropism doesn't constrain choices despite thematic resonance, missing 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via timeline resolution narrowing Kael's options (must return with others), with visible cost in all-night vigil. Pressure lacks external antagonistic force; escalation relies on internal realization rather than coherent external pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "phototropic to kindness" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("nourish what holds time at bay") offers resonant answer to central question, avoiding abstraction despite "loyal memory of love" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (potter's tactile focus) controls rhythm under pressure. Purposeful elision ("wisps of memory") taught early pays off in closure; no head-hopping. "Hands forming circles" motif sustains voice through escalating thrum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("careful precision... sharp gentleness") dulls immediacy. Zero artifacts in closure beat; propulsion maintained through varied syntax ("Soon, chimney smoke... then flatten"). Figurative language serves density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kindness as literal phototropism transforms trope through potter's tactile worldview. Risk-taking with fractured timelines as visual metaphor heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
