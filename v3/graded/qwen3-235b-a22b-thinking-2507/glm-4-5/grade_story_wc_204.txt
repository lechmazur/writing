<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eldon’s desperate longing versus ink-stained obsession, with micro-choices like trembling placement of the vial revealing hierarchy of values. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak pressure beats, slightly weakening the final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: library’s translucent reformation charges cost through Eldon’s touch on floating words. Accumulative lens holds consistently with frost patterns evolving into final reconfiguration, fulfilling cost-proof test via "knowledge to flow freely" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—the vial’s destabilization warps walls and churning clouds directly shape Eldon’s press designs. Final image of reforming frost charges closure by embodying rebirth, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compressing eternity) tightens through Eldon’s ritual preparation, with rupture forcing irreversible trade-off: sanctuary destruction for awakened knowledge. Cost legible in "cracks branch by branch," though escalation lacks one visceral pressure beat under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "preserved and destroyed" duality crystallizes in final frost patterns as non-literal answer to eternity’s cost. No moralizing; conceptual repricing lands via library’s breathing transformation, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—"frost that formed on transparent branches" filters world through Eldon’s ink-stained urgency. Rhythmic control modulates from lyrical ("condensed light that shifted like breath") to fragmented ("rupture occurred not with explosion but with implosion") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor density issues: "dendritic frost patterns" borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats. Propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs ("vibrated," "rustling," "churning"), though "crystalline vial containing condensed light" slightly bloats closure’s lead-in.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library tropes via negotiable reality premise; emotional specificity in Eldon’s "past that had liquefied" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "bottled whisper" concept slightly echoes known artifacts without full transformation.</comment>
