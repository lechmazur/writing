<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through bottle interaction and manifesto drafting, but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal realization; emotions remain abstract ("heart filled with certainty") without embodied tension. Micro-choices (tracing bottle, sketching plans) reveal values, yet the epiphany feels unearned by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in the hollow lanterns' dawn glow, but reflection exceeds 30% without interleaved micro-choices altering present options—the working memory segment reads as summary, not pressure-driven recall. Orientation perfect, yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: paper lanterns constrain choice by symbolizing hollow beauty and charge the final image, but environment doesn't pressure tactics—bay window workshop feels generic. Sensory details vivid yet over-indexed on visual; weather/location never affect action despite coastal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spiritual revival) signaled early, but pressure stagnates—no on-page reversal or deepening beyond Elior's internal realization. Cost is felt (hollow town) yet not viscerally demonstrated; "false comfort" conflict resolves without concrete opposition or trade-offs, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bottle metaphor and lantern imagery, avoiding moralizing until the final paragraph's near-sermonizing line ("true transformations begin not from wishes..."). Conceptual repricing succeeds, but "reject false comfort" verbatim repetition risks thematic echo, diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in alchemical lexicon ("contained potential," "impenetrable surface"), yet "false comfort" phrasing repeats mechanically like scaffold. Rhythmic control falters in reflection blocks with uniform syntax ("He began to conceive... The ideas flowed..."), though compression serves the contemplative pace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("physical restoration alone could never truly revive... physical improvements without cultural renewal") and overwrought final line ("beacon of rebirth in a fragmented world") sap momentum. Otherwise clean propulsion with vivid specificity; no closure-dulling artifacts but reflection sections suffer template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy as community metaphor avoids tropes through "contained potential" lens, yet ghost town revival premise feels derivative without granular local detail. Risk-taking in quiet closure (no magical solution) elevates, but emotional specificity lacks the grit needed for 9.0+ band.</comment>
