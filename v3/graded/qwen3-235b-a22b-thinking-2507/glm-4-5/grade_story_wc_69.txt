<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "expectantly resigned" persistence; micro-choices like gifting the rosette earn closure with visible cost. Limited by summarized choir tensions reducing embodied conflict during key "unlearning" beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: rosette handover crystallizes cost ("vanishing arts need not disappear") under Accumulative lens. Early orientation (<50 words) and seamless escalation via sensory density avoid common pitfalls.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet library constrains choice (planning sanctuary) and charges final image; rosette's physicality anchors decay/renewal. Autumn-to-spring evolution mirrors thematic shift without cliché. Micro-setting elevates to 9-band threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "subtracting noise" methodology, narrowing options to unity vs. division. Cost legible in transformed choir's "traveled stillness," but summarized tensions weaken on-page escalation of "unlearning hatred" pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rosette's evolution ("seeds of renewal"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights vanishing arts without stating morals. Slightly undermined by "elevates diversity" line bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile musical detail ("fingering aged rosette"); rhythmic control deepens under pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early. Dialogue subtext ("subtracting noise") carries goal-driven indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("traveled stillness" compresses history/emotion). "Expectantly resigned" repetition risks swappability but gains specificity through context. Final beat avoids figurative muddle with concrete rosette transfer.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms choir trope through musical methodology ("subtracting noise") and tangible vanishing arts stakes. Emotional truth in resigned hope avoids sentimentality. Fresh inflection in rosette-as-renewal metaphor, though choir arc leans slightly template-like.</comment>
