<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; "emotionally rational" trait remains label-only without testing under pressure. No moment where rationality conflicts with human cost, missing visceral struggle despite coherent motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clean orientation and ledger discovery as Decisive Change. Conceptual cost (truth's burden) is legible but insufficiently charged; "pit of lies" repetition in final paragraph weakens Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ivy-covered station functions as micro-setting (loose floorboard enables climax) and charges final image. But environment doesn't constrain choices earlier; degradation noted without affecting tactics until discovery beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs noble lies) clear but pressure lacks meaningful tightening. Ledger discovery resolves cleanly without trade-offs; no live option foreclosed or cost altering tactics despite conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Noble lies" theme emerges organically but final paragraph moralizes ("justice for forgotten workers") rather than resonant reconfiguration. Ivy metaphor charges closure but "pit of lies" repetition feels on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Historical texture strong but voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; "emotionally rational" flattens prose into clinical observation. No lexicon shifts under pressure, though period details feel authentic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean propulsion with minor overwriting ("ivy that clawed... perfect metaphor"). "Final petal drops" timing feels forced, and "pit of lies" repetition in closing lines dulls closure image slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of historical mystery tropes with fresh "noble lies" angle. Rosebush timing adds specificity but underutilized; lacks transformative risk-taking despite emotional complexity in premise.</comment>
