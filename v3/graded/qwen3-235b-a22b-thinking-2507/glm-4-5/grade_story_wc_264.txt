<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "dreamless" guard who begins dreaming; micro-choices like placing the clock reveal hierarchy of values. Limited embodied emotion in key beats slightly weakens visceral impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when clock ticks to 00:01—conceptual cost of broken time mending is undeniable. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly with density increase reweighting stakes through the final sprout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glowing dune functions as micro-setting constraining choice (stepping onto pulsing sand) and charges the final image; chess clock's physical presence stabilizes chaotic energy, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation through deepening: "occasionally everywhere" ability transforms from flaw to strength as guard achieves presence. Cost is palpable in the "unfamiliar flutter" when admitting he dreams now.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the sprouting seed reweights "fractured lullaby" without moralizing. Final image ("remembered how to dream") offers resonant answer to central question of broken time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dreamless eyes scanning horizon") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor filter-verb use ("he would find himself") slightly dulls immediacy in one high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ethereal blues and purples that seemed to pulse" exemplifies textural specificity. "Soft luminescence" borders on generic but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via quantum logic—wave functions as emotional metaphor feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
