<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction during key moments; "quietly inspired" is stated but not viscerally felt through micro-choices under pressure. Motivation crystallizes cleanly, yet emotional progression remains tidily rational without irrational layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "wisdom grows when shared" reweights prophecy’s meaning with undeniable social cost in the final image. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—density increases through button patterns to crystallize communal wisdom’s charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber warehouse constrains choices (silence for listening) and charges closure ("unearthed silence deepened"), but sensory details like "amber light" lack POV-filtered specificity. Micro-setting (buttons) powerfully shapes tactics yet misses tactile urgency in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via density increase: button arrangements narrow prophecy from "impossible" to actionable truth. Cost is felt in solitude-to-community shift, though conceptual price lacks visceral weight. Single deepening suffices for length but could heighten emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: button cataloging becomes shared wisdom’s engine. Final image ("wisdom was shared... one button at a time") reweights prophecy without moralizing. No thematic echo—canyon’s whisper remains diegetic, not authorial sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature (measurer of small moments) but rhythmic control falters in high-density sections with repetitive "as she..." constructions. Compression serves Accumulative lens yet slightly dulls immediacy during echo communication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("quietly inspired" reprise) and abstraction ("profound connection") reduce density. No figurative muddle, but "amber warehouse" repetition lacks variation. Final line’s propulsion elevates closure despite mid-story rhythmic uniformity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through button cataloging’s collective wisdom. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—removing buttons collapses logic—but "canyon echo" edges toward symbolic convenience without deeper world logic. Risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
