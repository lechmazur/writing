<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s solitude versus inherited ritual; embodied grief via thumb on stone and ribbon depletion. Final renunciation of individual grief for collective understanding earns closure with visible cost—mentor’s departure and depleted ribbon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: final butterfly image reweights grief’s premise with undeniable cost (ribbon depletion, mentor’s exit). Accumulative lens holds—density of knots/butterflies tightens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ribbon and greenhouse function as micro-settings constraining choices; ribbon’s generational wear and depletion directly charge the closure image. Final "amber wings against ancient glass" crystallizes theme through environment, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: butterfly migration timeframe and ribbon knots narrow options as Elias shifts from measuring stone to carving collective grief. Cost is unmistakable—depleted ribbon and mentor’s departure reconfigure his purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—knots as poem stanzas, butterflies as grief patterns—avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights "shape of grief" non-literally, rejecting sentimentality for earned resonance in the monument’s power.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "dust motes like unsettled spirits," feels "thunder beneath calm." Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical during reflection, compressed under pressure ("Elias closed his eyes, listening") without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story. "Amber wings catching last light" does triple duty (sensory, symbolic, temporal). Closure beat pristine—no figurative muddle, just "fragile yet endless journey" charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carver + butterfly migration reframes collective grief through tangible craft. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—ribbon’s generational wear and poem knots feel inevitable, not quirky.</comment>
