<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("preemptively nostalgic") manifests in embodied micro-choices like kneeling to hear crystal whispers while already mourning the moment. Final endurance as Earned Stasis earns closure with visible cost in "continued his work" amid fading light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "memories dripping like rain" to Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "ensuring memories... would never truly be lost" amid dissipating storm—conceptual price of eternal vigilance crystallized when "last light faded."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Solidified fog and crystal forecourt constrain choices (kneeling to hear whispers) and charge the final image where words "amplified... carried into solidified fog." Recurring crystals evolve from sound-absorbers to living archive, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around dominant stake (memory preservation) via deepening: shadow examination shifts from historical reconstruction to identity sculpting. Agency peaks when quill "resonating with the task" reweights options, with felt cost in "continued his work" as light fades.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal whispers and shadow sequences, not abstraction. Final image—"archivist continued his work" amid "deepening hush"—resonantly answers "what we can become" by showing preservation as active endurance, not tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("memories dripping like rain," "fog draped in mystery") filters all observation. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure: short clauses during shadow examination ("Each length...") contrast lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances texture (e.g., "crystal formations... absorbing sounds" compresses worldbuilding). Figurative language ("stormlit heavens") remains concrete and pressure-motivated, avoiding muddle even in high-stakes closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms memory-archivist trope through solidified fog physics and "preemptive nostalgia" specificity. Emotional truth in Elthion’s ache for moments before they pass avoids generic templates, with "living archive" concept synthesizing fresh stakes from prior particulars.</comment>
