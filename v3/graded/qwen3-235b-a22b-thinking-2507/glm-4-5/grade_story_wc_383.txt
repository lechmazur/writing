<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between skepticism and belief remains stated rather than embodied in micro-choices; "tragic radiance" leans toward label over specific contradiction during memory surfacing at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: no clear "who/where/when" until paragraph 2 (~150 words), triggering -0.4 penalty; closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight and wisdom of quarantined memories") but anchor debt caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crystals/shell) constrains choices and charges final image, but Orientation penalty applied in Q2 caps Q3 at 7.0; velvet garden remains atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics during memory archiving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory density (crystal pulses, shell warmth) but escalation lacks protagonist agency; pressure accumulates texturally toward conceptual cost ("burden of containing what others could not bear"), meeting Accumulative/Textural escalation standards for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through particulars ("isolation transformed into independence" shown via resonance structures), but Orientation debt caps category at 8.3; final image reweights premise without moralizing, though "ghostly resolve" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet garden," "sorrow of forgotten civilizations") shines, but Orientation debt caps Q6 at 7.8; filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") dull immediacy during high-pressure memory surfacing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("charmed skepticism"/"charmed skeptic," "ghostly resolve" repetition) and elevated diction ("tragically radiant") in peak beats trigger -0.3 penalty; no closure-dulling artifacts but density falters during reflection blocks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archiving metaphor through resonance structures, but "whispering shell" trope lacks transformation; Orientation debt caps category at 8.3 despite strong emotional specificity in closure.</comment>
