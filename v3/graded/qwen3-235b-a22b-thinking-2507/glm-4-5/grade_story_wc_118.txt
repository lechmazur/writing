<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction absent; "sensitively perceptive" trait stated repeatedly without embodied trade-offs or struggle. No moment where this gift backfires under pressure, rendering the historian's choices frictionless and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: historian's smile crystallizes acceptance of their role with conceptual cost (permanent dream-loss). But escalation lacks meaningful pressure—discoveries accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes, violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo library functions as micro-setting: "bronze quiet" and "metal bones" constrain choices (fragile diaries demand careful handling) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—historian's narrowed perception during diary examination embodies crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving stories) remains abstract; no on-page cost or narrowed options. Historian faces zero opposition—silo cooperates, discoveries emerge effortlessly. Pressure never tightens beyond sequential revelations, failing the lens requirement for coherent escalation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through evolving dragon motif (decoration→cosmic force) and "bronze quiet" reweighted as both burden and vessel. Final image offers non-literal answer to "what survives dreams?" but stakes remain intellectualized without visceral human cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive" filtering details) shines, but filter verbs ("allowed them to detect") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Rhythm control weakens during tapestry examination with repetitive syntactic cadence ("With careful hands... tracing...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in key beats: "fragile as moth wings," "reality to thin at the edges," and "bronze quality" cluster in the diary discovery scene, diluting emotional impact. Figurative density crosses into muddle without pattern-teaching, violating peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via "bronze quiet" and silo-as-library, but emotional stakes feel safe. Lacks bold risk—historian's work faces no tangible threat, and "axis displacement" remains abstract. Fresh details (hearth diaries) don't challenge the premise's comfort.</comment>
