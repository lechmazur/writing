<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "featherly determination" is stated but not tested through meaningful trade-offs with visible cost. Final reunion feels unearned by prior causality despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words (unclear where/when) triggers -0.4 penalty. Closure as Charged Poise ("sacred thresholds... return to love") lands with emotional cost, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) weakens escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace and logbook constrain choices effectively, with wood grain analysis charging the final image. Sensory details ("hairs stand at attention," "water-thick air") reflect urgency but drift toward ornamental abstraction in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's threshold analysis, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options. The "Home" revelation feels coincidental rather than earned by agency under Accumulative lens, muting cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "necessary distances" as sacred geometry, with final image reweighting separation/balance without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality but secondary stake (father's grief) remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice has distinct textural rhythm ("featherly determination," "fractured hush") that modulates with pressure, but filter-verb clusters ("she suspected," "she recognized") dull immediacy in high-stakes threshold approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("movements as light as dust... yet as determined as rivers") triggers -0.6 penalty. Synonym churn ("fractured hush deepened... air thickening") and mixed metaphors obscure causal pressure at closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Transforms corn maze tropes through prism thresholds and logbook codes, but "butterfly effect" framing feels derivative. Emotional truth in father-daughter reunion is undercut by underdeveloped world logic.</comment>
