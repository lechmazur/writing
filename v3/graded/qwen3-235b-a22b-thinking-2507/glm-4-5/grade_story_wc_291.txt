<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in face-blindness drives tactile investigation, but "awaken dormant empathy" motivation lacks contradictory impulses in peak pressure; confession resolution feels tidier than character struggle warrants.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("justice dormant... empathy waits"), but Reyes' timely document delivery weakens causal escalation; lens holds as Hybrid (causal dominant at resolution).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quarry mist functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and charges final image ("furrowed hush lifting"); ribbon fragment's physical properties directly enable the breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving for community empathy) tightens credibly when ribbon links to custom masks, but Reyes' off-page evidence retrieval reduces protagonist agency in escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "dormant justice/awakened empathy" CR; final line reweights quarry's isolation with conceptual cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (textures over faces) creates distinct voice, but "furrowed hush" repetition and lyrical cadence occasionally override character-specific stress response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("gold-and-silver threading catching dim light") offsets minor scaffold in "methodical" repetitions; no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind investigator and quarry setting elevates cold case trope, though "unifying opposites" remains underdeveloped conceptually.</comment>
