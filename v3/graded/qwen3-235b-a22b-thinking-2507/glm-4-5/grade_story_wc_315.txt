<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses in crisis; "trust rested on shoulders" feels abstract rather than embodied. Muscle memory actions show character-specific struggle but epiphanies remain undramatized ("making the unbelievable seem inevitable"). Flaws complicate choices credibly yet final transmission lacks visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via transmission with conceptual cost ("clarity that belied complexity"), but lens ambiguity weakens escalation. The atmospheric anomaly escalation feels accumulative yet the emergency protocol’s origin remains causally opaque. Cost proof is legible in the final line’s tension between clarity and burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor functions as micro-setting: rustling leaves without wind constrain choice by signaling danger, while parachute buckle charges the final image as "anchor." Sensory details (moonlight on buckle, soundless echo) reflect urgency without checklist repetition. Environment directly pressures tactics through isolation and thin atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through atmospheric sensor anomalies contradicting patterns, narrowing options to communication or evacuation. "Preserve trust" motivation drives agency in arranging evidence and transmission, with cost legible in the transmitted message determining "everyone’s fate." Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: parachute buckle’s evolution from equipment to "tool for revision" reweights survival mathematics. Final transmission offers resonant answer via "clarity that belied complexity," avoiding moralizing. Avoids false equivalence by framing truth-preservation as non-negotiable burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice shows distinct perceptual signature ("stars seemed to whisper warnings") but repetitive syntax ("Remembering through muscle memory...") dulls pressure. Purposeful compression works for accumulative lens yet "attentively inventive" labels dilute interiority. Tense/stability holds but stress-induced diction compression feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose suffers from scaffold loops: "Remembering through muscle memory" appears verbatim twice within 10 lines, violating paragraph cut test. Strong verbs ("sketched," "tightened") offset generic phrases ("attentively inventive"), but synonym churn ("reconfigure," "repricing") in high-pressure beats muddles clarity near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of atmospheric vigilance with poetic duty avoids genre clichés through specific stakes ("hanging gardens," "survival mathematics"). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens coherence yet "Great Storm" backstory feels template-like. Emotional truth anchors universals in parachute buckle’s tangible weight.</comment>
