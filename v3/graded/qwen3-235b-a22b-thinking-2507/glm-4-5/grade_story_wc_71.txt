<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; flawlessly rendered motivation undercut by unearned smoothness in the climax where realization arrives without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("echo of lives poured into walls"), but Accumulative lens falters as object glow feels coincidental rather than earned density escalation—pressure lacks tangible narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the lighthouse cottage’s "pulse with memory" constrains Aria’s final placement choice and charges the glowing revelation, transforming orris shard from object to emotional conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding house aliveness) tightens through object placements, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the cottage climax resolves through mystical glow rather than Aria’s active choices under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: displaced objects as "echoes of attachment" crystallizes in the final image without moralizing, reweighting "emptiness" as profound presence through concrete resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—"houses breathed with life while others merely occupied space" establishes Aria’s unique noticing lens; rhythmic control deepens under climax pressure with no register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" and "inadvertently profound" verge on thematic echo in peak beats; minor density issues in climax ("vibration of something profound being revealed") slightly obscure causal immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "collector" trope through orris shard’s sonic stillness; emotional specificity ("hum of connection between place and person") avoids abstraction while risking poetic abstraction that pays off in closure.</comment>
