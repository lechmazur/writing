<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "devotedly observant" trait stated but not shown creating tradeoffs (e.g., noticing financial details while missing emotional cues). Final choice lacks embodied cost despite conceptual resolution. Motivation clear but micro-choices lack tension under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: dawn realization reconfigures "orbits of regret" into "orbits of justice" with conceptual cost (father's legacy). Orientation solid within 100 words. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase in evidence examination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains choice: curved walls echo thoughts, celestial maps inform investigation. Rosewood pen charges final image ("symbol of commitment"). Sensory details (clouds, pen nib texture) evolve with emotional state without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (clearing Davies), pressure tightens through evidence deepening. But "proof by contradiction" method isn't dramatized as active tool—assumed then abandoned until climax. Cost felt conceptually but lacks tangible tradeoff (e.g., time, emotional toll).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "orbits" motif reweighting, but final line ("showing people what they've refused to see") states thesis overtly. Emotional honesty in Eleanor's determination undermined by thematic echo in closing moral, reducing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: journalist's "urgent words" filtered through observatory acoustics, financial records "danced" by practiced fingers. Voice modulates from solemn ("orbits of regret") to playful ("delightful puzzle") without convergence. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop: "devotedly observant eyes... devotedly observant mind" (adjacent sentences) triggers -0.2. Overwritten phrases ("playful solemnity," "orbits of determination") slightly blur pressure. Final image ("write the truth that would change everything") lacks specificity for 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of investigative journalism and mathematical logic ("proof by contradiction") avoids genre clichés. Emotional specificity in Eleanor's legacy-driven motivation elevates familiar corruption plot. Risk in Accumulative structure pays off through observatory's sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
