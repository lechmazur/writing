<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s internal conflict (duty vs. desire) lacks contradictory impulses in peak stress; his flawless execution of the blueprint diminishes struggle. "Graceless beauty" gestures show embodied emotion, but epiphany about his burden feels unearned without prior doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with cost—spent nut, expended energy—but mechanical birds’ non-interference violates causality; coincidence resolves threat instead of pressure. Frost forming crystallizes stakes, yet bird passivity undermines escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard’s curse and nut constrain choices (power source), while labyrinth walls charge the final image. Sensory details like "glittering crystals" on stone narrow perception under urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Night frost deadline tightens options meaningfully, but travelers function as abstract stakes—not dramatized individuals. Mechanical birds complicate without raising cost, failing to pressure Elias’s tactics; their irrelevance dilutes escalation under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "curse to blessing" reconfiguration via the nut’s dimming, avoiding moralizing. Yet "reluctant caretaker" realization lacks complexity; "burden not such a burden" oversimplifies the orchard’s moral ambiguity into near-symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "offhandedly exact" measurements and thorn navigation. Voice modulates effectively under stress, though "graceless beauty" repetition risks thematic echo. No head-hopping; POV consistency anchors the tense rescue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with purposeful rhythm ("twilight painted the sky"), but "graceless beauty" recurs as scaffold loop. Near-closure line "source of power that could be wielded with graceless beauty" restates prior imagery, dulling momentum by 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed orchard" trope through Elias’s tactile precision and the nut’s reconfiguration. Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens (frost as pressure) feels inevitable, though blueprint’s sudden discovery lacks freshness in setup.</comment>
