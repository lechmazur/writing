<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("half truths" philosophy) and embodied emotion (static electricity sensing) feel authentic; final reflection on "paradox" earns endurance with visible cost in locked cabinet and detached satisfaction. No therapy-speak or over-tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "knowledge that sometimes profound truths could be found in carefully crafted half truths" reconfigures the premise. Accumulative lens holds, but transformation mechanics slightly abstract; static electricity sensing provides tangible pressure for one tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto actively constrains choices—Elias "chose this location" for emotional resonance, and the light directly enables the counterfeit emotions' authenticity. Final image of locking cabinet in amber hues charges closure with conceptual cost of controlled access to emotions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticity of counterfeit emotions) tightens through subsuming client's state; Elias's agency drives one deepening ("paradox of his profession"). Cost is felt in locked cabinet and "affectionate detachment," though escalation could be more visceral under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (blotter petals, static sensing), not abstraction. Final line reweights "half truths" with undeniable conceptual cost—locked emotions symbolize necessary but dangerous access—avoiding moralizing while inviting reflection on authenticity's paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static electricity," "blotter petals") and rhythmic control ("strange alchemy of science and intuition") reflect Elias's mind. Voice modulates from clinical ("cataloging meticulously") to reflective ("affectionate detachment") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fragrance chemist's blotter petals, each holding emotional signature" does triple duty). Rhythm accelerates during transformation ("fingers tingling"), breathes in reflection. Final line recharges motif without muddle—"carefully crafted half truths" crystallizes conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "emotion dealer" trope through specific mechanics (static sensing, amber grotto resonance). Fresh inflection: counterfeit emotions "unlock what's already there," avoiding cliché. Bold risk in premise heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
