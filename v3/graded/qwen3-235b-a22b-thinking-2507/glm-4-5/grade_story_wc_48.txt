<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("human resilience," "profound motivation") rather than embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost beyond internal resolution, weakening Earned Stasis. Diagnostic phrasing like "indelible, permanent impressions" triggers -0.5 range deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: no clear who/where/when by 120 words (e.g., "feral nexus" undefined), uncapped per waiver rules. Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks tangible cost—peace feels unearned as prior doubt dissolves without sacrifice. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) persists past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mist setting creates atmosphere but fails micro-setting test: it doesn't constrain choices (e.g., no tactical impact on writing process). Recurring seashell charges the final image but enters too late (para 3) to shape prior beats. Sensory details stay generic ("crumbling stone ruins").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic integrity vs. commercial pressure) remains abstract—never tested concretely in-scene. "Against the current" concept is echoed thematically but doesn't narrow options (e.g., no moment where mist physically impedes writing). Escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; cost feels conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thematic Echo penalty (-0.7) for final-line moralizing ("smallest things can contain entire universes"). Theme emerges from abstraction ("human resilience") not concrete particulars; "ephemeral cameo appearances" motif is forced, not organically integrated into character choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lucidly watchful," mathematical framing) shines early but degrades under pressure—repetitive cadence ("Through ephemeral cameo appearances...") flattens voice. No head-hopping, but rhythm lacks variation in climax beats where compression should heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Severe loop penalty (-0.9): "lucidly watchful" (3x), "ephemeral cameo appearances" (3x), and "swirling hush" (3x) create template cadence. Filter-verb stacks ("he had come to understand," "he had struggled") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final image obscured by figurative muddle ("entire universes of meaning").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Derivative Premise Guardrail (-0.8): "struggling artist vs. commercialism" trope lacks fresh inflection beyond lyrical dressing. Emotional truth diluted by abstraction; specificity (seashell geometry) feels ornamental, not transformative. Avoids safety middle but risks feel decorative, not coherent.</comment>
