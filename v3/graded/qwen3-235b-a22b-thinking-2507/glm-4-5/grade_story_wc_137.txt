<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism-to-connection arc lacks sufficient contradictory impulses; her "courageously kind" shift feels unearned without visible cost (e.g., no resistance from visitors or personal sacrifice). Interiority stays concrete but emotional progression resolves too tidily, missing the messy irrationality required for 8.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves valid Charged Poise ("Elara understood her role as both keeper and participant...") with conceptual cost in lifelong stewardship. Orientation anchors by word 5 ("Elara stood at the edge..."), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through tile transcriptions building to crystallized final image. Minor flaw: decision to invite others lacks on-page causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower functions as essential micro-setting: its openness enables sanctuary transformation, acoustics channel whale songs to interact with the tile, and final image ("The tower remained open...") charges closure. Sensory details are purposefully selective (tile's "warmth," "resonant harmonies") and filtered through Elara's scientific-poetic bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (connection vs. isolation) accumulate under Accumulative lens but lack protagonist-driven escalation; inviting visitors faces no resistance, and no tangible cost emerges (e.g., lost solitude or effort). Band guardrail fails: trade-off isn't shown, and final image lacks charged price despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through transcribed patterns and shifting whale/tile imagery—no thematic echo. Final image ("resonating with the unheard symphony...") delivers non-literal answer to connection's nature while embracing complexity (skepticism as incomplete, not wrong). Perfect fulfillment of 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("unheard symphony," "entangled memories") and rhythmic control shine: scientific precision tightens during transcriptions, lyrical flow swells at closure. Zero head-hopping; experimental accumulation taught early and paid off in Charged Poise. Meets 9+ quick test with room to spare.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but adjacent paraphrase loop ("Through forgotten patterns she recognized..."/"Through forgotten patterns she documented...") triggers -0.2. Final image avoids overwriting, yet "courageously kind" tells rather than shows. Prevents 9.0+ but strong for band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific mechanics: tile transcription as active ritual, whale migration as integral to memory-conduit function. Emotional truth anchors the fantastical—Elara's journey mirrors real connection struggles. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, meeting 9+ quick test with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
