<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Protagonist lacks concrete interiority or embodied emotion; motivation stated as abstract imperative ("to share light without fire") without contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. No discernible flaws or sensory specificity to ground the cosmic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (eternal cycle of sharing light), but causal links dissolve into lyric repetition; "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" loop obscures pressure escalation toward the transit climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nebula garden remains postcard backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes choices (e.g., transit mechanics ignore spatial logic). "Falling petals" motif repeats verbatim without evolving pressure or charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) lacks escalation; civilization's fear of fire is stated but never tested through concrete action. Sonar pinging intensifies without narrowing options or altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "light without fire" and generational patterns, but final image ("troubling serenity") states rather than embodies the cost. Avoids moralizing but lacks the resonant non-literal answer required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Distinct cosmic lexicon ("stardust," "cosmic winds") creates voice, but perceptual signature blurs under pressure; repeated "troubling serenity" and "quiet sigh" phrases flatten rhythmic control during transit climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("across the quiet sigh of falling petals" x4 verbatim) and template cadence ("The... began to...") dull propulsion; "approximating infinity" becomes stock abstraction without concrete payoff in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic sentimentalist and generational patterns avoids cliché, but "calculating machine gear" feels derivative of Clarkean monolith tropes; emotional specificity in light-sharing mission elevates beyond mere conceptual exercise.</comment>
