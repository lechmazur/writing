<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (foolish facade vs. cosmic insight) drives micro-choices like feigned confusion when officials share secrets. Embodied emotion in "fingers flying" during crisis avoids therapy-speak. Final endurance (continuing to embroider) earns Earned Stasis with visible cost of perpetual deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: conspiracy unravels thread by thread while Elara maintains her persona, with cost legible in "the eternal candle's flame steady and certain" amid replaced whispers. Accumulative lens holds through pattern-density escalation; no causality breaks despite compressed timeline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The embroidery needle functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (decoding via threads) and charges the final image ("pick up her needle and listen"). Sensory details like "crimson leaves drifted past the domed ceiling" reflect urgency without tourist cataloging, with autumn wind affecting action during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: her pattern-decoding narrows options to "calculated delays" as the only path to foil the coup. Cost is visceral in maintaining her "foolish" persona under pressure, with "mysterious engine trouble" and "thrown shoe" representing tangible tradeoffs that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "listening with hands" reweights "foolishness" as resistance without moralizing. Final image ("listen for unheard stories") resonates as non-literal answer to "unheard stories woven into cosmos," avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity (conspirators' wrongness unstated).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters cosmos through embroidery ("threads a tale, each knot a hidden language"). Rhythmic control accelerates during crisis ("fingers flying") while maintaining voice coherence. Condescension in official's dialogue reveals status dynamics without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("prismatic tears" compresses light/weather/emotion). Strategic telling compresses transit ("by morning, her work was complete"). Final line's "infinite tapestry" recharges "star-flecked fabric" without figurative muddle, though "adjacent possibilities" slightly strains lexicon in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise fool" trope through embroidery-specific logic; emotional truth in quiet resistance avoids safety middle. "Adjacent possibilities" synthesizes cosmic/conspiracy stakes uniquely. Risk-taking (craft as intelligence tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with freshness verified by removal test—change premise collapses causality.</comment>
