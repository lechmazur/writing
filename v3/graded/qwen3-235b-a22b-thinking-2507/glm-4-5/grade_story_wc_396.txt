<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("map empathy onto action") drives choices, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during reconstitution; micro-choices under pressure are present but insufficiently layered with self-deception or irrationality to reach 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (breath caught, elders' skepticism answered), but cost legibility falters slightly—the "weighted breath" motif isn't embodied viscerally enough in the final beat to fully satisfy the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: ice floes' groaning syncs with magic rhythm, apple trees shudder during reconstitution, and the crystal shard's physicality (biting palm) charges the final image—environment functions as micro-setting with undeniable causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (Accumulative lens), narrowing options via the "weighted breath" deadline, but the cost—while felt—lacks concrete physical or relational forfeiture; Elena's triumph feels slightly unearned without visible toll on her capabilities.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal reconstitution as empathy-in-action, but final paragraph's thematic echo ("courageously anomalous act... navigate with understanding") edges toward moralizing, diluting the earned resonance of the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("shadows deepened, wrapping her in comforting embrace") with rhythmic control during high-pressure beats, though minor psychic distance slips occur when describing Elena's abilities abstractly ("intuitive abilities often preceding logical conclusions").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold, but adjacent lines ("fingers tracing patterns... most could not see" / "ice floes below groaned") create a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum in a pivotal beat; otherwise, propulsion and specificity excel.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of vintage mirrors and shadow magic feels inevitable, with risk-taking (non-causal Accumulative structure) heightening stakes, though "shadow-laced peacekeeper" risks trope familiarity without deeper transformation of the archetype.</comment>
