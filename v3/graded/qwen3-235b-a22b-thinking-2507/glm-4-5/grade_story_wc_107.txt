<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (abandoning past yet transforming it) but "thawing heart" metaphor edges toward thematic echo; micro-choices under pressure like selecting copper for the base reveal values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("Thus, we thaw") crystallizes options with felt cost via melting ice and abandoned grief, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) isn't named until midpoint, blocking 8.8+ eligibility per high-band gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned control room functions as micro-setting: corroded metal guides drip rhythm, electrical panel copper becomes base material, constraining choices and charging the final light patterns with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through ice melting's cadence shift (metronome to surrender), narrowing options to transformation; cost is visible in abandoned grief layers, though "thawing heart" concept slightly over-explains stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from glass terrariums and melting ice as "safe zones for inquiry," but mid-story line "this is how we melt what has grown too solid within" triggers -0.4 thematic echo penalty for prompt-like articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: molten glass descriptions use compressed syntax ("glow like captured sunlight"), while closure shifts to sparse dialogue; no head-hopping despite theatrical narration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, but "thoughtfully spirited" repeats 4x with synonym churn (-0.3); high-density prose ("dripped rhythmically against corroded metal, becoming both metronome and accompaniment") drives momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Transforms "abandonment" trope through glassblowing physics and control room salvage; fresh inflection in using inquiry terrariums as emotional metaphor, though "thawing heart" leans familiar without sufficient risk.</comment>
