<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "mournfully eager" manifests physically through throttle modulation, but overuse of the phrase risks becoming diagnostic label-speak; final choice to stop the blower earns endurance with felt cost in "phantom carried on off-key wind."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively when the giggle shifts silence from "oppressive" to "echo released," with cost crystallized in "he'd merely remembered how it sounded"; Accumulative lens holds through sound-layering escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stone tunnel actively constrains choices (modulating throttle for echo effects) and charges final image ("ghost of laughter lingering"); pull cord handle functions as micro-setting that evolves from "slick anchor" to "cool and still" in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's escalating sound-weaving, culminating in the giggle's arrival; cost is unmistakable in the renunciation of restoration ("hadn't restored laughter") with visible emotional shift in "ache... momentarily soothed."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "absence itself could be a sanctuary" crystallizes in the final image without moralizing; the leaf blower's transformation from tool to memory conduit reweights grief as active remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("macerating oppressive quiet," "distorted, breathy hum") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in throttle modulation sequences teaches the accumulative pattern early, paying off in the giggle's return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synonym churn in "mournfully eager" repetitions (-0.3) and thematic echo in "tending to the unspoken" (-0.2) trigger Non-closure Accumulation Cap; no artifacts dull closure's "ghost of laughter" resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leaf-blower symphony transforms grief tropes through specific acoustic mechanics; "true haunting" redefinition feels inevitable when the giggle emerges from Silas's own warped lullabies, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
