<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "cautiously hopeful" lacks embodied trade-offs; emotional progression too tidy without sufficient contradictory impulses during climax. Diagnostic label "obsession" appears without showing degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly with clear orientation (<120 words) and decisive change (signal stops). Cost legible in "cosmic tricksters might return" but conceptual price needs sharper sensory anchoring at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: radio station equipment and trembling charts actively constrain choices. Antenna becomes "invisible fingers" charging climax; final image ties university setting to new human "power plays" with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stop manipulation) escalates via transmitter activation, but cost remains abstract. "Cosmic significance and earthly terror" tells rather than shows visceral consequence; needs one sensory detail of physical toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "power plays" evolving from cosmic to human conflict. Final line avoids moralizing but slightly overstates "cosmic game"; would resonate more trusting the Merrick interaction alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hears whispers between signals," static-prickled skin) modulates perfectly under pressure. No POV slippage; rhythm shifts from measured analysis to staccato tension during transmission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minor artifacts: "astronomical charts began to tremble" anthropomorphizes without physical cause; "cosmic significance" uses abstract nouns where sensory detail would strengthen climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms alien trope through subsonic specificity and academic stakes. Fresh inflection in cosmic alignments matching broadcast initiation; avoids safety-middle by making victory temporary with new human conflicts.</comment>
