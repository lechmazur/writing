<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("burned bridges carefully" vs duty's call) manifests physically in clutching the ring; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak even during peak stress when scars "ached with resonance." Final choice earned through micro-choices like tracing carvings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "leaving behind the ashen comfort... delivered only loneliness" crystallizes abandonment of constructed world. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (ring's warmth → threshold shimmer) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Ashen sanctuary constrains every choice (sweeping ritual maintains threshold) and charges final image: "carried its essence within her now." Recurring charcoal dust evolves from memory medium to symbol of internalized refuge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: ring's "throbbing" narrows options to binary choice. Visible cost in abandoned sanctuary reweights solitude's promise ("peace but delivered loneliness") under consistent lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "linking through scars" shown via hand-touching climax, not stated. Final dawn image answers "can isolation heal?" without moralizing, reweighting "loaded emptiness" as possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("breath formed mist," "cold as forgotten promises") remains consistent under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from measured sweeps to staccato knocks, teaching pattern early with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("burned bridges carefully" compresses backstory efficiently). Figurative language ("threshold shimmered like heat lightning") enhances clarity without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms threshold guardian trope through specific logic: scars as connective tissue, ash as memory medium. Risk-taking in quiet climax (no dialogue resolution) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
