<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied micro-choices (tracing pendant while documenting spiral), though "protected vulnerability" risks therapy-speak. Final renunciation of the pendant earns the arc with visible cost when she releases the confession's hold on her spirit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the moss-enveloped pendant reweights truth-telling's cost. Accumulative lens holds through pattern density (icicle spiral → grief stages), though the "months later" coda slightly dilutes immediacy of the on-page release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Server racks surrendering to moss actively constrain choice (glass under feet creaking) and charge the final image. Every detail—from keyboard fragments to circuit boards—serves the theme of transformation without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening perception: the icicle pattern shifts from observation to reconciliation method, narrowing options toward the proffer. Cost is unmistakable when she feels the viral confession "release its hold on her spirit."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars (moss nourishing corrosion), avoiding moralizing. Final image—"wounds become part of the landscape"—resonates as a non-literal answer to ethical healing without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mathematical beauty emerging from chaos") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor deduction for "proffered" (slightly stiff lexicon), but compression of time through patterned elision remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence multi-tasks ("vines wove through circuit boards... reverent" establishes setting/theme/perception). Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete emerald moss imagery. Only microscopic flaw: "reverent" borders anthropomorphism but fits voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms redemption clichés via tech-moss hybridity. Fresh inflection in using icicle spirals as grief methodology. Emotional specificity in "server racks surrendering" avoids generic templates while honoring scientific context.</comment>
