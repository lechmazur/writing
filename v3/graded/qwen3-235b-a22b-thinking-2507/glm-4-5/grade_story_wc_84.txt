<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (sharp-eyed precision vs. perpetual surprise) drives micro-choices under pressure, but "perpetually surprised" trait remains observational rather than altering tactics—e.g., surprise at alert triggers jump but no consequential error or adaptation, limiting embodied conflict depth at pivotal convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visceral cost ("racing heart," "reaching across light-years"), causal lens holds throughout via drone-path calculations narrowing options, but pilgrim’s off-page role creates minor causality drift—resolution hinges on Maya’s agency alone despite initial warning dependency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ancient observatory actively constrains choices (dusk launch timing, copper dome navigation) and charges final image with "brilliant dimness" expansion; drone and matrix chip function as micro-settings that evolve causally, though liquid night descriptor edges toward lyrical vagueness without tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Maya’s agency—star trail sequencing tightens options toward convergence point—with felt cost crystallized in her racing heart and existential certainty; "missing connection" deepens stakes organically, but pilgrim’s abstract warnings lack concrete on-page threat escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars (star trails as belonging, missing pieces as self-integration), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "frequency of belonging" as internal resonance, though pilgrim’s explicit "belonging wasn’t found" line risks thematic echo without sufficient subtextual buffering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in data-stream descriptions ("shifting like living things"), rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with shortening syntax at climax; consistent focalization avoids POV leaks, but "perpetually surprised" repetition slightly flattens emotional specificity during high-stakes maneuvers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold—e.g., "brilliant dimness" motif taught early and paid off—but "pure recognition, a sensation that filled Maya" edges toward abstract labeling in peak beat, slightly dulling closure’s physical immediacy despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech and cosmic mysticism transforms tropes via concrete stakes (frequency decoding), with emotional truth in Maya’s self-recognition; avoids derivative safety through specific verifiable details (type foundry chip, seven-constellation convergence), though pilgrim archetype lacks full originality.</comment>
