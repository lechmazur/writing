<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines ("skeletal hands tracing tentacle"), but "Solitude" naming risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient physical cost demonstration in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("cloak no longer heavy"), yet "echo of sacrifice" remains thematic ornament rather than causal pressure shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory’s cracked glass actively generates "scattered light" mechanics that constrain the naming ritual, charging the final transformation of sea monsters into "something almost beautiful."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through naming sequence, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; "scattered light" functions as convenient coincidence rather than earned intensification under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through atlas-to-stars transformation, avoiding moralizing; final line’s "healing in sacrifice" resonates without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice ("voice like dry leaves") with poetic compression, but repetitive "scattered light" phrasing creates subtle cadence loops in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lean prose overall, yet adjacent sentences restate light’s effect ("crystallized," "defined now") creating paraphrase loops that dilute the closure beat’s density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper trope via naming mechanic, though "echo of sacrifice" leans on familiar conceptual framing without sufficient transformation.</comment>
