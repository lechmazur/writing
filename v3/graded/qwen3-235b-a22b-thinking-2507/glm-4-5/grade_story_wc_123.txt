<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows professional contradiction (meticulous recorder vs. curiosity-driven risk), but "nurture integrity in solitude" refrain borders on label-speak without deepening embodied conflict during the pivotal tube-opening moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly; pigeon discovery creates irreversible knowledge shift. Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (pigeon’s return journey = hope/risk), though the courtyard’s transformation from refuge to launchpad slightly over-explains the stakes shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as micro-setting: fountain masks sounds during tube examination, dusk shadows enable lateral movement. Final stars charging the pigeon release qualifies for 9+ gate, but courtyard’s physical constraints don’t actively reshape tactics beyond basic cover.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s lateral investigation method, with the pigeon tube’s discovery forcing the binary choice: silence or rebellion. Cost is legible in the "burdened not by physical mass" line, though the authorities’ immediate threat remains atmospheric rather than tactile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by letting the silver-feathered pigeon embody the theme—deception repurposed as liberation. Final image reweights "layered tranquility" into earned promise, but "nurture integrity in solitude" risks thematic echo by mid-story repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("recorder’s eye for detail," weather-obsessed diction), with rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. Slight register drift when "credibly curious" appears as near-identical phrasing in two critical moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops in climax; "burdened not by physical mass" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor deduction for three repetitions of "nurture integrity in solitude" creating paraphrase loops that dilute momentum in middle beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine tropes via meteorological lens; pigeon-as-weapon is fresh synthesis. "Progressing laterally" elevates standard investigation tropes, though "rogue quarantine zone" lacks specific world logic to feel indispensable beyond backdrop.</comment>
