<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Thomas’s complicity vs. duty; embodied micro-choices (label handling, journal search) reveal values under pressure. Slight reflective summary in cabin scene risks BRR limits but pivots to action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "unwittingly upheld" realization crystallizes stakes. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric pressure. Cost legible in final image’s "reclaimed truth" reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reservoir’s micro-setting constrains choices (treading carefully, label discovery) and charges closure; "sapphire-hued" specificity embodies memory. Ridgeway’s exposure directly enables the climax. Final image’s rooftops reconfigure prior stillness with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. official narrative) tightens via label discovery into irreversible action. Agency-driven escalation culminates in "expunge" choice with visible cost to Thomas’s identity. Conceptual price shapes tactics: his calls reconfigure options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment>Theme emerges through particulars (liqueur label, photos) without moralizing; "reclaimed truth" finale reweights "water and memory" non-literally. Avoids false balance but secondary stake (personal legacy) lacks sufficient tension with dominant truth-seeking arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("weathered hands," "miraculously preserved") modulates under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure. Final paragraph’s rhythmic shift to active resolve avoids overwriting. Near-flawless but "spinning silence into meaning" slightly echoes earlier phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "muted shades of violet" exemplifies textural propulsion. One paraphrase loop ("receding/reservoir" in opening) and "spinning silence" repetition prevent 8.5+. Final line’s "reclaimed truth" skirts abstraction but redeemed by concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "lost town" trope through bureaucratic complicity and insider perspective; liqueur label as truth-key feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in Thomas’s aunt revelation elevates, but premise lacks radical novelty for 9.0+.</comment>
