<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; spiritual purity remains abstract without embodied struggle against conformity. Final choice lacks visible cost—untangling threads feels effortless despite seven generations' failure, undermining earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise stepping through) lands conceptually but lacks concrete cost proof. "Harvest of echoes" remains thematic rather than viscerally sacrificed; no specific image shows what Elara forfeits to unlock the sanctuary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Snow and threads create vivid atmosphere but don't constrain choices—e.g., cold never impedes movement, threads lack physical resistance. Micro-setting potential (body as constraint) is stated ("bodily poetic") but never embodied in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying conformity) is clear but pressure never escalates—same "untangling" action repeats without narrowing options. Cost remains abstract ("preservation of essence") rather than viscerally felt through concrete loss or tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through "harvest of echoes" as collective rebellion; avoids moralizing. Final image ("unlocked the rhythm of her own heart") reweights chastity as spiritual sovereignty without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice ("silver lullaby," "diamante witnesses") with consistent perceptual bias toward threads and echoes. Minor overwriting in high-pressure moments dilutes immediacy (e.g., "alarming serenity settled like a second skin").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Template cadence cripples momentum: "Between sigh and smile" repeats 4x with identical function. Synonym churn ("rebellion," "defied," "bending conformity") creates conceptual redundancy without advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Chaste courtesan" trope transformed into spiritual preservation angle feels fresh, but prism sanctuary relies on derivative magical-realm conventions. Lacks one bold risk (e.g., making conformity momentarily compelling).</comment>
