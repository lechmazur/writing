<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. scientific rigor) act in scene through embodied choices like trembling fingers pressing the nail. Final activation choice is earned by prior decoding work with visible cost: overwhelming responsibility crystallized in "question decades of meteorological consensus". No diagnostic labels; dread is concrete ("spongey" as tactile librarian's perception).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: blue light awakening systems reconfigures options with undeniable cost ("overwhelming responsibility"). Causal lens holds (journal decoding → diagram → activation) with persistent constraint (copper nail indentation). Minor flaw: reversible tech reveal lacks middle beat showing calculation verification, slightly softening escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Copper nail functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must press specific indentation) and charges final image ("still warm against their skin"). Sensory details like "damp chill permeating concrete walls" mirror internal state through action. "Spongey dread" edges toward cliché but remains character-particular via librarian's tactile vocabulary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through "dread shifted from apprehension... to overwhelming responsibility" as pressure tightens toward activation choice. Agency-driven escalation (Eli decodes → discovers diagram → presses nail) narrows options decisively. Lacks visible price paid *before* climax (e.g., no sacrificed resource), slightly diluting cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "reversible exile" literalized via technology and metaphor. Final image ("blue light across panels") reweights exile as solvable without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo despite "blueprint for restoration" phrasing by embedding concept in action (Eli initiating sequence). No tidy resolution; cost is conceptual (institutional upheaval).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: librarian's archival focus ("water-damaged pages," "shipwrecked journals") blends with scientific precision ("zooming in on diagram"). Rhythm modulates from measured exposition to urgent cadence at climax ("fingers trembled... pressed"). Minor flaw: "nervously confident" is label rather than embodied state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("The panel responded with a soft chime, revealing hidden controls"). "Spongey dread" risks mixed metaphor but remains character-coherent. Final image ("copper nail still warm") charges closure with tactile specificity. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: poetic stanzas as scientific blueprint transforms climate fiction tropes. Emotional truth in "nervous confidence" (not heroic certainty) and generational trauma via copper nail. Specificity anchors universals: "temperate coastline now battled unpredictable storms" avoids generic apocalypse. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
