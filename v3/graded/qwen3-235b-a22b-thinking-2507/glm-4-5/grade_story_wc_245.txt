<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in grief/acceptance duality, but "navigate uncharted emotional depths" risks diagnostic label-speak. Final choice earned through embodied memory surges during the musical trail walk, not abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes perfectly: kneeling at stillpoint with tears reconfigures blindness as perception. Cost is visceral (tears) and conceptual (identity shift), with Accumulative/Textural lens holding through sensory density escalation to silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices via musical trail navigation. Compass ring's physicality charges the climax—pressing it to earth transforms tool into emotional conduit, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through textural density—musical notes intensifying to silence—reweights Elion's emotional stakes. Cost is legible in tears and abandoned mapmaker identity, though forest pressure occasionally leans symbolic rather than constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "quiet blaze" motif recharging from sensory description to soul-illumination. Final image avoids moralizing while reweighting blindness as perception, resisting tidy resolution with "universe within" conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—vibrations as "braille written by the forest" reflects Elion's tactile POV. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in shortening phrases during memory surges, though "heirloom" redundancy slightly disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "quiet blaze" motif evolves without overwriting. Final line ("quiet blaze kindled within his soul") recharges prior imagery with crystalline clarity, though "platinum compass ring, a heirloom" has minor redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and grief via skin-language perception. Emotional specificity in "blindness as different way to perceive" avoids trope through lived detail, though constellations timeframe lacks bold risk-taking.</comment>
