<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (compassion vs solitude) is embodied through book-touching and invitation handling, but epiphany lacks earned struggle; "nested paradoxes" phrasing veers toward abstract label-speak in peak beats, undermining visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: smoothed invitation note delivered at midnight crystallizes stance with visible cost (foregoing connection), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—clock chimes signal time without altering Eleanor's tactics or narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Library setting vividly described but functions as thematic backdrop rather than constraint; no tool, body detail, or micro-setting (e.g., invitation texture) actively shapes choices or charges final image beyond symbolic reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solitude vs connection) signaled early, yet pressure remains atmospheric—chimes and gathering murmur complicate but don't cohere into protagonist-driven escalation; cost is felt (emotional peace) but lacks tangible tradeoff altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through library paradoxes and invitation reprise; final bookmark image resonates without moralizing, though "wisdom often resides in spaces between" edges toward abstraction that slightly dilutes earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in book-spine tracing and clock-chime awareness; rhythmic control deepens under pressure, but "enlarged tranquility" intrudes as authorial gloss, momentarily breaking POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in opening ("Eleanor had always been...") and synonym churn ("extraordinary knowledge"/"hidden truths") dull momentum; no fatal loops, but "nested paradoxes" repetition risks thematic echo without sufficient concrete reweighting in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" synthesizes reclusiveness trope with fresh specificity; emotional truth anchors universality, yet secret society framework leans familiar without transformative world logic constraining Eleanor's choice.</comment>
