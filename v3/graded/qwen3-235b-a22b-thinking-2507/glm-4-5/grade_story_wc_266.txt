<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; "weight of a star" dragon embodiment elevates but final choice lacks visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (courage dragons) but cost remains conceptual; no on-page sentence legibly manifests felt consequence per cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ticket punch) charges final image; "liquid twilight" waterfall and black sand shore constrain no choices but achieve 9+ gate via final cavern discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure ("courage waits in quiet places") but protagonist agency lacks escalation; cost remains abstract despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through dragon metaphor; avoids moralizing but "after the leash breaks" final line edges toward thematic echo without full resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shoreline lullaby," "veiled ridgeway") modulates rhythm under pressure; collective "we" POV remains stable with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("gentle persistence"/"gentle persistence that defined them"); no figurative muddle but "patient as stone" weakens peak beat density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry guide trope with courage-as-dragons; risks lyrical structure but avoids gimmickry through concrete "star-stamp" details anchoring universals.</comment>
