<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory depth; "sacredly playful" feels tacked on despite showing in micro-choices. Final choice earned but cost insufficiently embodied during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with chess-piece placements driving progression. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost in the restored sky, though master's unexplained prior arrival creates minor causality slip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound spire functions as vital micro-setting: chess pieces constrain choices throughout, charging the final image when the sundial lid aligns with stars. Sensory details like "glowed with otherworldly blue light" serve urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending fractured sky) signaled immediately. Escalation via chess-piece placements narrows options effectively, but the master's voice introduces tension without meaningful trade-off or cost escalation at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing the unknown emerges through action ("true desire was to embrace the unknown"), avoiding moralizing. Master's "life is a strategy game" line skirts thematic echo but stays outside final paragraph, preserving earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("apprentice of wonder" lens) with rhythmic control, though "sacredly playful" intrudes as authorial voice. Consistent psychic distance but minor register drift in peak beats weakens 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("cautious abandon... heart both racing and calm") and ornamental repetition of "sacredly playful" dull propulsion. No closure artifacts, but scaffold in reflection ("Kael had once believed...") slightly drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess mechanics as reality-fixing tools transforms familiar "apprentice quest" trope. Emotional specificity in "impossible constellations" avoids abstraction, though spire premise leans on established fantasy conventions without full reinvention.</comment>
