<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("longed for their ignorance while despising their naivety") act simultaneously; final choice to continue chronicling earns closure through prior causality with visible cost in "bittersweet recognition" of mortality. Embodied emotion avoids labels ("trembling fingers," "feral nostalgia washed over him").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands unmistakably: Elias rolling the scroll and resuming writing crystallizes his acceptance of fractured time/mortality with felt cost in "bittersweet recognition." Accumulative lens holds consistently as sensory density (scroll glowing, aurora) deepens stakes toward crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mountain cabin constrains choice (isolation, upside-down snow) and charges closure: "scratches of ink on paper now sounding like mountain streams" reweights the setting as active participant. Micro-setting (birch bark scroll) evolves from disorienting artifact to tool of endurance, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative deepening: sensory saturation (symbols glowing, aurora) reweights the dominant stake (making sense of mortality) until "every grave was also a cradle" crystallizes stance. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift from "chronologically confused" to purposeful continuation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "birch bark scroll" transforms from chaotic artifact to vessel of meaning; final image of writing as "mountain streams, ancient and immediate" resonates without moralizing. Avoids false binaries by embracing complexity in "jaded wonder" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symbols that danced when he wasn't looking," "snow sometimes fell upside down") modulates rhythm under pressure. Lyric compression taught early ("time had become slippery") pays off in soaring sequence; zero head-hopping despite temporal fractures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("scratches of ink... ancient and immediate"). Near-perfect propulsion: paragraph breaks mirror emotional cadence. Minor deduction for "ethereal journey" (borderline abstract) in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "jealous of past selves" transforms mortality trope through specific emotional calculus. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "feral nostalgia" in bodily sensation. Risk-taking (nonlinear time) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the grave vision becomes cradle through earned reconfiguration.</comment>
