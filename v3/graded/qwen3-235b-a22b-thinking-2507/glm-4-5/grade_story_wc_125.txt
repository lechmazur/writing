<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between resistance/acceptance remains abstract; closure choice lacks visible cost despite strong embodied emotion through rope manipulation. "Ethically playful" trait surfaces only as label without constraining action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("irrevocably revealed") under Accumulative lens. Starlight intensifying as "universe leaned in" crystallizes pressure without causal breaks. Orientation anchored by 67 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto actively charges closure: its "breathing" walls and light absorption constrain the poet's pattern-making. Rope as micro-setting qualifies—frayed state dictates organic form, coiling at dawn shows tactile evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (temporal perception shift) tightens through pattern complexity, but "impossible choices" remain thematic abstraction. Escalation lacks felt cost—resolution feels intellectual rather than earned through sacrificed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rope's transformation from escape symbol to temporal bridge. Final image ("pattern existed now in their mind") reweights time as landscape without moralizing—earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers dancing across warm, ancient surface") and rhythmic control shine. Syntax fractures during climax ("Time, they realized...") mirroring temporal fluidity. Zero head-hopping; poetic register consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-zero loops but minor scaffold: "By uncovering layers..." repeats with slight variation. "Passionate subtlety" edges toward abstraction, though final image avoids muddle. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal physics with tactile artistry—rope as manipulable time-map avoids cliché. Transformation test passed: changing "drifting roadside poet" would break emotional specificity. Risk-taking feels inevitable.</comment>
