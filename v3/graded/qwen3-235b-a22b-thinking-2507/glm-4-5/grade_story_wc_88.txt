<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (clean slate vs. dirty past), but "jaded wonder" appears as label rather than embodied emotion in peak beats, risking diagnostic-speak penalty. Final choice to sign the ball earns empathy's cost through causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes the cyclical cost (eternal repetition to rebuild empathy), with the signing moment reconfiguring options. Lens ambiguity (Causal/Accumulative hybrid) held consistently through the time-loop causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and baseball function as micro-setting, constraining choices (tunnel symbols match ball) and charging the final image. Sensory details ("pulsing blues," "stitching under thumb") remain POV-filtered and pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling empathy) tightens through the labyrinth choice, with the time-loop revealing the cost of eternal repetition. Agency-driven escalation falters slightly when the newspaper's mechanics feel asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the baseball's cyclical journey, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("teach them again... until empathy remained") resonates as non-literal answer to the central question, with conceptual cost of endless repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("delicately robust," "jaded wonder") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression of time-loop logic taught early pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Delicately robust" and "jaded wonder" repeat as near-synonyms across adjacent beats, triggering paraphrase-loop penalty. High density otherwise, but figurative language in high-pressure beats slightly muddles immediacy (e.g., "water in my chest").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Time-loop premise transforms clichés through specific stakes (empathy as cyclical labor), with the baseball's tangible history avoiding abstraction. Emotional truth in the signing moment elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
