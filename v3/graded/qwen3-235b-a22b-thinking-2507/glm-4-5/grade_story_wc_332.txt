<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (grief vs. hope) drives micro-choices; tears at realization show embodied cost. Lacks secondary character pressure but single-POV baseline fully met. Final renunciation of preservation for communication earned through prior ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density peaks with book discovery triggering method shift. Closure as Charged Poise (tears blurring vision) crystallizes options with felt cost. "Luminous absence" reweighting makes conceptual cost undeniable without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Watercolor palette constrains studio choices; easternmost point setting pressures dawn photography. Final image charges "whispering archipelago" with meaning. Micro-setting qualifies but "whispering" aspect isn't fully leveraged for spatial choreography earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately ("capture runaway dream"); deepening via book discovery narrows options to northern island. Cost legible in tears and redefined sisterhood. Agency strong but pressure tightening lacks visceral urgency in climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light mechanics, not abstraction. Final image ("language they now both understood") reweights "luminous absence" non-literally without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite poetic phrasing; complexity in "preservation vs. acknowledgment" resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hush of improbable beginnings") with rhythmic control under pressure. Consistent 3rd-limited POV; "luminous absence" repetition functions as motif not scaffold. Minor register drift in "alchemical" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No fatal loops but "luminous absence" appears twice in critical beats (friction -0.3). High density with strategic telling ("seven years ago"). Figurative language ("murmur secrets") serves atmosphere without muddling closure's light mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief ritual transformed via light physics. "Paint with light" mechanic avoids magical convenience through specific constraints. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes; "cipher of longing" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
