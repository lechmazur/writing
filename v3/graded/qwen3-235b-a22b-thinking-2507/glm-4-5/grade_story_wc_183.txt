<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trapped freedom" duality and blurred identity boundaries, but final epiphany ("purpose for her unique existence") edges toward abstract resolution, slightly diluting embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "trapped freedom" crystallizes irreversible cost in the final tree-touching beat, with Accumulative lens holding through memory-layering escalation to the dissolving card.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned ship functions as active micro-setting—fog-thickening corridor and greenhouse direct her choices, while the emerald tree's physical presence charges the closure image with undeniable constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through memory accumulation (tightrope to lovers to "hundred stories"), narrowing options to absorption; cost is visceral in "trapped freedom" though time-pressure element remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars—lovers' stolen glances, tightrope fear—avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "garden" as chronicler role without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("blissfully aberrant," "spark waiting for fuel") persists under pressure with rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's resonant density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog pressing like curious ghosts" exemplifies textural specificity that advances atmosphere without slowing momentum, even in high-pressure memory floods.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archaeology trope through chimera twin mechanics; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
