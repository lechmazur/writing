<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but interior contradiction lacks depth; "innocently mischievous" remains label-only without flawed trade-offs under pressure. Final acceptance of sacrifice feels unearned as no visceral fear or doubt surfaces during her climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Conceptual Repricing) reweights truth's nature via refracted echoes, but cost remains abstract—"price of forgiveness" is declared not dramatized. Missing tangible price legible in final image undermines Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers function as micro-setting: their acoustics enable poetry's refractive power and charge closure as "listening spirits" become tangible pressure. Mist visibility constrains Elara's ritual-viewing tactic, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (sacrifice for plural truths) are signaled early but lack protagonist-driven escalation; Ritual Overseers shadow but never test Elara. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (echoes growing louder) without narrowing her options or deepening cost through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through refracted echoes—final "infinite variation" image reweights "white light" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite poetic lines; "truth gains power when refracted" resonates as earned CR, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (artist-eye for light/refraction) shines, but "innocently mischievous" is therapy-speak label. Minor overwriting in "ghosts of forgotten possibilities" slightly dulls pressure; otherwise rhythmic control under climax is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with strategic telling, but "refracted" repeats 5x in key beats risking synonym churn. Final "permission/liberation" phrasing borders on therapy-speak, though cadence shifts during ritual hour create propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "rebel vs. absolutism" trope through specific acoustic resistance mechanics; bone towers' physics make pluralism tangible. Risk in quiet closure pays off—conceptual stakes feel fresh without gimmickry, though emotional complexity lacks grit.</comment>
