<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans abstract; "sanely eccentric" stated not shown through micro-choices. Scarf's unraveling provides embodied cost but lacks contradictory impulses in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as strong Charged Poise (scarf dissolving into light), but two distinct non-closure issues: hyperbolic geometry feels convenient without prior struggle, and scarf's transformation lacks setup. Orientation perfect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library micro-setting constrains choices (books as gateway material); scarf's unraveling charges closure. "Scent of analog memories" and "mathematical possibility" show exquisite POV-filtered specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (scarf trembling → warming → dissolving), but "place where stories live" remains abstract until climax. Visible cost in tears and exhaustion earns high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "space between" concept without moralizing, but "observed solitude" stated twice as label. Final image reweights premise via mathematics/metaphor fusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of old paper and mathematical possibility"); rhythmic control peaks in climax cadence. No filter verbs, pure immersion in librarian's sensory world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "impossible curves defied Euclidean understanding" slightly academic for POV. "Narrative manifestations" borders jargon but doesn't dull closure's luminous simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math/poetry via library-as-organism, elevated by scarf's tangible magic. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3 bonus for specificity).</comment>
