<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich embodiment in net-mending and tea ceremony, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice (returning home) is habitual, not earned through tested values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "moon paths fade... patterns now part of him" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (unownable patterns), perfectly held under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moss-covered parapet constrains his journey after rain and charges the final image ("leaning against whispering parapet"); fireflies evolve from observation to active dialogue with his net.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (appreciating hidden effort) deepen texturally through firefly season, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; cost remains conceptual (ephemeral patterns) without tangible on-page forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: hexagonal nets mirroring honeycombs, firefly Morse code reweighting "hidden effort" without moralizing; final line resonates as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("geometry of nets," "Morse code of light") modulates with contemplative rhythm; avoids head-hopping but "demure audacity" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" register as label-heavy in peak beats; otherwise vivid propulsion through sensory compression ("frothing water into sea of ephemeral foam").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mender/philosopher through net-knots as cosmic metaphor; avoids abstraction via verifiable details (hemp mending, bamboo whisk), though moon paths verge on familiar magic.</comment>
