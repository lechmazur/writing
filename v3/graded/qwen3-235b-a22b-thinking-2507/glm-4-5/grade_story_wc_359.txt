<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("certify wonder") is abstractly stated without embodied struggle or personal stakes. Synesthesia enables actions but creates no tradeoffs or micro-choices under pressure. Tears at climax feel generic, not character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: sculpted hush reconfigures wonder's necessity with conceptual cost ("not merely decorative but essential"). Lens (Accumulative) holds through sensory density, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—ritual proceeds flawlessly without obstacles or narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern described vividly but functions as static backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Eira's tactics (e.g., cold doesn't hinder movement). Amber sheet's warmth lacks consequence. Final image charged by light/silence, but setting doesn't constrain choices to reach Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder's essential nature) signaled early but remains abstract—no concrete test of numbness versus beauty. Escalation lacks deepening: aurora cooperates perfectly, no tightening of options. Cost ("tears of joy") feels generic, not scaled to the ritual's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual's effect but undercut by final-paragraph moralizing: "proving irrefutably that such wonder was not merely decorative but essential." Thematic echo triggers -0.7 penalty; insight isn't earned through struggle but declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV stable with strong synesthetic perceptual signature, but voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—sentences stay uniformly lyrical during climax without compression. "Tears of joy flowed freely" is generic, missing micro-shifts in diction that would show stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose artifacts in closure: "warm blanket of serenity woven from starlight" (stock metaphor) and "proving irrefutably" (thematic tell) dull the image. Template cadence ("each note... each hue...") repeats in high-pressure beats, triggering -0.5 loop penalty in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh "sculpted hush" concept but executed without friction—ritual succeeds flawlessly, avoiding risk. Derivative of magical realism tropes (last guardian saves world through beauty) without transformation through specific lived detail or moral complexity.</comment>
