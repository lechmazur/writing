<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (isolation vs sudden connection) manifest in concrete micro-choices like the silent pauses while sorting memories. Final gesture mimics the stranger's offering with visible emotional cost—enduring loneliness transformed into shared grief—without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elias raises his hand: the reconfigured meaning (isolation → connection) lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the weight of another's grief now his to carry. Accumulative lens holds as memory fragments coalesce into the final resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mist-concealed dock enables the stranger's disappearance and makes the Edelweiss glow, but fails to actively constrain choices beyond passive atmosphere. Strong sensory specificity ("moon-bleached bone," "opal dock") elevates it yet falls short of 9+ gate where setting must shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (decoding the gesture) deepens through Elias's agency: investigating gaps in memories/cafe records narrows options to the war narrative. Cost manifests in his altered behavior ("silent pauses"), though escalation leans slightly passive as memories accumulate without tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—the dissolving stranger, the Edelweiss's journey from mountains to sea—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "witnessed isolation" into connection without stating it, offering resonant answer to "can strangers share grief?" through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in nautical precision ("nautical twilight," "brass cool against weathered hands") and rhythmic control during memory floods. Minor register drift in "borrowed memories flooded his mind" slightly tells rather than shows under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose soars with textured economy ("silvery glow, neither day nor night, like the surface of moon-bleached bone") but stumbles in flower description: "fragile but complete, pressed flat... yet somehow still vital" suffers paraphrase-loop redundancy, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through hyper-specific stakes (Edelweiss origins, war grief) and emotional precision. Risk-taking (memory gaps as evidence) heightens coherence; the stranger's dissolution into mist feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
