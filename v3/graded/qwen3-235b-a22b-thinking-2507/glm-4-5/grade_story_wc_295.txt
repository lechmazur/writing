<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; healing motivation clear but no visible struggle when sharing burden. Micro-choices absent during pivotal translation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("not meant to be carried alone"), but causality falters when Thorne's entrance resolves tension too neatly without prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory setting charges final image ("sun rose fully, casting warm light"), with telescope and telegram constraining choices. Sensory specificity elevates celestial mechanics into lived experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she deciphers stars, but cost remains abstract until closure; "healing wisdom" urgency lacks visceral tradeoffs during translation process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment><comment>Theme emerges through shared burden motif, but final paragraph moralizes ("some knowledge was meant to be discovered not in isolation"), undermining earned resonance with explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in celestial observations, but dialogue lacks subtext; Thorne's lines serve exposition rather than revealing status dynamics or hidden motives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until climax where clinical phrasing ("activated by the shared burden") disrupts immersion; minor synonym loops in final paragraph dull closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy and linguistics feels inevitable, but "heals with words" trope remains underdeveloped; specificity in variable star mechanics elevates beyond template.</comment>
