<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (destruction/preservation) drives choices, but "arsonist's knowledge" in restoration feels stated not embodied; micro-choices lack sufficient struggle during pivotal repair scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: weaving fragment into library entrance reconfigures destruction/renewal with visible cost ("years passed" labor); Accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archive setting functions as micro-setting: tapestry fragment constrains choices (tracing threads) and charges closure (woven into entrance); "volcanic tenderness" motif evolves from abstract to embodied in restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: each artistic clue deepens understanding until final tapestry reweights destruction/preservation; cost legible in Maya's years of underground labor foreclosing her past life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: tapestry restoration becomes non-literal answer to "can destroyers preserve?"; avoids moralizing by showing rather than stating the "ashes to beauty" transformation in final library image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("analytically intuitive" framing clues) persists under pressure; volcanic tenderness repetition slightly flattens voice modulation during climax but closure image redeems lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("trembling hands" repetition) and slight register drift in "volcanic tenderness" usage; high density maintained but restoration sequence has 2 redundant sensory descriptions dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist/archivist trope through tapestry memory device; "vandalized self-portrait as map" twist feels earned. Avoids safety middle by making redemption contingent on embracing destruction rather than erasing it.</comment>
