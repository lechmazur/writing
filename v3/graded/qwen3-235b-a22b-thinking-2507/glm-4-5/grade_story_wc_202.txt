<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in scene; final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. Strong motivation ("honor overlooked histories") but no visible flaw complicating the pivotal moment. Micro-choices absent under pressure—she simply touches fragment to painting without tactical adaptation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with legible conceptual cost: "histories long overlooked flood into the present." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening ("colors swirl," "constellations"), but escalation lacks middle development—tension rises linearly without deepening choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: lighthouse fragment constrains choice (used as key) and charges final image ("glows with warm light"). Alchemist's market provides vivid atmosphere but functions as backdrop rather than actively pressuring tactics. Misses 9+ gate by hair—environment doesn’t narrow options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking histories) signaled early but never tested with concrete opposition; market "holds its breath" instead of applying pressure. Conceptual cost ("burden of legacy") legible yet abstract—no visceral stakes or visible price altering tactics during the pivotal act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: final image ("child will find their own fragment") offers resonant, non-literal answer to preserving silenced histories. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity—conceptual repricing reweights the fragment’s purpose without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("elusively tangible," "dreamscape suspended") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift: "anchors of intuition" feels academic amid lyrical prose. Experimental compression (time suspension) taught early and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with zero loops, but reflection exceeds BRR limits: "For years, I studied..." compresses time without altering present tactics. Final paragraph slightly overwrought ("perfect circle of understanding"), though closure remains clear and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "hidden histories" via art translation, grounded in concrete details (lens physics, market mechanics). Emotional truth in generational duty elevates familiar "translator" trope, though core premise lacks revolutionary risk-taking.</comment>
