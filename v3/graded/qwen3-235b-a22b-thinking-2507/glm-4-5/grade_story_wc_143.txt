<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict; "purposefully curious" trait is stated but never creates tradeoffs under pressure. Motivation is clear and embodied emotion strong (e.g., "heart swelled with dawnlit melancholy"), yet no contradictory impulses act simultaneously during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: dissolving sand grain and vanished fireflies crystallize the cost of preservation. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dawning light's progression tightens pressure relentlessly toward the vanishing point with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nightwatch's sand grain functions as micro-setting, constraining timing tactics and charging the final image (empty chamber). Sensory details like "breathing amplified in helmet" are selective and purpose-driven, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document fireflies before dawn) tightens through Accumulative escalation as light intensifies; Elena's endurance forecloses the path of delay with visible cost (dissolved grain, vanished spectacle). Agency is clear though opposition is environmental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete particulars: final image of "sunlit summit" and approaching miners reweights "progress" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while the dissolving sand grain embodies the conceptual cost of time's passage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (technical precision blended with emotional weight) shines in lines like "chemical reaction would begin slowly." Minor register drift in "melancholy settled deep in her bones" slightly undermines lunar-inspector voice during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "dawning hush" repeats four times with near-identical phrasing in high-pressure beats. Strong verbs ("disintegrating," "crystallized") elevate imagery, but scaffold phrasing dilutes the climax's urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction narrative through lunar-specific mechanics (chemical timing, space-age context). Emotional truth in quiet preservation resonates, though "solemn witness" trope limits bold risk-taking despite memorable setting integration.</comment>
