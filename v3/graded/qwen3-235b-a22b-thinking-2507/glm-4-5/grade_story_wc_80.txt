<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("stoically sensitive") stated but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory actions; diagnostic label weakens embodiment. Final choice to add personal note lacks visible cost escalation beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weighted by responsibility") under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening (recovery/addition of note) suffices for length, but escalation lacks pressure transformation beyond density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion constrains choices (diving necessity, drawbridge timing) and charges final "hushed blaze" image. Inkwell functions as micro-setting that evolves from tool to emotional anchor, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency (adding personal note) under Accumulative lens; cost ("responsibility") unmistakably legible in inkwell's weight. Single tightening suffices, though pressure remains atmospheric rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through preservation cubes and inkwell mechanics, avoiding moralizing. Final "hushed blaze" offers resonant non-literal answer to "measuring dreams" question, with closure charging prior material through emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("marble pillars jutted like silent sentinels") with rhythmic control, but "stoically sensitive" diagnostic label breaks interiority. Elision of backstory taught early and paid off through capsule recoveries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("resisted the water's pull"/"nature's grip tightened") and filter-verb adjacency ("practiced movements betraying years"). Propulsion strong but density falters in reflective moments; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor/archeologist role through preservation cubes avoids cliché. Emotional specificity in "spaces between moments" elevates premise, though "archeologist of abandoned dreams" phrase edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
