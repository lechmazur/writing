<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trembling not with fear but with reverence," embodying patience through breath-rhythm with earth. Final choice earns closure via visible cost of misstep consequences, but solo POV limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: "one misstep... hope lost forever" made visceral when seal succeeds. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density escalation in pattern assembly reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: frost-brittle leaves demand careful handling, altering the alchemist's pace. Final orchard rebirth charges closure image, though subarctic wind's impact remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—each added element (berries, stones) heightens fragility. Cost is unmistakable in "one misstep... starlight dissipate," narrowing options to flawless execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "moving stillness" motif resolving in reborn orchard's glow—a non-literal answer to darkness. Avoids moralizing; complexity lies in patience as both burden and salvation without false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bark peeling in delicate scrolls" reveals alchemist's observational bias. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in short sentences during seal climax, though minor filter verbs ("focus was not") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "frost-encased berries" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor artifact: "trembling not with fear but with reverence" risks therapy-speak but saved by contextual "power," preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes via "flash-paper" specificity and heartbeat-to-maps premise. Emotional truth in quiet resolve avoids quirky ornamentation; subarctic crater setting feels necessary, not decorative.</comment>
