<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "desperately jocular" performance masking serious gambit, embodied in cracked voice during forced optimism. Flaw: disaster-relief expertise remains ornamental rather than constraining key choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost in "bound by reciprocity still" revealing enduring loneliness despite success. Orientation flawless in opening paragraph; only hairline slip is slightly telescoped rumor timeline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station functions as vital micro-setting—constrains choices as neutral ground and charges final image as "heart of an operation." Missing: deeper sensory pressure during pivotal rumor-planning beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as rumor success reveals deeper cost—connection achieved but reciprocity trap remains. Agency clear in catalysis attempt; only flaw: "cure" realization borders on convenient without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rumor mechanics—connection via shared fiction—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights reciprocity as "community grateful though never know his name," earning resonance without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "polite anarchy" framing and rhythmic control ("improbable rumor had traveled through sixty-seven distinct channels"). Minor typo ("Arrie") but no head-hopping; compression taught early via shard transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "waves of ivy" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s cadence ("grateful to him though they'd never know his name") recharges motif with perfect propulsion. Slight overwriting risk in rumor spread count avoided by accumulative purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "loneliness cure" trope through logistician’s lens—rumor as disaster-relief tactic feels inevitable. Risk-taking (pumice deception) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
