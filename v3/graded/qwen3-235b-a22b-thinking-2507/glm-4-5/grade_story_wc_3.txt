<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is implied but not dramatized; "kindly methodical" trait lacks visible tradeoffs during analogical breakthrough. Backstory anchors motivation but "haunted ambitions" remains thematic rather than driving present-tense micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("accumulated thoughts" in seed weight), but the transition from study to journey lacks causal tightening—packing occurs in one undramatized beat, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed functions as micro-setting charging the final image, but Pamir Mountains setting lacks tactile specificity; atmospheric conditions described generically ("rumored to graze") without constraining her tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through analogical thinking, but "haunted ambitions" threat remains abstract backstory without present-tense manifestation; conceptual cost is legible yet lacks visceral friction as Elara transitions smoothly from terror to purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through seed motif ("unbroken continuum" reweights transition as spiritual evolution), avoiding moralizing. Final image resonates but "physics of transition" concept stays slightly abstract despite seed's physicality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct academic-perceptual signature ("proto-Indo-European," "VAT 9529") modulates beautifully, but voice lacks compression under stress—packing sequence uses uniformly lyrical phrasing instead of fragmented urgency during high-stakes preparation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in "haunted ambitions... overwhelming desire" (lines 14-15) creates scaffold; "second heartbeat" cliché dilutes seed's embodiment. Minor artifacts in first third avoid closure impact but prevent higher band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform scholarship with speculative physics elevates trope, but "knowledge fruit seed" echoes common fantasy motifs without sufficient transformation; academic framing prevents derivative cap.</comment>
