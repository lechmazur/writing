<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during repair climax; "steadiest hands" thought hints at struggle but no simultaneous conflicting urges. Strengths: embodied blindness as constraint, micro-choices like water bowl placement revealing values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (connection across distance) under Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: phone confirmation feels coincidental rather than earned pressure. Final image reconfigures "sighted perception" with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist functions as active constraint slowing time during repair; water bowl charges closure through drone's hovering ballet. Ship's steam clearing mist creates causal pressure on tactics. Rail depot specificity anchors without over-description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Time pressure from anchor lifting tightens stakes, but repair process lacks visible cost escalation. "Steadier hands" thought hints at struggle but no tangible price paid during action. Ship's departure provides sufficient closure cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through drone repair as metaphor for connection, but final paragraph's explicit "maintained a connection" statement violates subtext rule. Cost of isolation reweights premise via final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tactile/auditory focus) modulates rhythm under pressure. "Steam rising," "metal chains straining" filter setting through Elias' blindness. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor template cadence ("Elias positioned... Elias thought... Elias worked") in para 3. Otherwise exemplary propulsion: "crystal bowl of water" sentence integrates setting/action/theme. Zero loops in peak repair beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness as perceptual advantage transforms repair trope. Water refraction method feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Emotional specificity in "hands moved like magic" avoids sentimentality while deepening teacher-student bond.</comment>
