<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "muse" and "eloquently silent" are unearned traits without embodied tradeoffs. "Heart steady" contradicts high-stakes moment with implausible calm. No visible cost in final choice beyond document acquisition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("ancestors would finally rest"), but reflection exceeds 20% BRR limit (22%), causing momentum loss in escalation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through standing wave intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sepia reading room functions as micro-setting: ceiling carving guides action, golden shadows charge final image. Gramophone crank constrains choices via frequency-tuning precision. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile tool interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (dynasty legitimacy) tighten via standing wave activation, but pressure lacks protagonist agency—discovery relies on device mechanics rather than earned choice. Cost remains abstract until final image ("ancestors rest").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonance motif, but "truth would finally reign" triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty. Final image reweights "first yawn of evening" with conceptual cost, though moralizing edges undercut earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via "sepia"/"golden shadows" filter, but "eloquently silent" repetition creates voice convergence. Tension modulates effectively until final paragraph’s explanatory shift ("would present this evidence").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Zero closure-touched artifacts, but "golden shadows" paraphrase loop (-0.2) and filter-verb stack ("began to muse"/"mind formed") in high-pressure beat (-0.5). Propulsion falters during reflection block.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics with historical intrigue, but "bridge of intuition" feels derivative. Risk-taking heightens stakes (non-violent resolution), though gramophone mechanism lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
