<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation rooted in lineage and the watch fob's mechanics; contradictory impulses (caution vs urgency) manifest in false starts. Minor abstraction in "comforting unease" slightly dilutes embodied emotion during high stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: each lie escalates pressure toward the truce-breaking climax. Cost is unmistakable in Malachi's realization and the shattered alliance. Parrot detail slightly ornamental but closure lands with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rotting pier setting pressures choices (proximity for whispers, hiding spots), but sensory specificity lacks during critical beats—e.g., how dampness affects the watch fob's mechanics. Sunrise image effectively charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing trust-break sound) signaled immediately; pressure escalates through three false starts that narrow options. Cost is visceral in Malachi's realization. "Comforting unease" slightly over-explains tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: lies fracturing trust reweights "sound" as capturable. Final image ("sound of betrayal... safely contained") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Zero abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence that screams," "comforting unease") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor detachment in "curiously steadfast" label once, but voice modulates brilliantly during the truce fracture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("time slipping through fingers like damp sea air" compresses time and stakes). Final line crystallizes theme with surgical precision. One weak modifier ("strangely") negligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: watch fob capturing "trust-breaking sound" transforms noir tropes. Avoids abstraction—pirate market feels lived-in, "comforting unease" tone consistently modulated. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
