<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "rapidly adapting" trait stated but not tested under pressure. Patch serves as reminder without altering choices, missing micro-choice opportunities during key observations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No closure unit: ends with procedural review lacking reconfiguration or cost. Orientation debt (who/where delayed past 120 words) triggers -0.3. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural intended but closure fails cost test).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Shipping containers constrain movement but don't charge final image. Strong sensory specificity in wind patterns, yet setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active constraint during critical observations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("solve mystery") without visceral test. Pressure builds through data collection but no narrowing of options or trade-off; distortion discovery lacks consequence for Elena's tactics or safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Cultivate foresight" stated but not dramatized through earned sacrifice. Final image of silent town lacks thematic reweighting; theme operates as authorial concept rather than emergent property of Elena's choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wind documentation; rhythmic control during data collection. Minor register drift ("hazy precision" as clinical term) slightly disrupts immersion in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; strong propulsion in container navigation sequences. Overwriting in "meditative rhythm" paragraph slightly dilutes pressure; "frayed but distinct" patch description edges toward generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh port-city forensic angle but "singular convergence" feels derivative of disaster tropes. Bold atmospheric specificity elevates, yet resolution safety-hedges by avoiding Elena's personal risk exposure.</comment>
