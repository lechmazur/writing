<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; motivation crystallizes late without showing simultaneous conflicting impulses during key transitions. Flaws remain abstract despite vivid sensory cataloging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "determination burned brighter" crystallizes refusal with visible cost (spent shard, fading dreams). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density of reality-hopping until the dimming shard's final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dust motes and green glass constrain choices—dust frames time, glass enables transitions—but repair bay's disarray doesn't actively pressure tactics. Final image's dim shard charges closure through recurring object specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (truth discovery) tighten through accumulated realities, but escalation relies more on external phenomena than protagonist agency. Cost is clear (depleted shard), yet the "cyclically spontaneous" transitions lack felt struggle in navigation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory mapping as embodied truth-seeking, but "withheld truth" phrasing borders on abstraction. Final image reweights discovery as endurance without moralizing, though thematic resonance lacks the 9+ non-literal punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "ridges pulsing with forgotten histories," but stress-induced compression falters during transitions. Rhythmic control under pressure holds, though "cyclically spontaneous" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor cadence loop in reality-hopping descriptions ("In alternate timelines... In other realities...") dulls momentum. Otherwise high density with clean propulsion, but final paragraph's "would-be discoveries receded" slightly overwrites the dim shard's concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping and multiverse tropes, but "withheld truth" motivation feels familiar. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off, though the repair bay's abandonment lacks transformative specificity to reach 9+.</comment>
