<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (recorder vs participant in time) embodied in seed arrangement; final choice to touch vortex earned by biological clock urgency. Slight underdevelopment of physical struggle during high-pressure moments prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with undeniable cost: "texture of borrowed time was... texture of herself." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—entropy decrease pattern culminates in vortex manifestation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: frost on jars constrains movement ("bare feet finding purchase"), while starlight directly charges final image ("under starlight... fragile and yet eternal"). Physical stakes could heighten during seed placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: seed arrangement’s decreasing entropy scale narrows options to the final jar placement. Cost crystallizes in "fragile and yet eternal" realization—conceptual price of merging with time is viscerally legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embodied action: "reached toward it not to collect... but simply to touch." Final image reweights time’s texture as selfhood without moralizing—resonant non-literal answer to "what is borrowed time?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: scientific precision ("decreasing scale of entropy") merges with poetic compression ("frost dancing like captured fireflies"). Rhythmic control tightens under pressure ("intentional breaths," "hand trembled not with fear").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("oak acorn cap, worn smooth by generations of handling both physical and temporal"). Final line’s "fragile and yet eternal" crystallizes theme without muddle. No figurative slack in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heirloom seed saving meets temporal physics. "Decreasing entropy" as method transforms mortality trope into tactile quest. Risk-taking (dense poetic science) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"texture of time" as selfhood feels inevitable.</comment>
