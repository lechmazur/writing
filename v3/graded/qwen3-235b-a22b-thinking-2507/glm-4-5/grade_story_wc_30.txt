<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (keeper/kept, fighting/accepting identity shifts) with earned endurance choice. Final whisper "adds another layer" crystallizes visible cost of dissolving fixed self without sentimentality. No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment in "water flowed over titan-gear with gentle hiss" during transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: "who emerged... was neither archivist nor story-weaver" crystallizes identity migration with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through tidal/moon imagery payoff. Cost proof: "identities migrating like tides" makes loss of fixed self legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal atrium actively constrains choices (submerging texts requiring armor) and charges closure via "waters, these identities forever in flux." Bamboo creel functions as micro-setting across three beats, evolving from fisherman's tool to vessel for "essence of forgotten tales" in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder amid identity flux) tightens when librarian stops "fighting changes" and actively smelts stories. Agency clear in acceptance-driven synthesis; cost visceral in "water flowed over titan-gear" during migration. Moral calculus crystallizes in "contradiction of being both librarian and library."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: smelting fragments, tidal submersion, identity synthesis. Final image "wandering tales find home" reweights premise with conceptual cost (stories altered by submersion). Avoids moralizing; "preserve wonder in routine" dramatized through empty-hall recitations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends mechanical ("titan-gear," "hiss") and organic ("wintersun serenity," "liquid story-silver"). Rhythm shifts from flowing description to clipped transformation beats. Patterned moon-phase repetition taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid story-silver" precise metaphor. Sentence variety supports pressure (long descriptive vs. short "Who emerged..." climax). Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs. Minor deduction for "wintersun serenity" slight register drift in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes via tidal mechanics and identity migration. Emotional truth in preserving wonder for "visitors who might occasionally appear" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (non-linear time) heightens stakes; "synthesis of all previous selves" resists cliché with specificity.</comment>
