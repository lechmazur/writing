<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (tracing glass, channeling vitality) but emotional shift lacks embodied contradiction during climax; "emotional numbness" stated clinically without sufficient physical manifestation in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (Maya embracing pain to vivify brain), but "complementary opposites" method isn't dramatized as active struggle—escalation lacks one beat where duality fails or strains tactics under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Floating dojo and brain jar described vividly, but setting doesn't constrain choices; trembling during rewrite offers no tactical pressure, though final glow charges closure image with conceptual weight for duplicate consciousness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vivify before history rewrites) clear, but escalation underaccumulative lens lacks visible deepening—method works on first attempt without meaningful failure or adjustment; cost (emotional pain) felt but not intensified during action sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness autonomy emerges through concrete particulars (brain's awakening, "no longer just a duplicate"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights clone battle conceptually without stating moral, though "emotional numbness" phrasing risks clinical detachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fortress against feeling," "shimmer in sky") modulates effectively under pressure; syntactic rhythm tightens during vivification, though "cosmic transformations" slips toward generic abstraction in high-stakes moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("allowing herself to feel again, embracing the pain") dulls immediacy in climax; otherwise clean propulsion, but final line's "exponential potential" slightly overwrites conceptual closure with thematic assertion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clone tropes via "complementary opposites" method grounded in Maya's ego death; emotional specificity transforms derivative elements (floating dojo) into meaningful pressure, though corporate/rebel backdrop remains underdeveloped.</comment>
