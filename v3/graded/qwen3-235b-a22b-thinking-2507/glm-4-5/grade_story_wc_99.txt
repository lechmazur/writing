<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("RBG hands" trembling) and micro-choices reveal values, but contradictory impulses during ritual lack sufficient friction; final endurance earned though cost remains emotional rather than tangible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with conceptual cost ("cerulean regret transformed into peace"); Accumulative lens holds through lace pattern shifts, though brief backstory risks orientation but is anchored by storm cue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Compass on lace functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges closure via prismatic colors; environment evolves causally from rain to dew, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through tutor's agency as lace pattern shifts from concentration to diffusion, reweighting options; conceptual cost is legible though "diffuse accumulated sorrow" slightly abstracts the tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (compass glow as "color of unspoken apologies"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "severance" with resonant ambiguity about reconciliation's limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("slow-spoken," lace as text) with rhythmic control; compression of backstory taught early via storm cue, though "cerulean regret" borders on thematic but fits voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("prismatic colors shifted and danced") advances atmosphere and closure; figurative language consistently serves purpose without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bonsai patience, lace cryptography, and ghost compass transforms tropes; emotional specificity in "unspoken apologies as color" avoids generic templates while feeling inevitable.</comment>
