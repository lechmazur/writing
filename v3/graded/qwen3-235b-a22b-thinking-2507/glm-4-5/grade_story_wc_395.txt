<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong motivation but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "brightly attentive" stated not shown through micro-choices. Diagnostic phrasing like "digital ghosts" weakens embodied emotion during high-stakes breach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (truth hunted but not yet safe), but causality breaks: fabricated credentials lack setup, 90-second timer feels arbitrary. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant but causal gaps) blocks 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Archive setting remains backdrop not constraint; no tool/environment alters tactics. "Digital necropolis" and "ghosts" are generic metaphors failing the 9+ gate. Sensory detail lacks professional specificity for a memory keeper's workflow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate credibly to download moment, but dominant "find truth" stake stays abstract despite physical actions. Security alarms ring with no tangible cost shown—conceptual price (career/freedom) mentioned but not viscerally felt per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through particulars (patch, numbers), but final line states moral ("truth cannot be deleted") violating organic emergence rule. No non-literal reweighting; Stellaris revelation explains rather than resonates with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice has rhythmic control under pressure, but "digital ghosts" and "symphony half-remembered" are overwritten, flattening perceptual signature. Consistent focalization, yet corporate lexicon ("custodians," "digital footprint") drifts into academic register during tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Loops weaken momentum: "digital ghosts... lingered in coded silence" then "digital static like ghosts." Purple prose ("constellations in a dark sky") muddles high-pressure beats. Final third artifacts block 9+ despite strong opening cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Competent trope synthesis (corporate noir + sci-fi mystery) but "731" recurrence feels arbitrary, not inevitable. Stellaris twist echoes common sci-fi tropes without fresh inflection; emotional truth lacks specificity beyond generic "truth matters" stance.</comment>
