<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear/intoxication) is embodied but lacks visceral micro-choices; the final merger feels conceptual rather than earned through concrete stakes. Epiphanies lean abstract in peak moments like "time wasn't linear."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (merging with garden) with conceptual cost, but the disintegration climax lacks escalation payoff—the pressure buildup doesn't fully earn the final sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds cleanly through temporal density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains choices via shifting paths, yet its physicality fades during disintegration; the final image lacks tactile specificity to charge closure per 9+ gate. Strong sensory weaving otherwise, like "vibrant green tendrils pulsing with breath."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Elara's agency (navigating temporal folds), but the threat remains passive—time dissolving her connection lacks active opposition. Cost is legible conceptually yet feels detached from bodily consequence in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through fading photographs and hyperbolic paths, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights time's "woven nature" non-literally, but over-explained concepts like "quaking reverie" slightly blunt resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV stability and perceptual signature shine ("texture of time" as designer lens), yet filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") dilute immediacy during disintegration. Rhythmic control falters under peak stress with uniform lyrical cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("terrifying yet intoxicating") and abstract phrasing in temporal sequences reduce propulsion. Strong opening anchors but final disintegration lacks textural grit; no critical artifacts, yet density wavers near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry with temporal perception avoids cliché; "living bridge garden" transforms tropes through embodied stakes. Risk-taking (abstract time travel) heightens meaning without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
