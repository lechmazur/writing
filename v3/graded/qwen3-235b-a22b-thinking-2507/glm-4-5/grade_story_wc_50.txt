<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elara's "peripherally focused mind" drives method; embodied emotion via marble warming to approval. Final choice earned through accumulation of small revelations, though micro-choices lack specific tactical tradeoffs during calibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (weight of preserving echoes), Accumulative lens holds through reflection mapping. "Wounded season" pressure lacks tangible tightening—timeframe doesn’t constrict tactics despite being central premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern functions as micro-setting: its reflective surfaces actively constrain repair method and charge final image (swirling reflections coalescing into echoes). Sensory specificity ("glistening surfaces," "thrumming vibrated through cavern floor") integrates flawlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repairing echoes) signaled early, deepening via reflection mapping. But "wounded season" pressure remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics—no live option foreclosed by seasonal urgency despite its centrality to premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions (calibrating gears to preserve echoes), but final line "wonder stored where reason could keep it safe" states thesis explicitly, triggering thematic echo penalty in peak closure moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peripherally focused vision caught patterns") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from reflective to urgent during timer's awakening; no head-hopping. Patterned elision of failed repair attempts taught early and paid off in methodical process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("settled in her mind like dust on ancient cavern floor"). Final line’s elevated diction ("wonder stored where reason could keep it safe") clashes with POV lexicon, causing register drift in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "fixing broken object" trope through specific physics of light/reflection; emotional truth in "accumulation of small revelations." Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "wounded season" metaphor lacks fresh inflection beyond established seasonal melancholy.</comment>
