<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses (rejecting curses yet bracing for misfortune) manifest physically in raw fingers and the diamond’s warmth; her final choice to protect truth earns closure through reassembly labor and corporate stakes, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands via causal lens: reassembled letters → diamond’s true purpose → decision to become keeper, with tangible cost ("fate worse than liquidation"); orientation anchors within 120 words (wasteland, liquidation, her role).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard’s radioactive dust storms and glowing soil actively constrain choices (toxic soil investigation), charging the final image where the storm rages yet life thrives through the diamond’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maya’s agency: reassembly reveals stillpoint → corporate weaponization threat → her protective stance crystallization; stakes narrow to immediate survival ("fate worse than liquidation") with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "hope... couldn’t liquidate" reweights "cursed" diamond into salvation without moralizing; final image of warmth→hope avoids sentimentality while rejecting corporate deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sharply observant eyes" filter details like soil’s glow and tree lean; syntax modulates under pressure (short sentences during storm approach), avoiding filter verbs and POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("truth had become rarest commodity" → later "salvation or destruction"); figurative language serves causality without muddle; final line’s "ashes of deception" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via specific logic: "liquidation" as corporate purge, radiation-to-life via diamond’s inclusion; emotional truth in shift from debunker to truth-keeper with risk-taking quiet climax.</comment>
