<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation shifts from bitterness to witness are embodied through micro-choices (watering vines while observing gremlins), but the final renunciation lacks sufficient contradictory impulses under pressure despite strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with "cultivate the frostbitten hope" foreclosing academic capture; cost is legible via the arrowhead's warmth against Aris's "professional bitterness," though the Accumulative lens tightens slightly late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underground garden functions as essential micro-setting: moon-petal flowers and star-vine directly constrain choices (watering withering plants), while "frostbitten hope" charges the final image as a hardy perennial blooming impossibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around documenting vs. protecting, with the arrowhead's luminous patterns deepening knowledge under Accumulative pressure, but the lunar eclipse revelation edges toward external coincidence rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" emerges through bioluminescent mushrooms and gravity-defying gremlins rather than statements; the final "cosmic joke" reweights academic bitterness into witness without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "flint arrowhead sharp against fingertips" and static-laden confessions, though "gravitationally playful" momentarily drifts from Aris's researcher lexicon during high-pressure observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "recognized the core concept that animated..." and two "frostbitten hope" repetitions create subtle momentum drag, but sentence propulsion and sensory specificity remain exceptionally controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptozoology through stone-to-flesh gremlins and "harmony untamed" avoids tropes; risk-taking in quiet Earned Stasis ending heightens stakes without gimmickry while maintaining conceptual integrity.</comment>
