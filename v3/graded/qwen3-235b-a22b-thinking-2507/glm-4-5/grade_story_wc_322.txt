<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear (sister quest) but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; "texture of connection" label triggers diagnostic penalty. Embodied emotion strong except final reunion oversimplified.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost of redefining connection, but "jolt of recognition" feels unearned; lens (Hybrid) holds though causality wobbles during eruption sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Optical illusions actively constrain choices (walls breathing, emotions materializing); sinew thread as micro-setting charges final image when Elias touches it. Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding sister) tightens through thread eruption, but Elias remains passive observer; cost of reunion (lost art? reality?) feels abstract despite strong escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through sinew thread mechanics ("weaving connection"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "rational enchantment" with conceptual cost of shared vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sinew thread pulsing with memories") with rhythmic control; filter-verb stack in para 3 ("he was convinced that if he could understand...") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but paraphrase loop: "memories altered" verbatim repeat in para 5/6 dulls closure beat; "realistically imaginary" recurrence lacks evolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream logic + textile craft; transforms "lost sibling" trope through sinew thread mechanics. Risk-taking (Hybrid lens) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
