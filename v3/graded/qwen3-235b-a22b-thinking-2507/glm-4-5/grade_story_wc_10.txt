<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied observation ("fingers tracing invisible melodies") but backstory trauma told via label ("capsize survivor had lost everything") rather than present-choice friction; diagnostic "trauma" in closure triggers -0.4 penalty per rubric.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("rectified the world's loss of sound"), but no persistent constraint (e.g., tuning fork limitations) shapes tactics to meet 9+ gate; orientation perfect within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Winterglass amplifies heat patterns functionally, yet fails 9+ gate by not constraining choices or charging final image; "crystalline silence" description vivid but static, missing micro-setting pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("rectify the great wrong of silence"), escalation via density increase (mapping plant responses) under Accumulative lens, but agency remains observational—no trade-off or tactical shift narrows options as required for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through heat-patterns-as-music without moralizing, yet "unshaken marvels" recurrence functions as thematic echo without constraining choices; final image reweights silence as expressive but token repetition lowers resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in heat-pattern observation, but "unshaken marvels" phrase loops with identical cadence across beats; voice contamination via label drift ("capsize survivor" title vs. pronoun) undermines consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity except adjacent paraphrase loop: "unshaken marvels of their own creation" followed by "unshaken marvels of nature" triggers -0.2; minor scaffold in backstory summary avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia/post-apocalyptic music; "heat-mapping emotions" transforms tropes through specific stakes. Risk in Accumulative structure heightens coherence, though "winterglass" concept edges near genre familiarity without full transformation.</comment>
