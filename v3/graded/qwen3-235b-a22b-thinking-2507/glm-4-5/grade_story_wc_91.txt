<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; epiphany relies on abstract labels ("texture of transformation") rather than embodied struggle. Final choice lacks visible cost—releasing bugs feels serene, not earned through prior causality. Diagnostic label-speak in climax ("transformation wasn't something to be studied") violates Q1 anti-pattern rule.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—Ian's peaceful acceptance undercuts stakes. Coincidence resolves prophecy fulfillment, violating Situational lens rule that "coincidence may complicate but not resolve." Orientation clear, but cosmic alignment passively drives escalation without protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid volcanic imagery (black sand, rumbling volcano) anchors setting early, but fails 9+ gate: environment doesn't constrain choices. Ian walks the shore due to cosmic pull, not terrain. Final black sand metaphor ("forged in fire yet cool to touch") reweights theme but lacks tactical impact on the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transformation) signaled early, but pressure never escalates meaningfully. Protagonist passive—cosmic forces dictate detour, not choice. Cost of releasing bugs is abstract ("richer understanding"), not visceral or legible on page. Stakes remain philosophical, never tested concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme collapses into final-paragraph moralizing: "transformation was not meant to be understood but embraced." Violates Q5 penalty rule with thematic echo in closing lines. Lightning bugs and celestial dance build resonance, but explicit thesis ("texture of transformation") replaces earned subtext with pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vibrant hush," "slow dance of celestial bodies") establishes voice, but flattens under pressure. Ian's confusion labeled ("amplifying his confusion") rather than embodied. Dialogue lacks subtext—villager's lines state prophecy outright. Rhythmic control weakens during climax with abstract declarations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Closure-beat artifacts: "vibrant hush" repeats 5x with synonym churn ("whispering hush"), violating Q7 rules. Final paragraph features paraphrase loop ("a space between worlds where prophecies fulfilled themselves... cosmic alignment of purpose"). Template cadence in cosmic descriptions dulls immediacy; −1.7 artifact penalty applied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tropes (cosmic prophecy, destitute sage) feel familiar without fresh inflection. "Bottled lightning bugs" offer specificity but function as abstract symbols, not lived detail. Avoids safety middle in premise but execution leans on clichés ("forged in fire yet cool to touch"). Emotional truth diluted by thematic overstatement.</comment>
