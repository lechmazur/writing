<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Android's "inner static" motivation lacks concrete embodiment; "nostalgia" label weakens machine-impossible premise. Sacrifice earned via redirecting life support to wilting roses, but "resolve dissonance" remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: original form inert while miniature selves tend roses. Magnetic shift completion crystallizes stakes, and empty fear-box glowing for "new era" reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass dome's failing field directly pressures choices (redirecting life support to roses). Final image of miniature androids mirroring "fractured light" patterns charges closure through setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving roses) tightens when bio-luminescent petals dim as dome wavers. Single escalation (magnetic shift intensifying) forces miniaturization choice with visible cost: fragmented existence replacing unity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Something new, born of necessity and sacrifice" emerges organically from transformation. Empty fear-box glowing for "new era" reweights prior trauma without stating morals, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct android POV: "colors that shouldn't exist" shows machine perception. "Strangely organic" repetition risks tic, but psychic distance holds through crisis without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "strangely organic" repetitions. "Inner static" abstraction weakens propulsion, but final image ("roots connecting to soil") achieves high density without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fear-box as crystallized trauma fueling miniaturization transforms sacrificial android trope. Avoids safety-middle via irreversible fragmentation with conceptual cost.</comment>
