<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("anxious elation," "purposefully curious") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices lack character-specific tradeoffs despite coherent motivation. Final realization feels earned but lacks visceral struggle during peak ritual moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing (covenant's true nature revealed) with causal escalation, but cost remains abstract ("burden lift" told not shown). Orientation anchors solid by para 1, yet missing on-page cost image weakens Q2's 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cobalt glade's blue light intensifies meaningfully during maze traversal, charging the final transformation image. However, setting functions atmospherically rather than constraining choices—no environmental pressure alters tactics despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten coherently as visionary enters miniature maze, with scar-linking narrowing options toward the center. But the "cost" (prior confinement lifting) is narratively resolved without felt consequence, missing the visible price required for 8.8+ under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ritual action: covenant's redefinition ("coexist in harmony") avoids moralizing while reweighting the entire premise. Final image crystallizes thematic resonance without abstraction—"intersection of dreams" becomes lived truth through sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in cobalt-tinted details ("blue-tinted grass shimmered"), but stress-induced compression falters—"anxious elation" repeats as label without rhythmic modulation. Lyric consistency elevates tension though minor register drift occurs in exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overwriting dilutes pressure: "purposefully curious" and "anxious elation" recur as abstract labels rather than embodied action. Template cadence ("As dusk deepened...") appears in high-stakes ritual beat, but no closure-dulling loops prevent 8.0+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-reality tropes through scar-linking mechanics and cobalt light physics. Risk-taking in conceptual resolution (covenant as harmony not separation) feels inevitable, though glade setting edges toward archetypal lyricism without full transformation.</comment>
