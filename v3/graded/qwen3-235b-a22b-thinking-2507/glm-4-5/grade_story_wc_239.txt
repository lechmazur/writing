<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Witness lacks embodied contradiction; motivation remains abstract ("unravel cosmic illusions") without concrete flaws or micro-choices under pressure. "Pure consciousness" epiphany violates "no unearned epiphanies" rule, reading as thematic echo rather than earned insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (dictionary glowing at peak hiccup) with felt cost (time running out), but orientation anchors who/where only at word 150 ("end of history witness paced..."), narrowly avoiding Orientation Test penalty. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase toward altar scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Resounding hush functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("unified into one resounding hush of completion"), constraining perception by eliminating air movement yet allowing dictionary flutter—a persistent constraint shaping the climax's impossibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (cosmic unification within hiccup) tighten via time pressure ("hiccup would not last"), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; witness reacts to cosmic forces rather than making trade-offs. Cost ("only opportunity") feels conceptual, not viscerally felt on the page until final unification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness resonates through the dictionary's "spaces between words" reprise at closure, avoiding moralizing. However, "threads of light older than time" leans toward symbolic convenience rather than earned complexity, slightly diluting the final image's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in lexicon ("wanderingly exact," "hiccup") and rhythm shifts during high-pressure beats ("Spiral arbitration intensified..."). No POV slippage; lyrical compression taught early ("resounding hush settled like dust") pays off cleanly in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears 3x in high-pressure beats with near-synonym churn ("meander without purpose," "paradox resolved"), triggering −0.3 loop penalty. Figurative density ("universe's hiccup") remains legible but edges toward overwriting in the altar sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes cosmic library trope with "softcover dictionary" specificity, transforming it into an active tool. Risk-taking (abstract witness, no dialogue) heightens stakes coherently, though "spiral arbitration" concept feels slightly derivative of Eastern philosophy without fresh inflection.</comment>
