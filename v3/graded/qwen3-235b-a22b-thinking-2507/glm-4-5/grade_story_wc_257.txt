<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands stilled by grief" versus current creation, but emotional progression lacks irrationality; grief transformation feels tidily resolved without messy contradictions during peak pressure beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "hands still carry weight... but learned to bloom," but Orientation Test fails: setting remains vague past 120 words ("timeless observatory" lacks spatial anchors), costing 0.3 deduction despite lyrical payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: vellum stencil constrains choices (guiding jewelry design), while origami coordinates charge the final image; sensory details like "soft warm glow" reflect urgency without tourist checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "withering to bloom" motif, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; pressure accumulates texturally yet misses meaningful on-page reversal where Elena confronts her grief actively rather than maintaining ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through phoenix motif and origami coordinates, but final paragraph's "proving that even the most withered souls..." veers toward thematic echo, reducing earned resonance with near-moralizing language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "curtains of intention shimmering," rhythmic control under pressure flawless; no head-hopping, though "subdued ardor" repetition risks voice convergence during emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "folded origami figures—cranes, butterflies, flowers" demonstrates syntactic variety. Minor deduction for "genuinely artificial" (9D), a label-only trait disrupting lexicon consistency in craft description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms mourning trope through observatory's "curtains of intention" mechanic; specific vellum stencil detail avoids generality. Derivative premise guardrail applies: "timeless observatory" concept lacks fresh inflection beyond standard liminal-space tropes.</comment>
