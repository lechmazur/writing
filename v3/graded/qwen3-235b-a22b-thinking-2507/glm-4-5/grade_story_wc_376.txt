<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "leaving behind falsehoods" with embodied cost; wilting trait drives concrete tradeoffs without diagnostic labels. Contradictory impulses (truth vs. connection) act simultaneously in final preparation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "leaving behind falsehoods" forecloses social survival with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in map/plate alignment, reweighting dominant stake via candor mechanics. Cost legible in abandonment of tolerated lies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zinc plate constrains choice—glowing alignment creates path—and charges final image as "keys to restored truth." Body (wilting) and tools (calligraphy gold) directly shape tactics in toxic air. Sensory details filtered through botanical profession avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: map/plate alignment reconfigures path options under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in "leaving behind falsehoods," altering tactics by requiring truth in each breath. Single meaningful deepening (candor as passage) forecloses deception-based survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "candor in small moments" reweights journey as the path itself. Final image recharges "lost conversations" as "restored truth" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; insight earned via map’s candor markers and liquid gold mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices zinc warmth, oilcloth textures, professional priority on postal codes. Rhythmic control under pressure in "conversations that vanished with the oasis, with her love..." No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional during realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid gold that cured when truths spoken" does triple duty (character/world/theme). Final line recharges motifs with precision. No figurative muddle—sensory specificity replaces abstraction ("oilcloth and twine," "toxic sky’s uncertain light").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: calligrapher’s truth-curing craft transforms "lost conversations" trope. Emotional specificity in unsaid words with departed love avoids generic dystopia. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise passes transformation test.</comment>
