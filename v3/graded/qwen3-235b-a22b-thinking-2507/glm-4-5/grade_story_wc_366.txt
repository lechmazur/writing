<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "luminescent ache" embodying loneliness/kinship; micro-choices like recreating the stone stack reveal values under pressure. Slight underdevelopment of vanished keeper's influence as motivation anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "no longer a burden but a reminder" crystallizes cost with the sea glass return. Accumulative lens holds as discoveries narrow options toward stance crystallization; lamp repair feels slightly convenient but doesn't break texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lantern room's vibration constrains stone stacking—a physical detail that charges the final image. Sea glass and oil smells aren't decorative; they actively shape discovery and the vial's emotional container. Micro-setting drives the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through layered discoveries: the letter chain's "purpose to protect this connection" forces Elias's choice to join. Escalation is pure Accumulative—each folded paper deepens the cost until his stone placement forecloses solitude with visible emotional trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment>Theme emerges organically: "stones stacked just right could tell stories deeper than words" reweights the premise without moralizing. The vial of seawater embodies earned wisdom about emotional shelter, avoiding abstraction through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "smell of... pause between thunderclaps" filters setting through Elias's observational lens. Minor register drift in "luminescent ache" risks abstraction but is saved by the seawater vial's physicality during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "jade green sea glass" and "vibration despite tower's constant hum" showcase textural specificity. Final line's cadence ("lighting the way for those who followed") propels closure without overwriting—every phrase charges the stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes through stone stacks as silent communication. The sea glass as "marker" feels inevitable in hindsight, synthesizing loneliness and legacy with emotional specificity no generic container could match.</comment>
