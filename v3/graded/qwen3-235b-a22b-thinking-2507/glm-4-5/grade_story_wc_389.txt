<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in scientific patience overcomes abstract "variant allegiance" labeling, but micro-choices lack visible cost escalation; isolation is backdrop not active crucible during pivotal prophet-revelation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes his translator role with conceptual cost of perpetual isolation; accumulative lens holds through prophet's rise mirroring transmissions, though causality leans observational rather than agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico constrains all action—light capture, pattern tracing, final humming secrets—and charges closure image; stormlit observatory’s atmospheric constraints directly enable the core transmission mechanic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scientific vs. divine prophecy ownership) tightens through prophet’s rise, but Elias’ passive observation weakens agency; cost of isolation feels earned yet lacks visceral escalation beyond gradual documentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image—"lonely visionary smiled... knowing variant allegiance had been the key"—resonantly answers "who owns truth?" without moralizing; theme emerges organically from portico’s light patterns versus prophet’s performative lightning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ozone-stained fingertips" and frequency-based noticing; lyrical precision sustains under pressure though repetitive "Elias [verb]" stems slightly dilute rhythmic control in mid-section.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in adjacent "Elias spent... Elias traced..." sentences creates minor scaffold loop; overwrought metaphors ("ancient shadows he harnessed") occasionally blur immediacy despite otherwise vivid propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of electromagnetic archaeology and prophecy transforms "lonely visionary" trope; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes through prophet’s mirror-image rise without gimmickry.</comment>
