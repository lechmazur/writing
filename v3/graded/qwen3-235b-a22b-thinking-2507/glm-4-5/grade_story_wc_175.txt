<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (attaching moth wing despite uncertainty), but "esoteric realist" label lacks sufficient dramatization in peak beats to reach 9.0. Motivation crystallizes through embodied ritual, though one contradictory impulse in climax would elevate further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "tonight... patterns would be honored" against "day would come when no one would remember." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; cost legible in the dissolution of signals against enduring heartbeat rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant grotto functions as active constraint: cloudlight enables moth wing's iridescence, moss/orchids supply moon-flower silk. Final image charges closure as temporary signals "dissolve by dawn," embodying the transience theme with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through knot-tying ritual, culminating in monarch's acknowledgment. Conceptual cost—remembering without preservation—is unmistakable, though escalation could tighten the causal link between the wing attachment and the butterfly's response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: knotted structures reweight "interrupted cadence" from ecological loss to cosmic rhythm. Final image—"woven a temporary structure... patterns would be honored"—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cloud-touched trees," "blushing stillness") modulates effectively with pressure. Rhythmic control falters slightly in transition to nightfall with near-repetition of "blushing stillness," preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-loop in "transiently rooted" (first 70 words) and verbatim "blushing stillness" repetition slightly dilute propulsion. Otherwise exemplary density—e.g., "knots representing generations lost" does triple duty—but artifacts prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms eco-grief through tactile ritual (moon-flower silk signals) and fresh angle: remembrance as dialogue with the lost. Emotional specificity in "brief alignment with cosmic forces" avoids abstraction, though one more irreversible choice would heighten stakes.</comment>
