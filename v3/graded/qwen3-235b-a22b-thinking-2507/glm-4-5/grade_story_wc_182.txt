<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation (rescuing mentor's colleague) and micro-choices (diary as sacred text during negotiation) reveal values under pressure. Lacks deeper internal contradiction beyond professional drive; flaws don't compound choices despite "carefully resourceful" trait being actionably demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("weight of countless unlearned lessons shifting") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by paragraph 1, but cost legibility slightly diffuse; "cosmic order of knowledge" shift needs tighter anchoring to Elara's physical experience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Botanical diary functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (glowing with heartbeat rhythm, tender closure). Labyrinthine bookstore pressures choices through guardian negotiation, though mountain scale remains atmospheric rather than tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly through guardian renegotiation ("access points you deliberately omitted"), but escalation feels slightly convenient—guardians yield rapidly without meaningful resistance escalation. Cost is conceptual yet legible in the "shifting" knowledge balance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "gaps as opportunities" reweighted by final image of diary returned and symphony "waiting for those who listen." Avoids moralizing; "Some lessons can only be learned through rescue missions" feels earned through action, not thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("books whispered their contents," "garden of ink and paper") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "mercurial library spaces" slightly disrupts scholarly voice, but "unheard symphony" motif sustains coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, though "carefully resourceful" label repetition and "mercurial library spaces" overwriting slightly dull closure propulsion. No fatal loops, but final paragraph's "forever changing and yet always waiting" risks sentimentality without concrete anchoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical/textual fusion transforms library tropes. Emotional truth in scholar's motivation avoids abstraction; "unlearned lessons as prisons" premise followed through with conceptual rigor. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
