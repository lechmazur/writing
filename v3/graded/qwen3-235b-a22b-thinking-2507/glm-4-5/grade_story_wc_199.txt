<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete micro-choices (prodding seed pod, monument-building), but transformation trait lacks visible trade-offs; "mossy delight" borders on label-only feeling despite strong embodied emotion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (permanent transformation cycle), but "cost proof" is vague—tingling skin lacks tangible forfeiture; moonstone deepening suffices for scope though lens ambiguity risks 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ashen arbor constrains choices via seasonal "hush" pressure and seed-sorting tools; recurring moonstone monument charges final image, though "mossy platform" overuse edges toward white-room syndrome in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via moonstone’s appearance raising prophecy urgency, but conflict remains procedural—no live option foreclosure; "warning of changing winds" lacks visceral consequence, capping escalation below 8.8 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "becoming and unbecoming" cycle, but final paragraph’s explicit "familiar cycle" statement risks moralizing; avoids sentimentality yet overstates wisdom where concrete particulars (e.g., ironwood seeds) should resonate alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chlorophyll-stained fingers," "bone tool") persists under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure, though "mossy delight" repetition weakens rhythmic control in climax beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("transformed after each hush"/"emerges transformed always") and "mossy delight" thematic echo dull closure beat; otherwise strong density, but final-third artifacts disallow 9+ per text-artifact guard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-sorting as prophecy decoding avoids folklore tropes; "monuments to forgotten things" elevates beyond template, though transformation motif lacks sufficient risk-taking to breach 8.8 without Q2/Q7 support.</comment>
