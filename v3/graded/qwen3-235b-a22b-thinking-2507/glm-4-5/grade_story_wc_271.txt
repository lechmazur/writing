<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "love and loss existed not as opposites but as truths that could coexist," but somatic markers verge on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied degradation under peak stress during the anniversary beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with Maya's frozen posture after releasing the photo, making the cost of coexistence legible through physical stillness; lighthouse keeper detail creates minor orientation debt but serves atmospheric context without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seaside cliff and arboretum function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the churning sea below mirrors internal turbulence while the cliff's edge physically constrains Maya's release of the photograph, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Maya's anniversary ritual where somatic markers escalate tension, but the lighthouse keeper departure lacks causal linkage to the dominant stake of grief management, slightly diluting pressure coherence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the oyster shell metaphor evolving into "pearl of stillness," with the final line reframing pain as optimism's anchor avoiding moralizing; however, "to anchor optimism in realism" risks thematic echo when repeated verbatim.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "coax life from fragile cuttings" and rhythmic control during crisis beats ("clenched jaw," "shallow breathing") showcase voice mastery; no head-hopping in single-POV lyric compression taught early through botanical focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "methodically folding the image away" followed by "moving among the plants" creates slight momentum drag; otherwise exceptional density with concrete verbs like "graft" and "nurture" avoiding overwriting in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through horticultural metaphor feels inevitable, with the arboretum's "perpetual rebirth" mirroring Maya's journey; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
