<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "learned from mistakes" is summary, not embodied struggle. Micro-choices like quill hovering show values, but no genuine flaw complicates her final action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the map’s completion crystallizes options with visible cost ("constant vigilance"). Accumulative lens holds as ice cracks and data visualization tighten pressure toward the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and kingfisher quill charge the final image—quill illuminates the map, spire "converged in this moment." Sensory details like "cracks forming" constrain choice by validating predictions, avoiding generic symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: predictive models narrow options to westward migration. Cost ("constant vigilance") is legible in the final line, though the tightening lacks a felt trade-off beyond abstract endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ignorance cartography" as concrete action, but final line’s explicit "transformation was an ongoing process" borders on thematic echo, undermining earned resonance with near-prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "charting what was yet to be discovered" lexicon; rhythm modulates from lyrical ("suspended before the pen") to urgent ("time... limited"). No head-hopping; compression taught early via predictive modeling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" appears twice as label-only trait, creating synonym churn. Otherwise strong propulsion—ink flowing parallels transformative information—but redundant phrasing ("sustaining transformation") dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ignorance cartographer" and predictive modeling avoids tropes, but "kingfisher feather" feels derivative. Emotional specificity in "errors refining methods" elevates; constraint-driven innovation deepens premise without gimmickry.</comment>
