<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") and embodied emotion (handling cloth with reverence) powerfully drive Marcus's closure choice; micro-choice sealing the scrap reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in final line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: final image of sealing the scrap crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("something besides shame"); orientation anchors within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry setting actively constrains choice and charges closure—the "growing hole" directly mirrors Marcus's emotional void, making the final glimmer of purpose resonate through environmental contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when foreman questions value, forcing Marcus to articulate emotional worth; cost is legible in the shift from "hollowed out" resignation to "glimmer of passion" with visible emotional trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of sealing the scrap offers resonant non-literal answer to purpose-after-loss; avoids moralizing by charging "echo valley" with concrete action rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thread count 120 per inch") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates perfectly from resignation to quiet revelation without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "hollowed out like the abandoned quarry" slightly dulls closure impact; otherwise high density and propulsion, but "echo valley longing" in dialogue borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quarry setting with amplifier cloth transforms "after the applause" trope; specific verifiable detail (Marshall aluminum threads) grounds emotional truth without quirkiness.</comment>
