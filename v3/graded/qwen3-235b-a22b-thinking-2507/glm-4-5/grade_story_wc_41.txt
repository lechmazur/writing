<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in his fight to retain the fading sound ("clung to echoes") while his nature demands forgetting; micro-choice of adding the final spiral reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost as the sound vanishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the sound fades as he opens his eyes to solitude, making the cost of ephemeral connection legible through the caretaker's absence and his quiet turn toward home under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog isn't backdrop but constraint—it necessitates driftwood markers and obscures the arch until the chalk drawing; the worn chalk piece physically charges the final image as he begins arranging markers for home.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: the quest shifts from vague longing to tactile action (drawing on arch), narrowing options to one decisive choice (final spiral) with felt cost in immediate loss of the sound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the arch's hum—a non-literal answer to "growing older" that reweights the prophet's lifelong search without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality via the sound's inevitable fade.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("fog sculpture garden," "thousand sighs layered"); rhythmic control tightens under pressure ("faint at first, like hearing through water") with no head-hopping despite the caretaker's brief appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "condensation" on the arch enables chalk adhesion, demonstrating textural specificity, though "tidal longing" slightly risks abstract phrasing before earning concreteness through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms aging tropes through the sonic lens and precognitive forgetfulness; the chalk-drawn arch as resonant vessel feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (sound as climax) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
