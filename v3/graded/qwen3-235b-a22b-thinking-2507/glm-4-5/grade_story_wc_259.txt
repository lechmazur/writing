<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "anguished joy" repeats as label rather than embodied conflict. No micro-choices reveal value hierarchy—persistence lacks genuine struggle between impulses. Diagnostic phrasing ("familiar mixture of anguish and joy") triggers -0.5 penalty in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost ("forever changed"), but cost proof fails—no concrete image shows transformation cost beyond abstract "tears." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet "systematic forgetting" backstory exceeds BRR limits, dulling present-frame pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda constrains choice (patternless touch) and charges final image ("glowing with inner light"). Archive setting remains generic "labyrinth," missing tactical pressure. Micro-setting (saffron-veil) lacks causal role—sensory detail vivid but doesn't alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (accessing memories) tighten via density increase as particles coalesce, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "steadily unpredictable" atoms drive change, not Elara's choices. Cost ("forever changed") feels abstract; no visible price alters tactics beyond emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "end of innocence" motif reweighted by final line ("beginning of understanding"). Avoids moralizing, but "anguished joy" over-telling risks thematic echo; final image’s "perfect convergence" edges toward pseudo-profundity without concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fabric catching dim light like captured sunset") modulates with twilight. But "diagnostic label-speak" ("anguished joy" x3) violates embodied emotion under stress. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she watched") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose flows with rhythmic control ("twilight deepened, casting long shadows"), but paraphrase loops ("steadily unpredictable" repeated without pressure) and therapy-speak ("perfect convergence of anguish and joy") trigger -0.4 penalty. Final beat’s figurative muddle obscures cost legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden knowledge" trope via specific method (avoiding patterns), with emotional truth in merging consciousness. Risks derivative premise but saved by saffron-veil historian’s fresh occupational lens. Avoids middle-ground with bold Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
