<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s shift from cataloging duty to personal mission; embodied "luminous regret" avoids label-speak as the shadow dissolves into moonlight, making the cost visceral without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "luminous regret" crystallizes when the shadow reveals her friend, transforming her mission with felt stakes; Accumulative lens holds through shadow observations narrowing to the river stone’s warmth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The river stone evolves from grounding tool to "bridge between moments," actively constraining choices (e.g., tightening grip during revelation) and charging the final image where it absorbs "lingering light" of metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s accumulation of shadow sketches, culminating in the unbound shadow’s approach; cost is unmistakable in "understanding too late," reweighting her mission with conceptual price paid in luminous regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the river stone’s transformation embodies love’s persistence beyond death, avoiding moralizing; final image ("witness to love’s endurance") resonates as earned answer to the central question of connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature as "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" filters all observations; rhythmic control deepens under pressure (e.g., fragmented "ancient and knowing" phrasing during shadow’s approach), with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; high density where "petal-soft leaves" and "cool, smooth" stone advance atmosphere and character; sentence rhythms vary organically (e.g., lyrical "dissolved, not disappearing" cadence during climax) with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of shadow-as-lost-love avoids afterlife clichés through specific constraints (library’s "shadow unbound" rules); risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without sacrificing clarity in the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
