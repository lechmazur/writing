<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (grounded craft vs. reaching for dreams); final renunciation of capture earns closure with visible cost ("thirty years studying" transformed into recreating freedom). No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion in tremor, breathing, and chest movements under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: sextant now points to shifting positions, revealing starlight fruits with conceptual cost (boundaries erased, purpose redefined). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (fog pulsing, breathing synchronizing) with cost legible in "firmly grounded in his purpose" after transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ruined orchard and sextant function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge closure—fog parts to reveal starlight fruits, while the sextant's transformation directly enables the final image. Sensory details (quartz catching light, crystallizing mist) serve urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: synchronized breathing deepens pressure, reweighting stakes from repair to transformation. Cost is unmistakable—"thirty years studying" culminates in altered purpose (recreating freedom vs. capture), with moral calculus between control and liberation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (merging shards with intention, not glue) and final image (starlight fruits). Avoids moralizing; "windows showing possibilities" resonates as non-literal answer to "erasing boundaries," with conceptual cost in the dream's settled freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices quartz "like glass mountains," textures of fog and brass. Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from measured repair ("polishing, aligning, honing") to crystallized closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("mirror shattered like a failed constellation" compresses backstory). Final line avoids overwriting while charging closure. Minor scaffolding in "evening had begun to creep" (−0.2) but no closure artifacts; figurative language clarifies stakes throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craft metaphysics: "repair with intention, not glue" transforms trope through specific logic. Emotional truth in renouncing capture for recreation; "glass mountains" avoids quirkiness by charging final image with conceptual weight.</comment>
