<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines through weathered hands and hesitant song, but backstory about abandonment exceeds BRR limits with tell-not-show reflection lacking micro-choice anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (halo dissolution), though the "wrong turn" transition leans slightly on coincidence rather than earned accumulation under the dominant lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: wind bells constrain singing choice and charge the final image, with misting hush functioning as tactile environment that evolves from passive atmosphere to active guide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten beautifully around interpreting silence, but escalation relies too heavily on the halo's magic rather than carpenter's agency during the pivotal corridor transition under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "misting hush" evolving from silence to symphony; final wind bell reweights "silence as potential" without moralizing, though "whispering gleam" repetition risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("weathered hands," "tentative note"), but "whispering gleam" recurs identically in opening/closing, creating forced motif rather than organic evolution under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though "misting hush" repetition in key beats crosses into scaffold territory; final dissolution image avoids Q7 artifact caps by maintaining crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms abandoned circus trope through sensory alchemy, but "halo fragment" feels derivative without sufficient fresh inflection beyond emotional authenticity in the carpenter's rebirth.</comment>
