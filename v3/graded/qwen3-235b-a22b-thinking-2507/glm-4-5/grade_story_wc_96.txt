<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete objects (coffee tin, seeds) shows contradictory impulses; fragmented memories lack visible tradeoffs during rebuilding, weakening causality of molts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("broken things hold light"), but moon progression fails to tighten tactics as a live clock under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rusted library constrains movement ("dancing between mangled metal"), but micro-setting potential of coffee tin isn't leveraged to alter choices beyond symbolic scattering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knowledge) deepens through reflection, but pressure lacks tangible escalation; resistance "blooming" remains thematic rather than testing commitment with new complications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" motif reweights meaning at closure without moralizing; "forge beauty from anarchy" avoids thematic echo by being embodied in seed-scattering action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid perceptual signature ("molted personalities like Phoenix feathers"), but prison backstory exceeds BRR limits with two reflective blocks lacking micro-choice anchors that alter present tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with lyrical propulsion, but "luminous fracture" repetition creates paraphrase loops; "cerebral cathedral" metaphor clashes with concrete botanical imagery in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of resistance as botanical persistence, though vagrant poet archetype risks familiarity; coffee tin's seed reveal transforms expected contraband trope with earned specificity.</comment>
