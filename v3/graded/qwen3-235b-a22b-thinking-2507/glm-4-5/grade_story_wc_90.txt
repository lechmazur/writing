<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; pacifism is stated but never tested by tangible temptation. "Tears streamed" is label-only emotion without specific embodiment. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond abstract "weight of history."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with ship dissolution as cost, but escalation lacks felt pressure: no near-miss stitch consequence despite stated risk. Cost proof test fails—"weight of all human history" remains abstract, not dramatized during pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recycled ship functions as micro-setting: groans during transcendence constrain action and charge final image. "Faint shimmer of dried tears" provides tactile specificity that reweights closure. Avoids white-room syndrome through debris-field origins.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("one wrong stitch could collapse bridge") signaled early but escalation lacks visceral cost. No tactical trade-off during stitching; "hands steady" undermines tension. Ship dissolution as cost feels earned but not unmistakable on-page during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "tears streaming... mirroring ancient sorrow" avoids moralizing. Final image ("recycled vessel delivering love") reweights premise non-literally with conceptual cost. No thematic echo despite high philosophical stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "quantum energies pulsed around temporal rift" filtered through meditative focus. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("hands steady despite weight..."). Minor slip: "ghostly resolve written on every line" is telling, not showing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop: "gravitationally lighter when happy" stated twice within three lines. Final line ("recycled vessel delivering love") achieves crystalline propulsion. No closure artifacts, but scaffold slightly dulls mid-beat immediacy during stitching sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: compassion as gravitational physics, pacifism as technical skill. Emotional truth in "tears creating new paths on skin" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (dimension-stitching via sorrow) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
