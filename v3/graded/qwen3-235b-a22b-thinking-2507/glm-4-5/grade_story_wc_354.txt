<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in contradictory impulses (redemption vs. beauty-seeking) and embodied micro-choices with the worry stone; minor thematic echo in final paragraph slightly undermines earned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost (exile transformed to enlightenment), but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient pattern-break intensity in the final beat to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Worry stone functions as essential micro-setting charging the finale, yet the magnetic nexus remains atmospheric rather than concretely constraining choices despite vivid sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Three-day deadline meaningfully tightens tactics under Accumulative pressure, but the cost of realization ("freedom to see beyond dogma") feels slightly abstract versus tangible forfeiture required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through chess/silence motifs, but the final line's direct "silence contains more truth" risks thematic echo, diluting the earned resonance of the charged-poise closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (chess-master pattern recognition) sustains voice under pressure, though minor register drift in "method of translating silence" momentarily distances the focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity marred by two paraphrase loops ("thoughtfully precise" repetition) and one template cadence ("He closed... He had... He was...") dulling high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess mastery with natural forces avoids tropes through specific stakes, but the "beauty in exile" resolution edges toward familiar emotional templates without sufficient risk-taking.</comment>
