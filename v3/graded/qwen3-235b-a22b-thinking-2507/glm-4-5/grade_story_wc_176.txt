<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("guilt" vs "snowmelt ardor") lacks simultaneous tension during rope work; embodied emotion strong but micro-choices under pressure lack layered value hierarchy at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (keeper role acceptance) lands with visible cost (frozen tears, work just beginning), but backstory reflection slightly over-summarizes without altering present tactics mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum actively constrains action (frigid air requiring "technically gentle" hands) and charges closure (names "etched in ice"); aurora's movement directly triggers pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("preserve names") clear early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven obstacle during rope reconfiguration; no snapped thread or misaligned braid to overcome, missing agency-driven tightening under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing, but "chosen preservation instead" edges toward thematic echo; resonance emerges through rope's light-crystallized names without stated moral, though secondary stake ("forgiveness") underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wax caster fingers," "lantern casting dancing shadows") with rhythmic control; purposeful compression taught early via organ card's "only surviving fragment" payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" slightly overwrought in high-pressure beat; "time stretching around her like the rope" risks mixed metaphor but doesn't obscure closure. Zero loops, strong propulsion through rope work sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wax casting precision with memory preservation; "technically gentle" transforms trope into specific constraint. Avoids safety middle via bold conceptual repricing of street organ card.</comment>
