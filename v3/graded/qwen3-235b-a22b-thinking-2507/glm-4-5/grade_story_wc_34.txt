<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "driftingly alert" trait lacks embodied trade-offs during encoding attempts. Childhood silence backstory anchors motivation but doesn't create conflicting impulses in the courtyard scene. Closure shows credible endurance yet misses visceral cost in the final harmony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Situational) holds through closure. Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mutual articulation), but felt stakes remain abstract. Critical flaw: no narrowing of options during the encoding process—ghost communication resolves too easily without tactical escalation under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Misty courtyard's atmospheric specificity dazzles but functions as postcard backdrop rather than active constraint. Flower press bolt plate qualifies as micro-setting—it charges the final image through botanical/mathematical etching—but never pressures Elara's choices during high-stakes encoding attempts. Cap enforced per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs) signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. Ghost's loneliness remains static; no narrowing of options when encoding fails. "Between lightning and thunder" timeframe tightens decisions but isn't leveraged for cost (e.g., missed flashes causing communication loss). Resolution feels earned yet abstract—no visible price paid beyond emotional catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through graffiti palimpsests and digital/physical translation. Final image ("silent song continued to play") offers resonant non-literal answer to "unspoken needs" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but risks sentimentality in "symphony of interconnected expression"—nearly crosses into abstraction without concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in glitch interpretation ("patterns forming words only she could understand"). Voice modulates beautifully with storm intensity but lacks pressure-driven compression during encoding attempts—lyrical density persists when stress should simplify syntax. No head-hopping; "driftingly alert" state maintained with consistent focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft elevated but suffers from minor scaffolding: "time stretches like taffy" followed by "suspended moment" creates subtle synonym loop. Overwritten moments ("tinkersong wonder that echoed through digital ether") dilute momentum in low-pressure beats. Final line ("silent song continued to play") achieves crystalline propulsion without artifice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital loneliness and analog preservation—flower press plate transforms clichéd "ghost in machine" trope through botanical-mathematical specificity. Commits fully to premise without retreat, avoiding middle-ground hedging. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes coherently; "graffiti palimpsests" reconfigure AI communication in emotionally specific ways.</comment>
