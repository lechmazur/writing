<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (isolation vs. needing subjects) drive choices; embodied emotion in Thomas’s borrowed panic ("thoughts feeling foreign") avoids label-speak. Thomas lacks depth as a mere data point, thinning relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Elara’s renewed data collection amid vanishing stars crystallizes her ethical cost ("deliberate invasion of empathy"). Accumulative lens holds via star-counting pattern, but the third star vanishing feels redundant for tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz workshop functions as micro-setting—its shifting shadows actively disorient Thomas, altering tactics. Final image of fragment in protective case charges closure by reweighting her quest’s sterility against dawn’s light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (quantifying emotion) tighten through Thomas’s disorientation, narrowing Elara’s path to unethical methods. Cost is legible in her isolation and "calculated disruption," but internal conflict lacks deeper testing beyond her stated resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (recording data, storing the fragment), not abstraction. Final line’s "patterns as orderly as the stars" risks thematic echo but is salvaged by its integration with her flawed certainty in the closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: printing terms ("lead type pieces") and math metaphors filter all observation. Rhythmic control peaks in Thomas’s panic ("mouth forming words she had just spoken"), though "deliberate ambiguity" feels slightly generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "topaz-laden walls shimmered with an otherworldly luminescence" edges toward purple prose. Final paragraph’s lyrical compression ("cracked open like a code") avoids overwriting, preserving propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printing craft and emotion-as-math avoids trope pitfalls. Ethical ambiguity ("unethical to others") grounds the premise, though vanishing stars borrow cosmic horror tropes without transformative specificity.</comment>
