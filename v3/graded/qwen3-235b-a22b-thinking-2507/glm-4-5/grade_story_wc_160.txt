<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (tremors shifting from anxiety to certainty) shows embodied emotion, but "encrypted compassion" epiphany lacks struggle; emotional shift from "tremors through her hands" to immediate certainty feels unearned without visible cost to prior anxiety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with folded sketches embodying "encrypted compassion," but adhesive analysis resolving conflict via coincidence ("trace elements matching botanical preserve") violates Accumulative/Textural lens where pressure must deepen through protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcano's breathing rhythm actively constrains choices (light patches guide measurements, stone tiers affect movement); antique chain functions as micro-setting when dropped to examine floor patterns, directly altering tactics and charging final image as talisman.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonizing flood/preservation) signaled early, but escalation falters—envelope discovery instantly provides solution without meaningful tightening; no visible price paid that charges final image under Accumulative lens beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (chain as "divining rod," folded sketches) avoiding moralizing; final line "sustainable future" ties to floodgate mechanics rather than abstraction, offering resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("dappled resolve," "moss-covered stone") but tense shifts ("she pictured a future" vs "water might flow") create inconsistent psychic distance during high-pressure discovery beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density ("slyly heartfelt message disguised as technical specifications" does triple duty) but paraphrase loop: "fingers trembled as she measured angles" followed by "tremors through her hands" three lines later dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms engineering tropes through volcanic setting and "encrypted compassion" concept, but "breathing amphitheater" echoes established literary motifs without sufficient transformation; adhesive analysis method feels fresh yet proximity to Koh's Mothertongue triggers -0.3.</comment>
