<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("arrogant man" vs "lines of penance") embodied through micro-choices like thread restoration representing memory reframing. Prince's silent presence forces earned self-forgiveness without artificial moral balance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with sensory density tightening toward Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallized in "fierce repose" and "thunder... like applause" reconfiguring time's meaning without physical action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (decoding mechanics) and charges final image ("door began to form"). "Woven hush" evolves from suffocating blanket to catalyst for the bell's sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through thunder's countdown ("two minutes remained"), narrowing options under Accumulative pressure. Cost legible in "fierce repose" and "lines of penance" as tangible manifestations of earned self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thread-decoding metaphor without abstraction. Final image ("thunder... like applause") reweights redemption as self-forgiveness, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "tutor's eyes for pattern and strategy" shaping sensory selection. Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter sentences as thunder approaches) with purposeful "woven hush" repetition teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "methodical work of decoding, gently separating each thread" exemplifies high-density propulsion. No figurative muddle in peak beats—final line crystallizes theme without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through chess tutor's specific lens (threads as strategic reframing). Risk-taking in quiet closure where thunder's "applause" reweights time without physical action, avoiding middle-ground hedging.</comment>
