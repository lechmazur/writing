<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority but lacks contradictory impulses; "notably receptive" trait remains label-only without constraining action. Epiphany feels unearned as commercial pressures never test her commitment, missing micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis works, but cost remains abstract ("deep commitment") with no visible price paid on the page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet pressure never tightens options—seed merely confirms existing philosophy without forcing adaptation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moonshadow Brook’s "flow" motif beautifully mirrors internal state but never constrains choices; corpse flower container (planted at dawn) functions as micro-setting but arrives too late to charge closure. Sensory details vivid yet ornamental, missing 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) declared but never tested—zero opposition or trade-offs. "Storm-born silence" sets mood but no live clock tightens decisions; escalation is passive reflection, not agency-driven deepening under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through corpse flower metaphor, with final image ("tending to puzzles and possibilities") offering resonant non-literal answer. Penalized for near-thematic echo: "innovation flows not through predictable channels" risks moralizing in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("notably receptive mind" noticing patterns) and rhythmic control shine, but "storm-born silence" repetition feels templated. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, avoiding register drift under reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No closure-dulling artifacts; prose lush but avoids overwriting traps. Minor scaffold: "Here, in this moment suspended between storm and stillness" redundantly echoes prior storm description, costing 0.2 under Text Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Corpse flower as creativity metaphor transforms trope through specific botanical stakes. Emotional truth in valuing slow growth feels fresh, but "escape room proprietor" premise leans on familiar artist-struggles template without sufficient risk-taking.</comment>
