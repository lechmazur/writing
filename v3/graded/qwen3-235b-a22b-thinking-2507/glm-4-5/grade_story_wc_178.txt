<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Anu’s contradictory impulses (empiricist vs. mystic) act simultaneously through frugal resource conservation as devotion; final covenant choice earned by 7 years of observation with visible cost in "become one with them." Slight deduction for internal conflict resolving cleanly without enduring tension in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: Anu’s mortal identity transformed ("become one with stars") while drums announce Nebuchadnezzar, crystallizing the Accumulative lens through sensory density (candle flicker, honey-like dato). Orientation clear by line 3; lens consistent through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (clay shards, ink conservation) constrains choices and charges closure via glowing symbols on palms; tile’s physicality (cool surface, unfolding) directly enables transcendent climax. Meets 9+ gate by transforming tools into thematic conduits without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Anu’s agency: equinox timing + Nebuchadnezzar’s approach force ritual, with cost legible in identity dissolution ("never imagining he would become one with them"). Tightening via candle flicker crystallizes stance, but secondary pressure (regime change) slightly overshadows internal conflict’s payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "encrypted devotion" as math-as-prayer, tile unfolding as divine mathematics. Final image (glowing symbols amid drums) reweights "dusky harmony" into earned transcendence without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "empirically ironic" repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomer’s light-focused diction ("amethyst and indigo," "dusky harmony") modulates rhythm under pressure. Slight deduction for "through无数次 calculations" breaking lexicon; otherwise, syntactic control elevates ritual tension without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with minor redundancy: "dusky harmony" reused verbatim without deepening, and "empirically ironic" approaches synonym churn. Propulsion strong in climax ("tile lifted silently"), but scaffold weakens final paragraphs’ momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy and mysticism via frugality-as-devotion; tile unfolding as "mathematics so perfect" transforms trope into emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes (regime change as cosmic threshold) while maintaining coherence through observational rigor.</comment>
