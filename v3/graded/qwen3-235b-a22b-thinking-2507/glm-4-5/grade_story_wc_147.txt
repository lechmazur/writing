<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (training vs instinct) drive micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion via memory-triggering liquid avoids labels. Slight motivation convenience in instantly grasping vial's mechanism prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("burning lungs," "crushing finality") under Accumulative lens. Final image crystallizes transformed understanding of time with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (oxygen gauge, crystal vial) constrains choices and charges closure; "lonesome splendor" evolves from atmosphere to tangible energy. Mineral-rich water details reflect professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Live clock (oxygen alarm) tightens tactics meaningfully; cost escalates from abstract risk to visceral lung burn. Agency through overriding instinct forecloses survival path with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial's transformation from perfume container to time-capturing device. Final image of planning return offers resonant answer to ephemeral/permanent tension without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct marine-scientist perceptual signature ("mineral-rich water preserved carvings"); rhythm accelerates during crisis. Minor register drift in "ephemeral harnessed" phrase prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Two paraphrase loops ("crushing pressure... passing centuries" → "crushing finality") and one template cadence run. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but scaffold prevents 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological thriller with lyrical time-capture; "gathered hush" as tangible force transforms trope. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates while honoring genre conventions.</comment>
