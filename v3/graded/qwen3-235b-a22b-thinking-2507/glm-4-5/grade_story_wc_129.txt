<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for belonging is concrete and intensifies through her reed-sculpting micro-choices, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in peak beats; "rootless yearning" remains abstract despite strong final dedication. Flaws feel authentic yet slightly under-dramatized during the tag discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: the sigil etching crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("luminescent ache" transforming to "radiant home"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory details until the final image reweights the crater's meaning under unbroken pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor and crater light function as micro-setting that constrains choices (reeds for pulleys) and charges the final image; "luminescent ache" evolves from sensory detail to emotional state. Every description serves urgency, like the sigil's "kurrajong seed pod" fusion mirroring kinship webs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven choices: Elara's proposal forms the search party, and the tag discovery forces redefinition of belonging. Cost is legible in the shift from "hollowness" to shared warmth, though the crater's physical danger could tighten options more viscerally during the descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sigil's reinterpretation—from street art to ancestral promise—reweighting "belonging" without moralizing. Final image ("webs of kinship... gleamed within the arbor’s heart") offers resonant, non-literal answer to isolation, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action (the etching).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("crystalline orchard perched at the shimmering crater’s edge"), with rhythmic control tightening during the descent. Minor register drift occurs in "obsessively patient artistry," but elision of backstory is taught early and paid off through the sigil’s revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose flows with high density ("spirals and arches from pliant stems"), but "webs of kinship" appears as label before embodiment, and "boldly sympathetic regard" verges on abstraction. No loops dull closure, though minor scaffold weakens the kinship motif’s integration in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "loner finds community" trope through crater-specific symbology (sigil as land’s promise) and fresh kinship metaphor. Emotional truth in Elara’s shift from "solitary reed-sculptor" to collective belonging feels inevitable, avoiding generic templates via the arbor’s volcanic heart etching.</comment>
