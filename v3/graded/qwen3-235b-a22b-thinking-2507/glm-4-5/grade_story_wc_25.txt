<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during climax; Marlo's flawless execution feels unearned despite established expertise. Flaws don't compound—Vance's suspicion lacks visceral cost like job insecurity. Interiority stays rational without irrational layering under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works (Vance's suspicion crystallizes communication stakes), but conceptual cost feels abstract. Missing tangible consequence—no specific image showing what Marlo risks losing. Storm resolution slightly eases pressure instead of heightening final stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as active micro-setting: their humming acoustics constrain choices and charge the final image. Zodiac coin's temperature shift (warm during storm/cool after) perfectly mirrors atmospheric pressure. Sensory details feel lived-in, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain professional rather than visceral—Vance's suspicion implies future conflict but lacks immediate cost (e.g., demotion threat). Escalation via storm intensity works, but Marlo's flawless success undercuts tension. Needs one concrete loss (e.g., dropped map during whisper).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: whispers vs shouts as communication philosophy reweighted by final coin image. Avoids moralizing, but Vance's curiosity lacks thematic weight—could deepen cost by showing Marlo's fear of being silenced. No forced resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Marlo's acoustic expertise shapes sensory filtering ("detecting Vance's footsteps"). Voice modulates beautifully under storm pressure. Minor register drift when describing "conceptual repricing" in thought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "geomagnetic storm intensified" rephrased identically three times in 70 words. Coin's "strange warmth" followed by "sensation that always preceded clarity" tells instead of shows. Final line lacks propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics and worker's craft avoids tropes. Zodiac maps transform from gimmick to thematic anchor. But safety-hedging in stakes—conflict stays intellectual rather than risking Marlo's livelihood—caps originality.</comment>
