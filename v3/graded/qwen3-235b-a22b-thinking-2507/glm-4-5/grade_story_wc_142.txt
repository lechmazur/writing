<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance manifests in contradictory impulses (e.g., clutching the chip while teaching youth), with the chip's return embodying earned change. Slight tell in "reluctant conductor" offsets otherwise concrete embodiment of stress through micro-choices like sleepless mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the returned foundation stone chip crystallizes Maya's renunciation of individual guidance for collective power. Causal lens holds cleanly through graffiti's encoded counterproposals, though corporate resolution leans slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip constrains pivotal choices (mapping resistance strategies) and charges the final image when returned—meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory specificity ("fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater") avoids tourist cataloging by filtering through Maya's orderly perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from chaotic carnival to nailed notice, with Maya's graffiti-driven flash mobs demonstrating agency under pressure. The partial victory's cost (surrendering the chip) feels earned, though corporate emissaries' defeat lacks granular tactical friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the "spiral inside a circle" symbol reweights cultural preservation without moralizing. Avoids final-paragraph preachiness by letting the encrypted murals embody resilience, though "water remembers" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Maya's pattern-recognition ("orderly intuitive mind"), with syntax tightening during high-pressure beats ("For three nights, Maya barely slept"). Minor register drift in "culture shock absorber" term slightly dilutes voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("splashed," "nailing"), but scaffold appears in early sequential "Maya adjusted... Maya paused... Maya clutched" phrasing. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line's "spiral inside a circle" delivers crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification tropes via encoded graffiti as survival blueprint—specific to Neptunia's floating logic. Risk-taking (art as resistance tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though privatization conflict remains familiar despite fresh execution.</comment>
