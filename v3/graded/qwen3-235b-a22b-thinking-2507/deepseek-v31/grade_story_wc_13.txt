<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (discovery vs. heritage loss) manifest physically through pendant-twing and crystallize in the climax choice; embodied emotion avoids label-speak with "silence that stung the ears" driving her quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "last link to the past" sacrifice crystallizes options as she grips the pendant; causal lens holds through "because/therefore" chain from cadence flaw to engine repair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pendant (micro-setting) constrains climax tactics and charges final image; canal system functions as pressure-laden transit but lacks tactical constraint beyond poetic navigation during the journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation falters when Warden's exposition ("harmony breaking") tells rather than shows rising stakes; dominant "echo survival" stake tightens via cadence flaw detection but lacks one tangible pressure beat before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "ghosts of moments past" reweights echoes as temporal artifacts; final image avoids moralizing while answering "echo birth" quest through sacrificial resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "acoustics over architecture" focus; rhythmic control shines in "cascading silence" opener but slightly uniform syntax during canal journey dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in opening ("gaze fixed... consumed by singular motivation"); "potential thrum" filter-verb stack in climax slightly dulls immediacy despite otherwise vivid textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echoes as "time's children" avoids trope clichés; emotional truth in sacrificing heritage for resonance elevates beyond surface novelty with specific temporal mechanics.</comment>
