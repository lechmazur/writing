<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elara abandons literal reconstruction for symbolic acceptance; embodied emotion via "fingertips brushing stone walls" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to clear shadow space earns closure through prior causality, though islanders' passive resistance slightly weakens pressure testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "an interruption could create a new path" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("her journey incomplete"). Causal lens holds perfectly—bronze discovery directly triggers epiphany. Cost proof is undeniable in "holding the heavy bronze, she understood her journey was also incomplete."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choices (delicate root excavation) and charges closure: "tree now told the time, roots intertwined." Micro-setting (sundial base) shapes tactics; sensory details like "air smelled of dust, dry leaves" filter through Elara’s reverence. Only minor deduction for generic "thyme" mention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore bloodline faith) tightens causally: bronze discovery forces knowledge shift, leading to epiphany. Agency drives every turn—her contemplation and clearing space narrow options with visible cost (abandoning original mission). Escalation perfectly fulfills 9+ test: cost is unmistakable in "wonderfully interrupted" redefinition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "interruption creates new paths" shown through tree-as-gnomon solution, never stated. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost—no moralizing, only resonant "roots forever intertwined." Subtext in "sun’s anchor" symbolism avoids thematic echo; earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct: "stone walls hummed with residual sun-warmth" reflects diaspora returnee’s tactile curiosity. Syntax modulates perfectly—lyrical for contemplation, crisp for action ("Then her trowel struck"). Zero filter verbs; emotional progression feels authentic as curiosity shifts to reverence. Minor deduction for "cautious enchantment" abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves crystalline propulsion: "spectacular, haunting fusion of life and death" does triple duty (setting/tone/theme). Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm naturally. Only microscopic flaw: "cautious enchantment" phrasing slightly abstract but redeemed by "thrilling discovery" later. Final line "wonderfully interrupted" recharges motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope via sundial solution—interruption becomes generative. Every detail serves conflict: "sun’s anchor" isn’t poetic but plot-critical. Avoids safety middle by making faith restoration about acceptance, not religion. Freshness passes transformation test: swap "sundial" for "urn," and emotional arc collapses.</comment>
