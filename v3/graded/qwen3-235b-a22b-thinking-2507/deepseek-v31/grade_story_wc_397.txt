<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied micro-choices (pocketing parasol tip, standing in snow) but lacks one visible flaw-driven mistake compounding pressure pre-climax. "Gripped reality too tightly" remains abstract without prior concrete misstep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: ice shelf crack crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (death wish foreclosed). Accumulative lens holds throughout—density peaks at blizzard with felt cost in "loose grip finally allowed truth in." Orientation anchors by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (parasol tip) constrains choice and charges final image—irreplaceable as talisman. Drift-ice marina evolves from metaphor to physical constraint during blizzard, altering tactics (waiting vs. hauling nets). Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear→seeking endings) escalates via snowbound stillness, narrowing options to pure listening. Cost—relinquishing death wish—is visible in final hand-opening. Agency in volunteering choice tightens pressure, though disaster relief mechanics could deepen tactics slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through parasol tip’s meaning shift (loss→transformation), not statement. Final image reweights "endings" as "continuous cascade" with undeniable conceptual cost—no moralizing. Avoids false balance; embraces complexity via wind’s "solacing hymn" as earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("drift-ice marina of the mind") sustains under pressure with rhythmic control ("deep, internal sigh... resonant crack"). Compression taught early ("chemical erasure") pays off in blizzard stillness. Zero POV leaks despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "mournful cries of gulls" to "wind’s solacing hymn" shows earned density. Minor figurative muddle in opening ("drift-ice marina of the mind") slightly obscures physical setting but resolves via later literal ice. Final line crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle on euthanasia via "listening for endings" avoids tropes. Specificity (lace parasol tip, ice shelf sound) transforms familiar premise. Emotional truth in "not a scream, but low frequency" elevates beyond surface novelty, though blizzard coincidence risks slight convenience.</comment>
