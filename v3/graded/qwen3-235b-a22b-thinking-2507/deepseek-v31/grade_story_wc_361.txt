<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silas’s jittery embodiment (“hands fluttered like trapped moths”) and contradictory impulses (anxiety vs. hope to “coax wonder”) drive his earned closure choice. Hermit’s abrupt panic slightly undermines secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Silas’s “profound calm” replacing jitters after activating the road, with visible cost (end of lonely routine). Accumulative lens holds via aurora’s intensifying pressure narrowing options to one decisive act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway constrains choices (razor’s-edge danger) and the pendant’s crystalline germination charges the final image. Sensory details (violet light, humming vibration) are selective and POV-filtered without checklist padding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (routine vs. wonder) tightens via pendant’s activation forcing Silas’s stance crystallization. Cost—loss of old life—is legible in “his work had just begun,” though escalation lacks a micro-choice during the vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through Silas’s journey: the final “star-lit path” reweights “coaxing wonder from routine” without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing, not stating, the cost of transformed responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“aurora blazed its most intense” reflecting Silas’s anxiety) with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the vision without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“crystalline structures that grew at an impossible rate”) propels momentum. Slight overwriting in “silent, shimmering dance” but never obscures closure’s crystalline transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier trope via “relic” specificity and auroral physics. Emotional truth in Silas’s anxiety-to-calm arc avoids generic wonder; risk-taking in time-echoes heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
