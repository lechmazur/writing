<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s "respectfully rebellious" posture under drone surveillance, but Liora remains symbolic rather than fully individuated. Final realization earns emotional weight through concrete actions like bottle transfer, though cost feels slightly abstract despite the seven-year context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "healing was the work itself" reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of the "held breath" silence. Accumulative lens holds throughout with drone pressure and bottle delivery pattern tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The thunderstorm bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (forced speed) and charges the final image (blue pulse). But "brittle hush" risks thematic abstraction; cobalt arcade’s boarded entrance lacks causal pressure beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drone escalation narrows delivery window meaningfully, forcing Kael’s urgency with visible cost in posture and timing. However, the standoff resolution feels slightly convenient—drone retreat lacks sufficient consequence beyond tension, weakening the cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through action: "linking absences" manifests in bottled storms and window signals, avoiding moralizing. Final line ("silence felt less like oppression") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "broken promises heal" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "mechanical buzzard," "captured lightning" reflect Kael’s poetic resistance. Rhythmic control under drone pressure ("Time was up") modulates intensity perfectly. Minor register drift in "foster her spirit" slightly undermines voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bottled lightning flickered" shows textural density. But "a ghost of entertainment" slightly overwrites, and "foster her spirit" risks abstraction. No closure artifacts—final image’s "held breath" crystallizes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific, grounded choices: corked storm bottles, "linking absences" method. Emotional truth in quiet rebellion avoids generic templates. "Broken promises heal" premise feels fresh via Kael’s seven-year ritual.</comment>
