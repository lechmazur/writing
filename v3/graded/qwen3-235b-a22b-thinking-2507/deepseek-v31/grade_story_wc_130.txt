<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("logic refuge" vs. "messy complications") embodied through micro-choices with the glass eyes; earned epiphany avoids therapy-speak via concrete action ("trembling hands" peering through lenses), though flaw manifestation lacks deeper external consequence beyond internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies via glass-eye revelation into Charged Poise closure where "ambiguous loss" reweights to "geometry of resilience" with palpable cost ("relation to it forever changed"); orientation anchored by 60 words ("deep beneath moon-kissed hills").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cavern orchard micro-setting constrains every choice (silence enabling focus, dripping water as rhythm) and charges closure ("dripping stalactites were not weeping, but sustaining"); bioluminescent fungi and glass eyes evolve from decoration to thematic vessels through tactile use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantifying ambiguous loss) tightens through protagonist's agency—using glass eyes transforms knowledge, narrowing options from "unsolved" formulae to "map of resilience"; cost legible in her relinquished secrecy ("nothing left to hide") under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (mosaic fragments as "timeline," "rhythm of persistence") without moralizing; final image reweights "ambiguous loss" into "quiet, enduring life" as non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo through embodied insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("numbers easier than people," "shimmering formulae like gossamer") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("rhythmic *plink*") pays off in closure's "gentle rhythm of persistence" without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractured geometry held a key, a visual representation of fragmented heart") advances atmosphere and character; final line's "forever waiting to dovetail" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math and emotion via "geometry of resilience" transforms "ambiguous loss" trope; emotional specificity avoids genericity ("hole shaped like a might-have-been"), though risk-taking slightly constrained by familiar epiphany structure.</comment>
