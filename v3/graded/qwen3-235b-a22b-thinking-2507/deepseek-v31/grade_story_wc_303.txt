<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (preserve truth vs save tree) drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion ("wave of quiet desperation... washed over her") avoids labels. Minor underdevelopment in empire's threat limits stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "confronted not by anger... but profound grief" crystallizes the empire's fragility. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mulberry roots) constrains choice (coffee poured on soil enables prophecy) and charges closure ("velvet shadows" reframed by tree's hum). Velvet observatory evolves from backdrop to active pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (truth vs empire's facade) tightens through Elara's agency-driven escalation (helping fracture propagate). Cost unmistakable in final image: symbolic power shattered without violence, reconfiguring imperial authority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "profound grief" as resistance reweights empire's power without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer to "weigh dream against empire" with earned ambiguity (grief isn't victory but undeniable cost).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (researcher's pattern-spotting) modulates under pressure: "She would not stop the fracture. She would help it." compresses decision into visceral rhythm. Zero POV leaks despite telepathic shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; peak-beat prose crystallizes pressure: fracture propagating "not with a crack, but a sigh" avoids figurative muddle. Final line's rhythm ("and found the empire wanting") delivers thematic charge without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy trope into embodied burden ("mulberry ache"); risk-taking (silent protest via wilting) heightens stakes organically. Specific detail ("perforated destiny" as academic term) grounds universals without middle-ground hedging.</comment>
