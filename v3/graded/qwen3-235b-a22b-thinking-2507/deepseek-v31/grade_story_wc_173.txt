<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("chaste courtesan") and embodied micro-choices (deliberate hand extension) anchor motivation, but "exquisitely painful" lacks specific somatic detail during thread-untangling. Final smile earns change with visible cost through the silver thread pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: dissolved prism and wind's "honest sound" reconfigure options with felt cost in "weight of a thousand subdued lives flowed through her." Accumulative lens holds through thread-untangling density; orientation clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Snow's transformation from "suspended between sigh and smile" to "normal, fluttering waves" charges the final image, but courtyard fails to constrain choices beyond atmosphere. Prism threads function as micro-setting that directly shapes tactics via untangling mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating thread-untangling narrows options under Accumulative lens: each liberated echo ("chill of a poet," "heat of a warrior") deepens the lullaby's dissolution with visible cost in "shuddered through her own body." Dominant stake (defying conformity) signaled immediately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of silenced possibilities emerges through concrete threads (cobalt/vermilion strands), avoiding moralizing. Final smile in ice reweights conformity's cost non-literally, with "harvest of echoes" resolving into earned ambiguity—no thematic echo or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("snow not crunching but sighing," "luminous threads humming in teeth") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from languid courtly cadence to fragmented intensity during thread-pulling; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "torrent of might-have-beens" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ("faint, undeniable beginning of a true smile") recharges the opening's "bodily poetic" motif without muddle, though "sharp, cold thing within her" slightly abstracts emotion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "chaste courtesan" trope through prism-as-suppressed-potential avoids derivative safety. "Harvest of echoes" transforms conformity theme via specific, verifiable details (ledgers/sonnets, sword/plow), but snow's ubiquity slightly dilutes setting uniqueness.</comment>
