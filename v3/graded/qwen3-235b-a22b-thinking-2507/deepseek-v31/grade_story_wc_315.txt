<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motivation to preserve trust is concrete and drives her actions, with embodied emotion in "hands flew across the console" and tactile recall of the buckle. Lacks contradictory impulses under stress; interiority avoids therapy-speak but could deepen emotional layering beyond duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: Lena’s plunge crystallizes stance with undeniable cost ("silent arbor behind," storm-ravaged surface). Causality is flawless—buckle discovery enables manual override—yet the single tightening lacks a second pressure point for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (fits override panel) and charging the final image ("hands steady on controls"). Sensory hierarchy sharpens urgency: cosmic hiss to atmospheric roar mirrors her shift from observer to actor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: automated pod rejection forces manual override, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable—abandoning the arbor, risking death—but the single reversal lacks a secondary trade-off (e.g., time vs. safety) for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "watcher’s burden" evolves from passive duty to active rescue, reweighted by the final "determined light" image. No moralizing; complexity in duty vs. loyalty feels earned without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: scientific lexicon ("spectral readouts") blends with emotional urgency. Under stress, sentences shorten ("Then, silence"), and free indirect style ("She had always thought it was a metaphor") avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates with crisis ("violent screech," "jarring thud"). Final line’s density—"determined light against the immense, sleeping planet"—charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: "watcher" becomes rescuer, mentor’s gift becomes literal key. Emotional specificity in "profound loneliness tempered by responsibility" avoids cliché, though the arbor’s purpose revelation edges toward convenience.</comment>
