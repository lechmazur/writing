<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied grief ("calloused thumb" on ash grain) and micro-choice of carving cupped hand over lion. Slight thematic echo in "harvest lessons" risks over-articulation but redeemed by tangible action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: rough carving embodies containment of grief with visible cost (kettle's timed ache). "Rust-hued peace" crystallizes reconfiguration without sentimentality. Minor repetition of "here and gone" slightly dilutes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skylight loft functions as micro-setting that charges closure: steam-fogged glass refracting light into "tiny brilliant worlds" directly reweights grief. Rain/kettle steam constrain choices and modulate emotional pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing grief within art's boundaries) tightens via kettle's timeframe forcing decisive choice. Agency in rejecting literal lion carving for cupped hand narrows options with felt cost. Escalation subtle but coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash wood grain as "map of forgotten rivers" and final carving as "vessel for feeling." Avoids moralizing; "He was gone. But what he had taught her..." implies wisdom through concrete particulars without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory selection (linseed oil, sawdust ghosts) and rhythmic control ("grey murmur of a passing storm"). "Crushing silence" edges toward cliché but redeemed by precise "paw swipe" brutality. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("truth as simple and brutal as a paw swipe" slightly mixed metaphor). Zero loops; "refracted light, each one a tiny brilliant world" delivers closure image without muddle. Minor register drift in "crystallized time."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through specific craft: ash wood's "map of forgotten rivers" and cupped hand motif feel inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet closure (rough carving as enough) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Familiar premise elevated by lived detail.</comment>
