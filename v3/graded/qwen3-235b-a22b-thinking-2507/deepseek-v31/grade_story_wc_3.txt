<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grief that cloudled his reason" vs. methodical trade) embodied through seed handling; final renunciation of control earns closure with visible cost ("ache of loss now at a touching distance"). Avoids diagnostic label-speak during peak revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: seed release proves transition physics but yields no Elara message. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup ("triangle sign" revelation), with cost legible in final image's reweighted loss. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (Arbor platform edge) directly constrains climax choice; seed's warmth/tactility charges final sprout image. Sensory details filtered through scholar's bias ("baked-earth poetry") avoid cliché while mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's analogical realization narrowing options from forced decoding to surrender. Dominant stake (understanding transition physics) tightened via felt cost: releasing seed risks his last link to Elara, altering tactics irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (cuneiform sign → seed release), not moralizing. Final image ("ache... at a touching distance") offers resonant answer to "physics of transition" without stating moral, reweighting loss as testament.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tracing stylus marks," scholarly lexicon) modulates under pressure: compressed syntax during frustration ("familiar frustration") shifts to lyrical cadence at release. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("obsidian black and warm" seed description does triple duty). Final line's cadence ("ready to learn their language all over again") resolves with textural precision. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform scholarship and quantum physics avoids trope clichés. Emotional specificity in grief-as-barrier transforms "knowledge fruit seed" convention. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
