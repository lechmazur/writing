<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's "brightly attentive" trait lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but interiority remains observational without embodied conflict during high-stakes decryption. No visible tradeoffs when bypassing encryption, missing micro-choices that would reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "sensed absence was a location" reweights deletion with undeniable corporate-erasure cost. Causal lens holds perfectly—each number deciphers the next—but the final "countdown" signal lacks specific consequence to narrow Elara's options beyond dread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The virtual patch constrains choice and charges the final image ("embroidered threads now seeming like a gateway"), transforming from artifact to portal. Server hum evolves from background to "answering chorus," though occupational details about archive systems remain superficial despite plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as numbers unlock deeper layers, but the conceptual cost (erased consciousness) feels abstract until the transmission. Elara's agency drives escalation, yet the cost lacks visceral immediacy—her reaction ("stared," "sat back") misses physical embodiment of the horror she uncovers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: corporate archives as digital afterlife reframed by "downloaded" souls. Final image ("humming... distant answering chorus") delivers non-literal answer to "where deleted files go" without moralizing, reweighting the patch's absence as active consumption rather than passive loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sifted through petabytes," "echo of forgotten songs," yet stress degrades diction insufficiently—Elara analyzes "conceptual repricing" mid-crisis. Rhythmic control shines in fragmented transmission, but internal voice stays uniformly articulate during terror.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Felt of the virtual patch" typo aside, prose avoids loops with high density ("fragments across the echo of forgotten songs"). Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" during peak tension, but closure image ("looming presence") achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elevates digital-afterlife trope through celestial archive twist ("it's singing... we're being downloaded"), but corporate culpability premise feels familiar. Specificity in salvage-team patch and timestamp patterns grounds risk, though emotional truth lacks the rawness of true archival horror.</comment>
