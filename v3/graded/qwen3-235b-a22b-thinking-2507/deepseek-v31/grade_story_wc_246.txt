<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (professional discipline vs. mounting frustration) act simultaneously in the lurch-and-blood moment; the CR closure earns visible cost through the blood sacrifice reweighting the pen’s meaning. Slight over-articulation in "muttered to herself" line barely avoids diagnostic label penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost (blood bead reactivating the pen), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens via density shift in transcribed logs. Orientation anchors (Kappa-7, marooned interpreter) established by 80 words; lens clarity holds through the "chaos had a rhythm" pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pen functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("dipped the exotic nib in the well of her own experience"), while anomaly physics ("up felt diagonal") concretely constrain choices. Early tactile details (desiccated ink, diagonal gravity) avoid symbolic convenience by directly enabling the CR.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: transcribing logs narrows options to seeing "contingent relationships," with blood sacrifice as tangible cost. Dominant stake (deciphering signal) tightens via the pen’s evolving utility, foreclosing "fighting the anomaly" path for "following contortions."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "thresh meaning" becomes literal when blood reactivates the pen, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("began to translate") offers resonant answer to "harvest of failure" without stating a moral, leveraging the pen’s reweighted purpose for conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in professional jargon filtered through embodied stress ("cascading errors," "contingent relationships"). Rhythm modulates under pressure: fragmented syntax during the lurch ("A sudden lurch... sent her pen rolling") contrasts with lyrical closure, avoiding voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chaos had a rhythm" achieves high density without figurative muddle. Final line’s "well of her own experience" avoids cliché through specificity, while blood-as-ink reprise maintains propulsion. No register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: scientific process reframed as textual archaeology where "editing history" reveals signal. Avoids safety middle by embracing alien physics as communication; blood sacrifice transforms trope through specific, earned cost. No derivative premise guardrail triggered.</comment>
