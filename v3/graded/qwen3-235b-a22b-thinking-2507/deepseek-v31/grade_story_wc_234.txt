<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's embodied frustration ("hollow" output, tracing shell) and micro-choice to adjust emissions instead of containing show authentic contradiction; Kael's whispered insight creates credible pressure. Slight abstraction in "palette of resolve" phrasing risks therapy-speak but avoids diagnostic labels mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: star's rhythmic pulse crystallizes options (control vs flow) with visible cost (abandoned paradigm). Orientation flawless ("Twilight at Ember Nexus" anchors by word 10). Accumulative lens holds—Kael's shell deepens pressure through pattern break, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (guiding emissions along spiral) and charges closure ("held against her palm"). Cooling copper banks supply tangible resources; "velvety indigo" deepens sensory urgency without checklist overload. Environment actively shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing "density of presence") tightens through Kael's intervention, forcing Lyra's stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons rigid control for organic flow, altering tactics ("not building a prison... a shell"). Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: star's transformation reweights "density" as expansion, not stasis. Final image ("success measured not in lumens, but in life") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids binaries—control isn't wrong, just incomplete—embracing complexity through the shell's growth logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "logarithmic spiral," "resonant hum" reflect alchemist's precision. Rhythmic control peaks during adjustment ("pulse and swell along the prescribed curve"). No head-hopping; compression ("poured weeks into it") taught early and paid off in closure's density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "confident, rhythmic glow" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line ("set free upon its intended path") propels closure without muddle. Minor density risk in "impossible perfection" offset by context—peak beats prioritize clarity over ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Pocket-sun alchemist" transforms trope through specific constraints (light/time essence); nautilus as growth metaphor avoids cliché via "columella curl" precision. Emotional truth in Lyra's struggle elevates beyond sci-fi novelty—fresh synthesis where concept and character cohere inseparably.</comment>
