<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: laying out sheet music reveals her hierarchy of values (art vs. silence) with visible cost. No label-speak; "heart a frantic pendulum" grounds terror concretely. Micro-choice to present notes earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: renunciation of "loud" composition carries conceptual cost when notes "shimmer and lift" as light. Accumulative lens holds—density increase (water/sound/earth layers) reweights stakes with undeniable pressure. Cost proof clear in transformation of sheet music.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (kneeling to trace water) and charges final image (sound absorbed as light). Micro-setting functions as environment: quartz channels literally shape the story’s thematic current. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in navigation of sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her presentation of sheet music deepens the stake (redefining composition as listening). Cost unmistakable when notes transform—surrendering dream’s form but not essence. Tightening forecloses "loud" path while altering understanding, though bear’s arrival edges on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "dream not abandoned, but returned to the quiet" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to central question through sound-as-light transformation. Avoids thematic echo; complexity maintained via introversion reframed as strength, not flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scribe’s precision ("slender channels") merges with musical sensitivity. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for tension ("Elara froze"), flowing prose for description. Consistent focalization; psychic distance shifts intentionally during bear encounter without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petrichor nostalgia" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language sparse but potent ("heart a frantic pendulum"). Final line avoids cliché through concrete reconfiguration. One borderline abstraction ("profound stillness thick enough") prevents 10.0 but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: earth bear transforms "magical encounter" trope through sensory specificity (granite eyes, peat footsteps). Risk-taking heightens stakes—quiet closure earns resonance via bear drinking sound. Derivative premise guardrail cleared by redefining composition as listening, not being heard.</comment>
