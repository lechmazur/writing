<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; emotional progression over-tidy with no visible struggle during revelation. 'Her motivation was singular' borders on label-speak, diluting embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (weight of erased histories), but the felt cost of endurance isn't fully charged in the final image. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens constrains choice (focusing technique) and charges the final image ('cool now, its duty done'), satisfying micro-setting gate. Market atmosphere vivid but doesn't pressure choices beyond sensory backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring erased histories) tighten when lens reveals secondary painting, but the cost of bearing this history doesn't permeate the final beat. Escalation driven by agency, yet final image lacks visceral cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (painting as 'testament'), with final image reweighting translation as bridge-building. Avoids moralizing, though 'understood her role' slightly tells the earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ('boots whispering on wood', 'voice like shifting sand') with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ('The world shifted. The painting was no longer static pigment; it breathed.'). 'Furious knot of captured light' risks overwriting but saved by voice coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of 'between-worlds translator' with tangible history recovery; market specifics resist generic fantasy. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
