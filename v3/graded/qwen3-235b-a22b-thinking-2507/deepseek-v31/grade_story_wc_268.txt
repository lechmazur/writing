<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; final choice is earned but interiority leans declarative ("no despair") rather than embodied struggle. Strengths: embodied micro-choice (clutching ink pellet), flaws complicate tactics without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with legible cost in "scream of profound disorientation," but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening under Accumulative lens. Strength: orientation anchors by 80 words, lens consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ink pellet) charges final image as "period," constraining the climax's magic channeling. Weakness: library setting described vividly but doesn't pressure choices; petrified scrolls remain ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation succeeds via Accumulative density increase (scholarly focus → confrontation), with cost unmistakable in the pretender's unraveling. Strength: dominant stake signaled early; one meaningful deepening (rune activation) forecloses his path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-entropy emerges non-literally through ink pellet as period and "graceful collapse," avoiding moralizing. Weakness: "truth cannot be unwritten" borders on thematic echo but redeemed by embodied closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath of dead civilizations," cosmic scale) with rhythmic control under pressure; elision (time pauses) taught early. Zero register drift; voice modulates from scholarly to decisive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "scream of profound disorientation" avoids therapy-speak through visceral context. Final line ("library continued its graceful collapse") delivers high-density propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan trope (diminutive custodian) and rune-of-drift concept; risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "elegant entropy" avoids generic templates.</comment>
