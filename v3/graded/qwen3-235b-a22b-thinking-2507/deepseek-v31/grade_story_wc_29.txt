<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cautious hope" vs "unsetting suspicion") drives micro-choices like repurposing equipment under pressure; embodied exhaustion post-broadcast shows cost. Lacks deeper flaw exploration beyond "cosmic tricksters" motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("cautious hope battered but not broken") and conceptual reweighting of charts as "endless questions." Causal lens holds through subsonic countermeasure deployment resolving community division.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting of astronomical charts constrains choice (tracing patterns) and charges final image ("maps of answers" becoming "endless questions"). Ozone/coffee sensory details filtered through Aris' urgency narrow perception effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: signal strength → community division → discovery of subsonic manipulation. Agency-driven escalation peaks with broadcast decision; cost manifests as exhaustion and "infinite game" awareness. Single tightening suffices for scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic mirror concept: manipulation vs resistance reweights "endless silent questions" without moralizing. Final image rejects salvation/fear binaries, offering resonant ambiguity about cosmic engagement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("squinting at static," "fingers tracing charts") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control accelerates during broadcast prep ("fingers flew across console"). Minor tense consistency dip in reflection fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; high density ("subliminal narrative fed directly into subconscious" conveys complex idea efficiently). "Battered but not broken" edges toward cliché in closure but redeemed by concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms first-contact trope via subliminal manipulation angle. "Ethereal grit" synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking with sonic countermeasures heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth in academic's weaponized curiosity.</comment>
