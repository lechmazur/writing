<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s micro-choices (pruning as defiance, obsessive tending) reveal contradictory impulses (hollowness vs hope), but secondary characters’ reactions lack embodied cost—businesswoman’s sandcastle memory told, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: greenhouse reconfigured from "monument to loss" to "promise" with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds; celestial deadline tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse functions as micro-setting: iron tears constrain pruning labor, grime necessitates cleaning, and final image charges the closure. "Skeletal vines" embody decay but could deepen tool-specific constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via celestial alignment deadline (tightening tactics), but customers’ transformations lack visible cost—nurse’s "certainty" feels unearned without prior struggle. Elara’s personal cost (hollow past resolved) remains potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "synaptic plasticity" as tangible process—grandfather’s journal reframes memory as building blocks. Final image reweights "ruins" into future growth without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("iron skeleton wept orange tears"), but "synaptic plasticity" drifts into academic register for a chef. Rhythmic control falters slightly during fruit description’s stacked modifiers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor density issues: "luminous, pearlescent orb" risks purple prose; "synaptic plasticity" feels un-POV. No loops, but final paragraph’s "joyous taste of her own future" edges toward abstraction without sensory anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory-trope through chef/gardener synthesis: "taste memories" made visceral via molecular gastronomy. Emotional specificity in "hollow, featureless broth" past avoids generic apathy narratives.</comment>
