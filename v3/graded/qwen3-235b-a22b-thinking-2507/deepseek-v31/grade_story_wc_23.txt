<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and micro-choices (salvaging servo, incorporating bronze) reveal Elara's contradictory impulses. "Geography of loss" backstory risks abstraction but earns credibility through her physical actions. Final endurance as Earned Stasis carries visible cost ("station now a tomb"). Slight over-reliance on thematic label in peak beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively: her waiting crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("sole occupant"). Orientation clear by paragraph one (dying station, Elara's purpose). Hybrid lens (Situational → Accumulative) holds through the beam launch's conceptual repricing. Cost proof solid in "profound peace" amid tomb imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The patina bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (moon-phase potency) and charging the final image (warm bronze in darkness). Sensory details like "verdigris continents" and "ghostly blue glow" reflect urgency. Starlit signal station pressure is palpable through emergency power limitations, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve memory before death) tightens meaningfully: hydraulics failure → must build new array. Her frantic construction demonstrates agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in "tomb" realization. Moon-phase fluctuation isn't leveraged for tradeoffs, slightly weakening pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: censer foot's "warmth" and "silent scream" beam reweight loss as preservation. Final image ("warm bronze in darkness") offers non-literal answer to "how to survive loss" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through "tomb" imagery, achieving earned resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: notices "verdigris continents" and Earthlight's "faint" quality. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in staccato "To build. It was the only action left." Minor register drift in "geography of loss" phrase, but compression during construction ("hours bled together") serves Accumulative lens effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("grotesque and beautiful thing of shimmering wire") propels momentum. Figurative language ("silent scream containing everything") clarifies rather than obscures. Final image crystalline with "curled fingers around warm bronze." Slight thematic abstraction in "raw solace" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" trope transformed through specific, grounded choices: Oort Cloud sanctuary and bronze anchor. Emotional truth in choosing preservation over survival avoids generic elegy. Fresh inflection: sending "soul" via moon-phased object. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
