<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ellis’s face blindness flaw drives every choice, from cataloging features to the ribbon-triggered shift to empathy. Embodied contradiction shines when he imagines "the pulse at the wearer’s temple"—raw feeling overriding clinical method. No therapy-speak; cost crystallizes in "he could finally see one" despite unchanged condition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory accumulation (ribbon texture, quarry mist) until the portrait "breathes." Closure is Charged Poise—the detective’s stunned "It’s her" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation flawless by word 20; cost legible in "awakening something dormant" as Ellis redefines "seeing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment constrains choice across beats: evidence → tactile catalyst → palette companion. Its evolution charges closure when the portrait "began to breathe" from faded silk. Quarry’s mist mirrors obscured perceptions then "presses against the glass" at climax—environment directly reweights final image with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten irrevocably at "his motivation shifted, irrevocably" when empathy overrides method. Agency is pure protagonist choice: placing ribbon beside palette enables synthesis. Cost is unmistakable—"he could still not remember a face, but now he knew he could finally see one"—reconfiguring lifelong limitation under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "I drew who she was" avoids moralizing. Final portrait’s "unforgettable" gaze offers resonant answer to "how to see the unseen," reweighting face blindness as perceptual limitation overcome by empathy. No thematic echo—detective’s stunned "How?" keeps it grounded in earned struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "furrowed hush of graphite lines" establishes voice. Syntax modulates from clinical ("machine of synthesis") to lyrical ("mist churned like a sleeping beast") under pressure. Detective’s dialogue carries subtext ("The descriptions were all wrong") while preserving Ellis’s POV coherence through emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; opening’s "furrowed hush" recharges in final silence "deeper than before." High density: "a silent refuge from chaos of faces he could not retain" establishes flaw and stakes in 7 words. Rhythm varies purposefully—"He shaded the jawline... countered it"—with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "cold case portrait" trope through neurological specificity—face blindness as both curse and solution. Emotional truth in "he had met her," avoiding generic "art heals" tropes. Risk-taking in making the artist’s flaw the resolution engine; quarry/ribbon synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
