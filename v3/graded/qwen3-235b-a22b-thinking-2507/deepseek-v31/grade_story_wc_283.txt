<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (accepting but transforming The Great Stillness) drives earned closure; embodied emotion via calloused hands and resonant button sorting avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice placing obsidian button reveals hierarchy of values with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "narrow path exploded into spectrum" reconfigures prophecy under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3 ("amber warehouse beneath cliffs"); lens taught early via "spin prophecy into raw possibility."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: button drawers supply resources that directly alter fate's mechanics. Buttons constrain choice (sorting by resonance) and charge final image with "flecks of gold/silver," meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when echo's meaning unravels, narrowing options to button cataloging. Agency-driven deepening shifts knowledge ("prophecy not fixed point") with visible conceptual cost in the hourglass transformation, satisfying Band 8.8+ guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of swirling sands offers non-literal answer to "can fate be reshaped?" through button particulars (priest's pearl, child's clay). Avoids moralizing; thematic resonance emerges from cataloged choices without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile ("calloused hands"), amber-hued light, and resonant silence. Voice modulates under pressure ("days bled into one another") with consistent focalization; canyon echo's "stone sighing" maintains idiom distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("mosaic of forgotten dreams" does triple duty). Final line "beautifully unravel" charges closure without figurative muddle. Varied rhythm supports pressure ("She sorted them not by size... but by subtle resonance").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through specific button cataloging mechanic. "Lost buttons as shed possibilities" synthesizes fate theme with mundane objects, creating emotional truth. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
