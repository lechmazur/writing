<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the fossil ritual vs. manufactured drought; micro-choice (releasing egg) reveals hierarchy of values with felt cost. Epiphany risks tidiness but avoids diagnostic labels through concrete rain-on-fossil trigger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "he was its jailer" crystallizes stance with conceptual price. Accumulative lens holds—thunder/rain pressure narrows options cleanly. Orientation clear by line 3 ("salt flat").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (fossilized egg) constrains the climax—its "definitive click" charges the final image. Salt flat isn’t backdrop: cracks map the path, salt dust transforms his suit into "ghost," directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single tightening—rain breaking the drought—forces stance crystallization. Dominant stake (preserving vs. freeing echoes) narrows to irreversible choice with visible cost (losing the egg). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("echo was finally free") reweights "canyon not vault" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: fossil’s "plinking" rain, "click" in darkness. Avoids sentimentality by making cost tactile, not abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "gritty whisper" of shoes, salt’s "palpable quiet." Rhythm modulates under stress—"With a cry..." compresses syntax without voice loss. Zero filter verbs in high-pressure release beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ossified tear" and "definitive click" deliver high density. Final line ("turned toward the coming rain") resolves with image recharging "lull of distant thunder." No figurative muddle in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "billionaire savior" trope through specific moral calculus: drought as business tactic, egg as secret vulnerability. Fresh inflection in "jailer of echoes" metaphor—avoids middle-ground hedging by embracing broken authenticity.</comment>
