<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied reactions (paling face, tear), but grandmother’s "impossible choice" backstory risks summary without sufficient micro-choice alteration to present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the tear’s cost (shattered inherited meaning) reconfigures the hair’s significance with Accumulative/Textural lens coherence; orientation anchors by paragraph 2 avoid penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Starlight-dust sigil functions as micro-setting that constrains Lysander’s method, charging the final image; "cobblestones" and "lamp" provide tactile specificity without overloading momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lysander’s disorienting story (9E), narrowing options by shattering the woman’s fixed perception; cost is felt in the tear’s erosion of inherited truth, though cosmic phrasing slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the hair’s reweighted meaning ("just hair" vs. "legacy"), avoiding moralizing; "grief was love persevering" skirts platitude but gains resonance via the tear’s embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cobalt bled from sky" and dust-mote sigils; rhythmic control under pressure ("voice soft but relentless") with no head-hopping, though "cosmic possibility" repetition slightly disrupts lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but "trapped bee" metaphor creates coherence tension (hair can’t hum); strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently, though "unassumingly bold" borders on label-speak in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Risk-taking in starlight-method transforms the "enigmatic locksmith" trope; specificity of "faded velvet ribbon" and "Vesper" creates fresh emotional calculus without gimmickry.</comment>
