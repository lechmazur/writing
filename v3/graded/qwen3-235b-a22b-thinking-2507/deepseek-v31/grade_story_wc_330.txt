<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("interpret silence as possibility") is clear but interiority leans on labels ("quietly persistent pursuit") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. Final choice to offer silence feels earned, yet emotional progression lacks friction—her resolve never wavers despite the carousel's decay, missing a critical micro-choice that would heighten cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the carousel's song reconfigures silence into resilience with conceptual cost ("she had given it her silence"). Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the misting hush thickening intensifies pressure, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening—the shift from repair to singing feels unearned by prior causality, missing a decisive deepening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering gleam and misting hush create vivid atmosphere, yet setting fails the 9+ gate: the damp earth and rot constrain movement minimally but don't alter tactics or charge closure. The halo fragment (micro-setting) elevates the final image, but the abandoned train remains ornamental backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can joy be restored?) is signaled early, and the deepening—"it needed to sing"—narrows options. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; Elara's realization feels passive ("this was not a thing to be repaired"), and the cost ("her silence") remains abstract without visceral, on-page forfeiture during the singing climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through particulars: the carousel's song reweights "silence as possibility" into a resonant answer about shared vulnerability. No moralizing—only the final image charges the cost of giving silence—but the near-absence of moral ambiguity slightly softens complexity, preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory details ("every droplet a tiny, shimmering prism"), yet under stress, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("a wave of absolute certainty") clashing with her silent carpenter POV. Rhythmic control falters in the climax with repetitive "misting hush" phrasing, diluting immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("misting hush had fallen... misting hush thickened") and overwriting ("whispering gleam intensified, painting the decay in silver and gold") create scaffold without payoff. High-pressure beats avoid figurative muddle, but synonym churn in the climax ("smooth, graceful purpose" vs. "jerky, grinding agony") dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms "restoration" into mutual exchange (silence for song), avoiding sentimentality through specific, lived detail like the mother-of-pearl fragment. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but the emotional arc's inevitability lacks a fresh inflection—Elara's success feels too tidy for the ruin's weight.</comment>
