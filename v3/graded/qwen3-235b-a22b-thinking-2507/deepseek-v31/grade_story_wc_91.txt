<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks during climax; "profound calm" glosses over the felt cost of destitution. Motivation is clear but the pivotal release lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses (e.g., fear of final loss vs. compelled giving). Embodied emotion weakens at the transformation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the sand realization, but cost remains conceptual ("destitute of coin but rich") without visceral on-page manifestation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet the "quiet coalescence" lacks the felt physical cost demanded by the rubric’s cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Black sand functions as micro-setting: constrains choice via tactile sifting and charges the final image ("countless individual truths... forming a new shore"). Specificity (obsidian grit, warm granules) integrates with action and theme, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract (understanding "texture" vs. tangible loss); escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. The detour feels fated, not agentic, and coincidence (prophecy fulfillment) resolves pressure without Elara’s active trade-off, violating the lens guardrail for Accumulative designs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sand motif’s reweighting at closure ("slow rearrangement"), avoiding moralizing. However, "quiet coalescence" slightly over-tidies the complexity; the final epiphany lacks the ambiguous counter-readings that would elevate it beyond earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice modulates effectively with pressure (e.g., "vibrant hush" to "true peaceful silence"), but peak moments lapse into abstraction ("profound, unquenchable need"). Perceptual signature weakens during the climax, losing character-specific diction for lyrical generality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; final image ("warm sand... smooth and perfect") achieves crystalline specificity. Minor overwriting in setup ("roaring river... dry earth") slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat avoids figurative muddle, meeting the 9+ quick test threshold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes via granular focus on "texture," avoiding cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure, quiet closure) heightens stakes coherently. The sand motif’s specificity rescues the volcano setting from derivativeness, fulfilling the synthesis test for high-band originality.</comment>
