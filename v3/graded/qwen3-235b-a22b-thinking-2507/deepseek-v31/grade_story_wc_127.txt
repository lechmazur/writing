<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "affectionate detachment" epiphany—crafted replica embodies her isolation. Micro-choice pressing blotter to sap wall reveals value hierarchy: authenticity over clinical precision. Slight over-articulation of "symphony of genuine feeling" risks therapy-speak but redeemed by immediate action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "sigh that held the first genuine emotion... quiet, aching loneliness" crystallizes her irreversible loss. Accumulative lens holds—pressure deepens through sensory density in grotto. Cost proof is visceral in final image; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains every pivotal choice: sap becomes essential carrier, weeping walls supply the "honeyed drop" that solves her crisis. Final image of infused blotter directly charges closure—environment isn’t backdrop but active catalyst. Micro-setting (sap rivulet) alters tactics irreversibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when grotto’s sap redefines her method—agency shifts from vial manipulation to embodied creation. Dominant stake (authentic "fusion") escalates through her sensory immersion, culminating in visible cost: her loneliness as price for professional triumph. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the blotter’s transformation: "map to a place she could never visit" reweights counterfeit emotion premise without moralizing. Final image resonates as non-literal answer—her profound half-truth embodies the story’s core tension between intellect and empathy. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: tasting emotions via static electricity filters all description. Rhythm modulates from clinical ("metal and algebra") to lyrical ("patient sweetness of the sap") under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during grotto immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or character. "Honeyed drop of sap bleed into the paper" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s propulsion ("job was done") crystallizes closure without overwriting. Slight register drift in "symphony" mitigated by immediate action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "counterfeit emotion" trope through synesthetic mechanics and AI client. Bold risk in making protagonist emotionally hollow pays off thematically—the sap-infused blotter solution feels inevitable yet fresh. Emotional specificity ("fondness for its clever mimicry") avoids generic templates.</comment>
