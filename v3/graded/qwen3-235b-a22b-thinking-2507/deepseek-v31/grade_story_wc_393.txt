<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied tension ("words caught in his throat"), micro-choices (unwrapping the heart with tight voice), and credible flaw (chaplains' helplessness vs. duty). Prisoner's motivation remains told, not shown through prior scene work, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost (tears, "relentless action" realization), but storm/light coincidence risks resolving tension. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant at end) nearly breaches high-band gate; midpoint lacks firm lens teaching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shop setting functions as micro-setting: lemon polish/dust motes establish sensory hierarchy, while sunbeam's timing directly constrains Liam's repair work and charges the final heartbeat image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening via pivot arm discovery earns escalation, but cost remains emotional (tears) rather than altering tactics—no visible price paid that changes Liam's or Vale's subsequent actions beyond realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the heartbeat's function ("testament to repair"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "deserve" without stating a moral, though Liam's explicit "relentless action" line edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Vale notices moral weight ("soul depended on it"), Liam tactile mechanics. Slight register drift in final paragraph ("relentless, deliberate action") risks thematic assertion over scene pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm ("thrum-thump, thrum-thump"), but final abstraction ("relentless, deliberate action") weakens show-don't-tell. No fatal loops, though "vibrant hush" repetition slightly dilutes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craft/redemption avoids cliché, but "second opinions" concept remains ornamental. Emotional specificity in the heart's purpose elevates beyond trope, though prisoner's backstory lacks transformative detail.</comment>
