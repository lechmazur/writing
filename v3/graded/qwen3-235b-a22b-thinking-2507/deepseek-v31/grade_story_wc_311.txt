<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs yearning) embodied in micro-choices like holding the page aloft; "fractured purpose" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete action. Final naming choice earned by sacrifice memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("weight transformed into something he could hold") with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds from hum to crystallization without causality breaks. Orientation flawless by word 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory’s oculus light actively constrains the climax (prismatic pool enabling crystallization). Final star-witnessed departure charges the closure. Micro-setting (vellum page) evolves from discovery to ritual object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: hum → swirling echoes → crystallization. Protagonist agency drives every intensification; cost legible in "echo of sacrifice" becoming "monument." No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (naming fears as love vocabulary), not abstraction. Final "lexicon of glittering stones" reweights loss without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "quiet departure."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("skeletal fingers tracing brass grooves," "papery flutter"). Rhythm modulates perfectly—long sentences for atmosphere, staccato phrasing at climax. Zero POV leakage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light fractured by ancient glass" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language serves pressure ("shadows like skeletons of sea creatures"). Minor abstraction in "fractured purpose" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: reaper’s scientific grief (observatory tools) + mythic cartography. Crystallized voices as gems feel inevitable yet surprising. +0.3 risk bonus for unconventional structure heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
