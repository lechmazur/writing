<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orin’s motivation as "translator between generations" is embodied in micro-choices (delicate tools on the music box, harmonica visits), with contradictory wistfulness/determination. Limited interior depth in peak beats prevents 9.0; "archeologist of joy" insight lacks layered cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "melody filled the space... completing something broken" crystallizes cost through sensory fusion. Accumulative lens holds—density of lavender/harmonica reweights stakes without causal turns. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Feral loft’s buried shipwreck actively charges closure ("mingling with salt air"), while the music box’s physicality (tarnished gull, withered lavender) constrains Orin’s choices. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-rooted ("sky was pale, thin gruel").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Orin’s agency: music box transforms passive collection into active resurrection, narrowing options to "sweetening" fading memories. Cost is unmistakable in Miss Elara’s "crackly but true" voice and weeks of searching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lavender/score particulars, not moralizing. Final image ("past and present harmonized") reweights "translator" premise with conceptual cost—no thematic echo. Avoids sentimentality via fragility of rediscovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("voice like gravel rolling with tide") and rhythmic control under pressure. Harmonica playing shows rather than tells emotional shift. Minor syntactic monotony in dawn description prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere/character ("sea sighing against the shore"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("hands were maps of old ropes"). Closure image crystal-clear with no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "broken" music box as vessel (not mechanism) transforms memory tropes. Emotional specificity in Orin’s "wistful hope" avoids quirkiness. Lacks bold structural risk to reach 9.0 band despite strong coherence.</comment>
