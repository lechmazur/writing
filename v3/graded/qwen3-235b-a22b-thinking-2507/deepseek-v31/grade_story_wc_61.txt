<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (observe vs. intervene) drives her micro-choice to spin the gear as prism, with visible cost in violating generational non-interference. Embodied emotion avoids labels ("rigid inherited paths of its origin" concretely manifests her conflict).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: probe’s transformed echo crystallizes reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost ("infinite calculations approximating something true"). Accumulative lens holds through density shift (violent pinging → gentle echo), orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Nebula Garden functions as active micro-setting: gas petals recoil from probe’s scan, constraining Elara’s tactics; "sigh of falling petals" timeframe tightens decisions. Final image’s "luminous petal" charges closure by transforming serenity into promise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens as probe’s scan forces Elara to transform her non-interference rule. Agency is clear (initiating transit, weaving signal), with conceptual cost legible in breaking generational patterns to preserve the garden’s essence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear’s transformation ("approximating infinity through division" → "approximating something true"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights opening "troubling serenity" into promise without stating a moral, satisfying Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("coalescence of ambient light") filters all description; rhythm modulates under pressure (compressed syntax during probe confrontation). Purposeful compression taught early ("quiet sigh of falling petals") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("cradling the cold gear, she felt the weight of infinite small decisions" fuses action/emotion/theme). Final line’s cadence ("sigh now sounding like a promise") achieves rhythmic closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes via specific constraints: "otherworldly sentimentalist" defined through concrete action (spinning gear as prism), not label. Emotional truth in "troubling serenity" feels inevitable, avoiding generic cosmic awe.</comment>
