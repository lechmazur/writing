<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("discover what happens after goodbye") drives micro-choices like studying the scar, but backstory reflection lacks dramatized conflict with Architects; contradictory impulses alternate rather than coexist under pressure during escape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost (fragment disintegration, sensory shift); causal chain (storm→mutiny→magnetic conduit→escape) holds tightly. Reflection block meets BRR by altering tactics via scar study, avoiding momentum loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite actively constrains choices (shifting walls create corridor), and amulet fragment as micro-setting charges the final image; misses 9.0 by not using body as setting despite strong sensory evolution from sterile to organic chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (timing move with storm, using fragment) with visible cost (crumbling shard), but internal conflict (curiosity vs safety) lacks dramatized hesitation; solar storm's "live clock" tightens decisions without countdown specificity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("grains of sand," fragment disintegration), avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "goodbye" non-literally. Slightly undermined by early "discover what happens after goodbye" bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measured eternity in grains of sand") with rhythmic control under pressure; syntactic variety (short tension phrases vs lyrical reflection) reflects her state. No head-hopping; reflection block maintains consistent ancient-POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("fragment strained, a compass needle desperate for true north" conveys action/metaphor/motivation). Final line resolves by image without figurative muddle. "Familiar ache" slightly edges toward stock phrasing but immediately grounded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms immortal-boredom trope through specific mechanics (dimensional awareness enabling magnetic escape); emotional truth in curiosity about historical erasure. Avoids safety middle via messy freedom (fragment disintegrates), meeting risk-distinction bonus.</comment>
