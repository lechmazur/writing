<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine when baking calms her panic yet fuels active resolve; micro-choice of shaping city initials over loved ones deepens motivation. Late beekeeper reflection slightly edges toward summary but avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: bread-casting crystallizes shift from preservation to active memory-thawing with ocean’s emptiness as felt cost. Valve thawing risks slight convenience but turbine hum earns agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Waterfall’s roar physically pressures her climb; thermal wraps and bread crust constrain choices. Emerald lens recharges final image—"thaw memory itself" charged by prior green glow motif—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through lens thawing: physical act forecloses preservation-only path with visible cost (dread transforming into resolve). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though beekeeper absence isn’t leveraged enough for secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread ritual’s evolution from petition to promise; final image rejects nostalgia’s "rosewater dread" without moralizing. "Thaw memory itself" reweights premise with conceptual cost of active hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "green glow... lodestar" reflects curator’s visual bias; rhythm compresses under waterfall’s roar. Bread’s "crispy G and C" avoids filter verbs while anchoring tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "roaring, blinding force" propels momentum. "Rosewater dread" repetition in Q7 is minor paraphrase but closure image ("endless, empty ocean") remains razor-sharp. Figurative language stays earned in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of preservationist-as-activist: baking ritual transforms from passive tradition to tool for memory-thawing. Grotto city’s dying arts premise avoids dystopian clichés through tactile specificity (limestone hives, thermal wraps).</comment>
