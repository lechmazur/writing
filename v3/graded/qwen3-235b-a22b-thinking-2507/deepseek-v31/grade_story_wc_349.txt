<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—quest for story origins versus custodianship—earn her final shift through precise procedural focus under pressure; man’s embodied anguish ("shimmering form pulsing") avoids therapy-speak. Slight interior friction gap during incising beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "she was its diligent custodian" crystallizes her redefined purpose amid spent moonlight. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—absence quantification tightens options without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices: moonlight filament triggers environment’s reactive projections ("glass leaves flickering"), charging the final image as Elara surveys clouds. Micro-setting (bottled light) dictates tactics, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency—quantifying absence narrows options to surgical incision—reweights dominant stake (story origins) with felt cost (spent moonlight, man’s transformation). Pressure deepens via procedural precision, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "quantifying absence" reframes renewal without moralizing. Final image ("diligent custodian") reweights quest non-literally, avoiding binaries. Zero thematic echo; cost legible in spent bottle’s darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mindfully scattered" curated chaos) shapes selective detail; rhythm modulates from lyrical opening to procedural urgency. No head-hopping; compression taught early via "integrated fragmentation" and paid off in closure’s quiet cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture ("gentle, swirling silver" → "dark, its energy spent"). Figurative language precise in peak beats ("surgically removing their power"), propelling closure without muddle. Final line crystallizes theme through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory/vendor tropes via "quantifying absence" mechanics. Emotional specificity in incision procedure (liberation ≠ erasure) transforms clichés; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes coherently. No derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
