<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("fingers closed around storm glass") and motivation clear, but lacks contradictory impulses; Elara’s flawless competence caps high-band entry per global gate. No visible flaw in closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (old woman’s unclenched hands); Accumulative lens held perfectly. Orientation clear by line 25. Cost proof: "shoulders dropped as she breathed out" legibly charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm glass vial constrains every key choice (positioning gondola, striking arch) and charges closure; "feathery suspension" reweights silence as active comfort. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmospheric description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency (Elara’s precise arch positioning) under Accumulative lens, but cost remains relational (old woman’s relief) not personal, limiting Q4’s high-band entry despite flawless pressure build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through storm glass’s physical reconfiguration: silence as "presence" not void. Avoids moralizing by showing (old woman’s relief) not telling; final image reweights "train whistle’s echo" as transmuted energy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline structures... mostly clear") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression ("fluid dip and pull of the oar") taught early; no POV leakage. Final line’s "drifted toward the next call" modulates voice perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "murky cloud" to "feathery state" shows high density without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies ("She positioned..."; "The tone bloomed...") to mirror tension shifts. Final line’s "drifted toward the next call" avoids closure beat artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "silence as active comfort" via storm glass mechanics. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for noise/silence conflict) heightens stakes, but emotional specificity lacks one irreplaceable detail to breach 9.0 (e.g., Elara’s personal stake beyond vocation).</comment>
