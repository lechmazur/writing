<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the mask/ash ritual duality, but the climax lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; "painful, perfect truth" edges toward tidy resolution without sufficient irrational struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the smudged portrait integrates ash and memory, with undeniable conceptual cost in "the mirage had vanished"; Accumulative lens held through rocking chair's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the rocking chair’s creak functions as a live clock that pressures Elara’s timing, while the porcelain mask’s "webwork of silver" directly charges the final smudged image’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via the chair’s slowing creak narrows temporal options under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in the portrait’s dissolution, though the "fleeting emotion" stake could deepen earlier friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the mask’s "terrifyingly beautiful" mirage reweights into "painful, perfect truth" without moralizing; no thematic echo despite high conceptual density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—"granular grit of ashes," "rhythmic, aching creak"—with syntax accelerating during the blowing sequence then settling into quiet closure; zero register drift under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "plumed across the drawing, the fine particles settling... merging... blurring" achieves crystalline density in the closure beat without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ash-scattering ritual transforms grief into fresh metaphor; risk-taking (destroying the portrait to capture truth) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional specificity could deepen.</comment>
