<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (celestial yearning vs. shore-bound pragmatism) drive the pole navigation choice; closure renunciation of grand expectations earns cost through embodied "hollow ache" easing without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: regrets losing "punishing edge" while compass becomes "artifact" shows undeniable emotional cost; Accumulative lens holds through pole-by-pole reweighting of purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Utility poles constrain navigation tactics and charge the final image ("paddling toward the next pole"); fog's active pressure makes micro-setting indispensable despite near-swap potential with buoys.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via rhythmic paddling deepens perspective shift; cost is unmistakable when regrets cease "anchoring him to the past" during the outcrop pause, driven by Elias' agency in choosing poles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of paddling toward poles offers resonant answer to "how to live" without moralizing; theme emerges from celestial-to-utility navigation contrast, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sailor-specific details ("choppy water," "wires humming"); rhythmic control mirrors paddling cadence, though "flickering faith" repetition slightly dilutes pressure in reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "flickering faith" recurrence (paras 4-5) creates subtle paraphrase loop; otherwise high density with propulsion, but final image clarity loses 0.1 due to near-redundant phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of midlife crisis through navigation metaphors; "utility poles over stars" transforms tropes via specific emotional calculus, though not radically innovative beyond the premise's execution.</comment>
