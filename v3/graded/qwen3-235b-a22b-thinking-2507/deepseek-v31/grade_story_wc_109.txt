<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in obsession with silence as both refuge and map, but "quiet awe" lacks embodied specificity; micro-choice interpreting the flake as completion shows values hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (decay becoming guidance), but orientation test passes narrowly; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through deepening stillness yet single reversal lacks escalation density for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (booklet) constrains choice and charges closure: its fragility becomes the map's key; "calloused fingers" and "gold leaf" integrate tool-specific tactility that reconfigures the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (mapping endless night) tightens via deepening silence, but pressure relies solely on atmospheric shift; protagonist agency in interpreting the flake earns cost, yet escalation lacks one additional intensification beat for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (silence as topography), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "endless night" as journey with conceptual cost, though secondary stake ("fear") remains underdeveloped in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in vellum texture observations, but "resinous, trapping" slightly muddles metaphor; rhythmic control under pressure holds, though final paragraph's repetition of "hush" strains consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Adjacent synonym loops ("ambered hush... marbled hush... profound stillness") and mixed metaphor ("resinous, trapping") in closure beat dull immediacy; high density elsewhere insufficient to offset final-third artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence as cartography feels inevitable, but "endless night" trope lacks transformation beyond expected metaphor; specificity in gold-leaf mechanics elevates without full risk-taking in structure.</comment>
