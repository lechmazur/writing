<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's olfactory sensitivity and embodied anxiety (e.g., "knot of anxiety grew within her") create tangible interior contradiction; her final acceptance of the scent as "neither good nor bad" earns closure through prior causality without over-tidying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively when Elara breathes the scent, accepting rot as part of serenity; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds with cost ("frustration overwhelming her") narrowing options to endurance, though the tide timeframe lacks causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The burlap sack's charcoal drawings function as micro-setting that charges the final image (used as liner), but the treetop village remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices; olfactory detail powerfully narrows perception during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds as Elara's impatience compounds ("resent the plant’s slow pace"), culminating in the sleeve-brush triggering the scent; cost is unmistakable in her surrender to the smell's inevitability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the corpse flower’s rot-as-purification metaphor without moralizing; the final image ("breathing deeply, accepting the scent") reweights serenity as transformation, avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("olfactorily sensitive," "wildflower hush") modulates with pressure; minor register drift in "journalized" twice slightly disrupts voice cohesion under stress despite strong rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No closure-dulling artifacts, but scaffold phrases ("her ambition was not for fame, but...") and repetitive "journalized" usage trigger −0.3 loop penalty; high density otherwise with purposeful sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spiritual quest through botanical specificity avoids cliché; the corpse flower’s transformative rot feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (sensory overload as epiphany) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
