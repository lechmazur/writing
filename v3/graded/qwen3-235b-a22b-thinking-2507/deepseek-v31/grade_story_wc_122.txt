<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile specificity—numbness shattered through vibration, not abstract triumph. Contradictory impulses (grief/teaching) drive micro-choices like backward phonograph method. Leo’s frustration heat and Inara’s chest-to-heart technique avoid label-speak. Only slight thinness in Leo’s depth prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: silent applause reconfigures silence as sacred with visceral cost ("numbness shattered... by its opposite"). Accumulative lens holds—vibration density escalates from jagged tremor to "magnificent answer." Orientation clear by para 1; cost proof in skin-feeling vibrations during applause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drum maker’s cavern actively constrains choices: sound absorption necessitates vibration focus, stone floor transmits tremors. Broken phonograph needle functions as micro-setting—backward grooves enable tactile harmony, charging the final image where Inara feels "ancient effort" and "magnificent answer" simultaneously.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating numbness) signaled immediately. Escalation via vibration quality: Leo’s screeching → gliding bow → recital’s "tactile harmony." Agency in Inara’s backward-method teaching and Leo’s endurance. Cost unmistakable: numbness shatters only through sustained vibration work, foreclosing auditory hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "remade silence into something sacred" via final silent applause. Central question ("can feeling replace sound?") answered non-literally by vibration-as-conversation. Avoids moralizing—no thematic echo, only resonant image charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature consistent: sound as vibration ("jagged tremor," "frantic scratching"). Rhythm mirrors tactile focus—staccato for tension, flowing for harmony. Minor register drift in "emotional numbness" (clinical term), but compression under stress ("filament of hush") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "deepening chill on stone walls" anchors setting without scaffold. Zero loops—vibration descriptions vary (tremor/hum/conversation). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting. One slight tell: "felt the change... through deepening chill" could be more embodied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: deaf musician using broken phonograph’s backward grooves for tactile music. Transforms "deaf artist" trope through specific mechanics (reverse vibration patterns). Emotional truth in numbness-to-connection arc; risk-taking (silent recital) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
