<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in scar's shame transforms via embodied micro-choices; 'river on a map' reframing shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Cost in shed crystalline defense makes transformation credible. No therapy-speak; anxiety manifests as physical lattice. Minor deduction: 'budding' status underutilized in ritual stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening toward Charged Poise closure. Steam's straight column to wavered trajectory mirrors internal shift with visible cost in skin's transformation. Orientation perfect by opening line; cost proof in 'fortified flesh' reconfiguration. Final image crystallizes options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (steam column) directly constrains ritual success and charges closure: stillness enables inscription, release triggers wind's return. Platform's motion affects tactics; teacup's scent grounds sensory hierarchy. Final 'profound stillness' reweights environmental pressure. Irreplaceable constraint elevates to 9.7.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via scar's 'old shame'; escalation driven by protagonist's agency when crystallization forces childhood breath technique. Tightening forecloses fear path through visible cost: 'fortified flesh' replaces defensive lattice. Wind's return post-release proves earned consequence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar's transformation from 'wound' to 'map of breath between storms' without moralizing. Final teacup sip ('taste... of peace') reweights opening petrichor with earned resonance. Avoids false binaries; crystalline silver rune embodies complexity. Non-literal answer to 'can shame become strength' charges closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: scholar's precision ('needle’s point') filters storm petrichor and tea scent. Rhythm modulates perfectly—compressed syntax during breath-hold ('Time compressed. The world narrowed'), lyrical flow in transformation. Zero filter verbs; stress shortens diction without voice break. Final line's cadence crystallizes theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'crystalline lattice spiderweb' does triple duty (trait/emotion/metaphor). Final 'thunderclap' breath release delivers sonic payoff to 'saturated hush'. No figurative muddle: 'amber preserving courage' charges closure without overwriting. Every sentence advances pressure or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms 'scar as trauma' trope via crystallization biology and ritual specificity. 'Breath between storms' made literal through held-breath timeframe—not metaphor but causal mechanism. Emotional truth in reframing scar as 'river path' avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
