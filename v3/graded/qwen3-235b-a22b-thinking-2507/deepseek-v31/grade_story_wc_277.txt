<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices (tracing star charts, metallic taste) but "lifelong compulsion" label slightly undermines visceral specificity in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds flawlessly; Earned Stasis closure lands with undeniable cost (blotted page, observatory's shifted resonance) as Viola actively chooses truth's "exhausting gravitational calculations" over easy profit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory and rosewood pen function as micro-setting: telescope judges, pen constrains choice, and clouds reconfigure from barrier to foundation in the final image, charging closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently from personal revolt to city-wide collapse via Viola's logic, but economic destabilization remains slightly abstract versus visceral felt cost in the "black hole of scandal" image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (writing corrective column) not moralizing; final image of "quiet, permanent ink" reweights truth's value without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("orbits of regret," "gravitational calculations") modulates perfectly under pressure; rhythmic control in proof-by-contradiction sequence teaches pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issue in "consequences spiraled outward" paragraph slightly muddles causality, but "permanent India ink" specificity and zero scaffold loops maintain propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalism ethics with astronomy metaphors avoids trope; "solemn playfulness" risks boldness by framing moral dilemma through cosmic scale without gimmickry.</comment>
