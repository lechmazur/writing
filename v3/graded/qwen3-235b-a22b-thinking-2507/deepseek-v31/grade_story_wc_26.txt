<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied regret as "glowing inside her" earns change. Lacks contradictory impulses during quarantine decision—resolve feels unconflicted despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("cold pressure against her mind"). Orientation anchors by line 3; causal lens (discovery→investigation→containment) holds. Minor ellipsis in log analysis strains immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the river stone constrains all key choices (discovery, analysis, quarantine). Bio-luminous vines and shadow’s physics directly charge the final image—environment as active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under causal lens: curiosity → horror → containment race. Cost ("hunger against her mind") is legible but slightly abstract. One tightening suffices, yet geomancer’s logs comparison lacks friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment>Theme emerges organically through stone/shadow motif; "luminous regret" reweights hope’s cost without moralizing. Final image ("forging hope into a shield") resonates non-literally but avoids deeper moral complexity in consumption metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") drives selective detail. Voice modulates perfectly under stress ("chill that had nothing to do with climate"). Slight POV overreach in "metabolizing his hope" implies geomancer’s internal state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pool of darkness that stretched and shifted independently" exemplifies precise propulsion. "Race against time" slightly generic in high-pressure beat—minor register drift from otherwise controlled voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-archiving and parasitic shadows. Risk-taking (commodity-as-pathogen) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Geomancer’s logs comparison lacks novelty, but stone’s shadow physics transforms the trope.</comment>
