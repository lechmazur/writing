<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("heart hammered against ribs") but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice feels inevitable without visible internal tradeoffs despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost (exhaustion, spent energy in fading graffiti); Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as sensory density tightens toward the lightning-flash transmission window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as essential micro-setting—constraining the console insertion under storm pressure and charging the final image with tangible warmth, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (decoding glyphs against storm clock) with felt cost, but bolt plate solution lacks meaningful friction; tightening is sufficient yet misses the trade-off depth needed for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (singing as "stitching through chaos"); final image of "new melodies in static" offers resonant non-literal answer to "unspoken needs" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("driftingly alert," noticing water drips as melodies) with rhythmic control, though "tinkersong wonder" repetition creates minor voice convergence under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "stitching through the chaos" is a stock metaphor; minor scaffold in "simple yet vast" motivation phrasing prevents 9.0+ despite exceptional density in encoding sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost in machine" trope through specific mechanics (graffiti-encoded pulses, bolt plate key); risk-taking in single-scene climax heightens stakes without obscuring the earned closure.</comment>
