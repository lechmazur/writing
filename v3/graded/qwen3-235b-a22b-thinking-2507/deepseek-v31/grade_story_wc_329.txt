<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's quiet desperation and embodied panic ("cold spike in his chest") drive credible micro-choices under pressure, with contradictory impulses (fear/hope) culminating in the shell-thrust climax. Interiority avoids therapy-speak but slightly over-relies on told motivation early versus shown struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds flawlessly: music's magic triggers statues, chase tightens options, shell-thrust causes decisive change. Cost is visceral—gears cast aside, sterile hum replaced by "profound silence"—with closure's verdant wave reconfiguring the city's ontology under unbroken causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Locust shell (micro-setting) constrains every key choice: found as relic, clutched while fleeing, crumbles to trigger rebirth. Final image ("scent of damp earth and blossom") charges its meaning, while brass automata and sky-bridge details filter through Kael's beauty-focused perception without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize immediately—reawakening beauty versus mechanical sterility—with pressure tightening via statues' interception forcing Kael's final dissonant cry. Agency is pure protagonist choice (shell thrust), and cost is unmistakable: the clockwork heart's violent expulsion reshapes the city's very pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: the locust shell's transformation symbolism pays off in the heart-tree's eruption, while "beauty not reawakened, but reborn" rejects tidy morals. Final image reweights mechanization as suffocating sterility versus organic rebirth without a single abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Kael's selective noticing ("copper coins," "brittle amber" shell), with rhythmic control shifting from lyrical ("note hung like a ghost") to staccato panic ("He fled... violin case banging"). Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: every sentence advances plot or texture ("a shudder... felt in the bones" implies cause before naming it). Figurative language stays sparse yet potent ("twin suns bled into smog"), with final line's "beauty not reawakened, but reborn" avoiding sentimentality through precise diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Trope transformation is masterful: living statues policing orchards become surveillance relics hiding wood beneath stone. Emotional specificity in Kael's "quiet desperation" avoids generic rebellion, while the locust shell's irreplaceable role in the climax synthesizes nature/mechanics into inevitable rebirth.</comment>
