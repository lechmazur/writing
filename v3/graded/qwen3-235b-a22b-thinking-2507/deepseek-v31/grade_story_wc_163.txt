<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grand and laughably obsolete" title) intensifies through embodied despair and the feather's reweighted meaning; micro-choices (bypassing sensors) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the transmission gamble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "learned the rhythm... by finally looking out" reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost (abandoning sky for deep), under Accumulative/Textural lens where polyp pattern break reconfigures dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (burnt feather) charges final image; environment actively constrains choice (ocean pressure as crushing reminder) and becomes the "text itself," with thermal vents directly enabling the climax discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single escalation (instruments failing → bioreceptor gamble) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in "despair closing in" and the transmission's emotional labor, reweighting "rhythm of belonging" from abstract to visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: feather/polyp dance reconfiguration avoids moralizing; "one system, above and below" insight earns resonance via the transmission's quiet hope, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescence of strange fish drifting like untethered souls") modulates with stress; rhythmic control peaks in polyp discovery ("pulse... pattern... cadence") without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("a slow dance of creation and decay" does triple duty); no figurative muddle in climax where syntax tightens ("She scrambled... map this underwater ballet").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "astrologer" in abyss transforms tropes; emotional specificity in "shared exhale spotting fireflies" avoids generic wonder, heightening stakes through irreplaceable feather logic.</comment>
