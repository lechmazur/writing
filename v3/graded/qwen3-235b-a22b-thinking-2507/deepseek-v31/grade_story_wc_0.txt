<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("strip needless drama" vs emerging wonder) acts simultaneously in scene; embodied grief through robotic clearing decaying at wing discovery. Final renunciation of emotional armor earned by dust accumulation with visible cost in "a woman remade."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "left a section open to the sky" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (abandoning preprocessed certainty). Accumulative lens holds through dust-pattern escalation; cost legible in "luminous, accumulating dust" final image reweighting grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust constrains every choice—discovery under terracotta pot, cataloging methodology, final roof decision. Micro-setting (wing fragment) charges closure by transforming "fractures" into renewal. Final image's "luminous dust" reconfigures the greenhouse's meaning with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (scientific detachment vs accepting fragility) tightens through dust accumulation, narrowing options from quantification to archiving renewal. Agency in methodical study drives escalation; cost is felt in abandoned emotional armor and open roof's vulnerability, reweighting grief as "persistent existence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust patterns, not moralizing. Final image ("luminous, accumulating dust") reweights tragedy into continuity without stated moral, resisting tidy binaries. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in "microscopic ridges" and "gold smudge" particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision ("nanostructured ridges") melting into poetic observation ("a cosmos"). Rhythm modulates from clipped early sentences to flowing cadence at "gentle insurgency," with patterned diction ("dust," "fractures") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sodden, silent world" and "luminous dust" exemplify high-density specificity. Figurative language ("dust held secrets of gravity") serves theme without muddling. Final paragraph's cadence accelerates perfectly into closure with "fractures and luminous dust" reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through scientific lens—butterfly dust as "different gravity" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in making dust the active agent succeeds; emotional truth emerges from "terracotta pot" and "nasturtium leaf" verifiable details rather than abstraction.</comment>
