<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eliza's interiority shines through embodied choices (zither handling, breath guidance), but Leo's "unlearning hatred" lacks concrete micro-choices beyond vocal softening; his transformation leans slightly on thematic convenience rather than character-specific struggle visible in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"resonant silence they now knew how to fill" crystallizes the cost of the program's end with undeniable conceptual weight under Accumulative/Textural lens; minor deduction as "traveled stillness" motif arrives post-40% without early setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Velvet library’s sensory details (autumn light, crimson upholstery) create atmosphere but don’t constrain choices; zither rosette functions as indispensable micro-setting charging the climax, yet the named setting itself remains postcard-like without active pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Eliza’s agency as she isolates altos and guides Leo’s breath—each subtraction forecloses options while escalating the "vanishing arts" cost; the felt price of the program’s end permeates the final harmony’s quiet victory without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the choir’s physical labor—"harmony through subtraction" crystallized in the seamless round—avoiding moralizing; the final silence reweights "vanishing art" as enduring resonance, fulfilling Conceptual Repricing without a single abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("traveled stillness," "mosaic of apprehension") sustains under pressure, but elevated diction like "remnant of unlearning hatred" briefly clashes with Eliza’s voice in peak tension, edging toward therapy-speak without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor paraphrase loop ("quiet erasure of one more vanishing art, a subtraction from the world’s dwindling harmony") slightly dilutes density in a high-pressure beat, costing 0.3 per Overwriting Checks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "dying arts" trope through vocal pedagogy specificity—the rosette/breath metaphor feels inevitable, not ornamental; risk-taking in making silence the protagonist heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional truth in the bittersweet payoff.</comment>
