<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (static guardian vs. compelled intervener) drive Elara's pivotal choice; Kael's embodied desperation ("words frosting") avoids label-only fear. Final renunciation of isolation has visible cost in "battered" village and altered duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "battered, remained" and "symbol of future chose" crystallize cost under causal lens. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("lighthouse orchard, shifting ice floes"), and causal chain (intrusion→mirror vision→mobilization) narrows options relentlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard constrains Elara's initial inaction; crystal fragment's "cold and dead" texture charges the final image. Sensory details ("salt-bleached town," "dust of centuries") reflect urgency shifts—crisis narrows to "frosted" words while calmer moments admit "murky portals."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ice floe/cliff threat) tightens into avalanche timeline via Elara's agency. Pressure coheres causally: mirror reconstruction directly enables village mobilization. Cost is unmistakable—"battered, remained" and expended effort—reconfiguring her "static peace" understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "map empathy onto action" dramatized in villagers moving loved ones to high ground. Final image reweights the crystal fragment as "symbol of future chose," offering non-literal answer to "what is peace?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("shadow-laced," "prismatic light") reflects Elara's guardian role. Rhythm modulates perfectly: short sentences for avalanche ("They had the map. Now for the action") contrast lyrical mirror sequence. Compression in vision-weaving taught early and paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silent scream frozen in glass" exemplifies triple-duty density. Final line recharges crystal motif without muddle. Figurative language ("streak of determined night") serves clarity in high-pressure beats—no artifacts dull closure's "battered, remained" cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "peacekeeper who must leave her post" transformed via mirror vision-weaving. Emotional truth in Kael's "raw, courageous anomaly" avoids trope. Specific lighthouse-oracle logic resists swappability—changing setting would break causal chain.</comment>
