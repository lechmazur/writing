<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s weariness is embodied (“too weary to question”), but her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses beyond exhaustion; Eli’s motivation is clear but his “melancholy” remains abstract without specific tradeoffs in the pivotal rowing choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: Lena rowing toward the light with “life already transposing” crystallizes the cost of leaving her old existence; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse micro-setting constrains Lena’s choice (she sees the signal and acts), while the microdot film’s mechanics charge the final image; sensory details like “flour-dusted room” and “rain-streaked window” serve urgency without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (Lena’s trapped life) tighten when the lighthouse signal appears, forcing her to choose; the cost—leaving her known misery—is felt in “uncertain, beautiful key,” but the transition lacks visceral friction under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lighthouse’s musical signal as “permission slip,” avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights “open secrets” as earned opportunity without stating a lesson, fulfilling the non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eli’s musical metaphors (“sad, repetitive melody,” “new key”) create a distinct perceptual signature; rhythm modulates from contemplative (“hollow ringing”) to urgent (“complex chord”) without POV slippage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor cliché (“sad, repetitive melody”) slightly dulls specificity, but propulsion remains clean; no loops or artifacts in peak beats, with final line (“cryptic truth known only to the night”) delivering layered closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms fortune-teller trope via spycraft precision and musical lighthouse signals; risks sentimentality but anchors universality in concrete details like microdot film, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
