<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (fear of exposure vs. conviction in garden's memory) drive her marble-revealing climax. Slight over-articulation of "wisely pragmatic" borders on diagnostic label-speak but doesn't undermine her embodied choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Cederic's silent nod crystallizes the garden's value with visible cost in Elara's "blooming withering" exhalation. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden mechanics (wires, dyes) actively constrain Elara's deception tactics. Final marble-light image charges closure by reweighting "blooming withering" as embodied cost. Micro-setting (marbles) is indispensable to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: Cederic's meter declaration forces Elara's revelation choice. Cost is visceral in her clenched heart and later exhalation, foreclosing secrecy while saving the garden's purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: cracked marbles and dyed hedges avoid moralizing. Final image reweights "mended deception" as deeper truth without stated moral, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "back was a question mark," "rustle of dry leaves" voice. Syntax modulates under stress (short clauses during confrontation). Cederic's clinical diction vs. Elara's tactile language creates intentional dissonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "blooming withering" recharges as fresh oxymoron. Only microscopic flaw: "mended deception that revealed a deeper truth" slightly over-explains where imagery suffices, but untouched by closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms decline trope via specific mechanics (dye injections, crack-pattern marbles). "Mended deception" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with emotional truth in broken beauty resisting sentimentality.</comment>
