<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "trembling hands/steady voice" and embodied dread; micro-choices like questioning stanzas reveal her librarian’s precision under pressure. Final choice to pull the nail earns closure through prior decoding work, though "nervously confident" leans slightly told versus shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the nail-pull crystallizes options (past honored/future work begins) with conceptual cost—idealism hardened into mandate via "weight of copper." Accumulative lens holds through dread’s evolution; cost legible in "vessel for his vindication" becoming active burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Weather station’s "spongey dread" evolves from oppressive force to settled release, constraining choices (rusted hatch, basement descent) and charging the final image—warm nail as tether. Micro-setting (copper nail) proves indispensable, though "concrete blister" risks cliché but redeems via visceral payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively: decoding stanzas narrows options to ritual nail-pull, with conceptual cost made undeniable as "mandate" replaces naive idealism. Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency (methodical search → questioning entries), though jet stream shift lacks temporal urgency beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—quiet defiance versus corporate falsification—with final map reframing "voyages through time" as non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; "librarian turned cartographer" slightly on-the-nose but redeemed by action. Cost crystallizes in "anchored by purpose" versus earlier dread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via librarian’s mind ("parsing lyrical descriptions," "rhythmic patterns hide plea"), with syntax tightening under stress ("She wrapped her fingers..."). Minor register drift in "spongey dread," but voice modulates effectively from methodical to awed during ritual climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("shriek of protesting stone," "ozone and damp earth"). Final image’s "wind felt different" recharges opening perfectly. One near-duplicate ("dread... settled, anxious potential spent") barely dents otherwise flawless rhythm and sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate crisis and ancestral redemption via mapmaking: "reversible exile" as custodianship (not banishment) transforms exile tropes. Emotional truth in quiet defiance avoids sentimentality; specificity (copper nail from coffin, shipwrecked journals) grounds universals without quirks.</comment>
