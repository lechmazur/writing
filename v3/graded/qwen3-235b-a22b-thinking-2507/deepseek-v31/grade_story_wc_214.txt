<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Orion's "borrowed catharsis" versus trembling hands, but "strength in vulnerability" edges toward label-speak without sufficient embodied friction during the AI confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with the AI's "Ah" crystallizing the shift from tracking to witnessing; cost is legible in Orion's prior physical/emotional depletion and the station's purpose reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining choices when pressed to the terminal and charging the final image; "mirror-finish deck" detail pays off through tactile reflection of cosmic observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (witnessing vs recording) tightens through Orion's nightly tracings, narrowing options to the AI integration; cost is visceral (trembling hands) and conceptual (redefining the station's purpose) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "universe forever falling, forever whole" earns thematic resonance through accumulated star-paths without moralizing; avoids Thematic Echo by making wisdom emerge from traced meteor trails.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("broom whispering against metal," "cosmic dust glowing with primal elegance") modulates from hushed observation to wondrous climax; AI's shift from "cold alert" to "Ah" shows brilliant voice evolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied sentence rhythms matching contemplative tone; minor register drift in "silent, burning joy" risks sentimentality but is redeemed by concrete physical stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "wise janitor" trope through tactile physics (meteor paths as cosmic dust trails) and the glass's warmth; emotional truth in reframing vulnerability as strength avoids generic templates.</comment>
