<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn’s cheerful gloom is embodied via micro-choices (whistling amid frustration) and contradictory impulses (obsession vs. clearing his head). Motivation intensifies credibly to the seed investigation, but minor abstraction in "profound gloom" slightly dilutes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "He couldn’t stop the forgetting, but he could now faithfully document..." Orientation is crisp by 100 words. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via evaporating emotions until the seed’s revelation reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystal geode’s prisms actively constrain Finn’s work (fracturing light for emotion-reading), while crater glass evolves from tool to truth-revealer. Final image of documenting the landslide charges the setting’s iridescence with irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths disappear) tightens via Finn’s agency—the seed investigation narrows options to documenting the cataclysm. Conceptual cost (powerlessness against forgetting) is unmistakable in the closure beat, though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: evaporating foam, the landslide of forgetting. Final image—"the story of the disappearance would, itself, never be lost"—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("sapphire blues of contentment," "angry crimson flares"), with syntax modulating under pressure. Minor register drift in "conjecture" slightly jars, but rhythmic control during the seed revelation sustains tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters with adjacent paraphrase loops ("maddening gaps... frustrating gaps"), dulling momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but scaffold in reflection ("chief motivation... obsession") caps high-band eligibility per Text-Artifact rule.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes via "landslide of forgetting" and sea-foam mechanics. Emotional specificity (paternal love evaporating) avoids genericity, though the bird-seed device edges toward convenient revelation without deeper world logic.</comment>
