<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "calmly fierce resolution" amid trembling hands; "confidently uncertain" trait manifests through inventorying facts versus emotional collapse. Final choice earned by Leo's letters reconfiguring his purpose with felt cost of past avoidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each discovered object (speaker cloth, case, letters) deepens stakes until Charged Poise closure where "purpose... clear" reweights his appraisal work with conceptual cost of unfulfilled lives. Orientation clear by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quarry micro-setting actively constrains choices: rock-dust foreman assigns inventory, rust cathedral forces physical discovery of case, and speaker cloth on desk charges final image. Sensory details ("ghosts of diesel," adhesive residue) reflect urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming purpose after failure) tightens through quarry inventory assignment and letter discovery. Cost crystallizes in "preserving their stories" realization, but coincidence in finding Leo's case slightly undermines agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"After the applause" theme emerges through concrete particulars: speaker cloth's adhesive residue, "Echo Valley Longing" sheet music. Final image reweights appraisal work as story-preservation without moralizing—thematic answer resonates via "calmly fierce resolution" charging prior shame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("synaptic echo of load-ins," inventorying polyester blend) modulates perfectly under stress. Rhythmic control shifts from staccato TV shame to flowing letter discovery. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style clean in "He was meant to be working."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("metallic taste of public failure," "cathedral of rust and silence"). Only deduction: "insulating emotionally with facts" borders on label-speak but redeemed by immediate concrete demonstration through inventory behavior.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms rockstar cliché via roadie-turned-appraiser lens; specificity of "Marshall cabinets" and quarry foreman's rock-dust knuckles grounds universality. Risk-taking in quiet closure where purpose emerges from preserving unfulfilled stories, not grand gesture.</comment>
