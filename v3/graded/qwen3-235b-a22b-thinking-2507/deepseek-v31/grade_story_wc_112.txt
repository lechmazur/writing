<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in Aris's obsession; Vesh's shift from skepticism to awe is embodied but no visible cost for Aris weakens the earned change. Micro-choices like the lever adjustment show value hierarchy but insufficient internal conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost ("universe shifted sideways"), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Vesh's "Wait" intervention drives the pivotal turn, not Aris's choices. Orientation anchors within 120 words satisfy the test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aviary details ("scent of loam," "ghost-song") create vivid atmosphere, yet the xenobiology setting remains decorative. The nexus constrains one choice (lever adjustment) but fails to charge the final image sufficiently for 8.5+ eligibility despite strong sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (proving sideways time) tighten via the avian's acknowledgment, creating undeniable conceptual cost. Escalation relies on Vesh's agency ("Wait") rather than Aris's, limiting pressure depth. The single deepening meets scope requirements but lacks visible price charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the avian's gaze reweighting time's nature, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("universe shifted sideways") offers resonant non-literal answer, but "subdued awakenings" isn't dramatized as stake—Vesh's internal shift lacks tactical consequences for full 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures (Aris's mechanical focus, Vesh's scientific lens) modulate effectively under pressure. Minor filter-verb use ("his scientific mind wrestling") is voice-motivated, but rhythmic control lacks the precision for 8.8+ in high-stakes beats like the avian's gaze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean with zero loops or scaffold; "mechanically warm hum rising in pitch" demonstrates textural specificity. Slight over-modification in "dawning comprehension that was quiet, profound, and deeply unsettling" prevents 9.0, but propulsion remains flawless through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time theory with xenobiology elevates trope, yet "sideways time" premise lacks non-obvious moral calculus. The avian's acknowledgment provides earned risk-taking, but emotional specificity doesn't transcend familiar paradigm-shift templates for higher band.</comment>
