<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "reluctance" summarized not embodied until climax. Micro-choices lack hierarchy pre-crisis despite strong closure causality ("stepped forward to change").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Decisive Change with legible cost ("he was remade") under Causal lens. Rift creation → intervention → timeline splintering forms unbroken because/therefore chain to earned transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard constrains choice (spice ritual requires star-fruit location) and charges final image (Kael coalescing in branches). "Captured stars" fruit shifts from memory trigger to reunion site with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: memory → spice casting → rift → decisive step. Cost ("remade") reweights final image. "Reluctant metamorphosis" stake signaled early but internal conflict lacks sufficient pre-climax friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics: "doorway not dwelling" reframed by spice ritual and timeline splintering. Final coalescence answers central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silvered petals glowing with internal light", "cold, silver fire") modulates rhythm under pressure. "Cosmic intimacy" slightly abstract but redeemed by sensory precision in rift sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("not to shut out... but to feel it more deeply"). Figurative language stays coherent ("scent of rare spices—pungent, sweet, smoky") with no closure muddle. High propulsion through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope via spice-based memory mechanics. Emotional truth in "hindsight hesitation" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off through sensory integration.</comment>
