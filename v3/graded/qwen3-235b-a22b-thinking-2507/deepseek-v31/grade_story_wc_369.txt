<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between technician duty and private quest is clear but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak moments; the epiphany about trees' sacrifice feels earned through embodied cost ("sorrow... suddenly feeling lighter").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with visible cost in her mother's memory; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase (scattered dreams → arboreal memory) without causality breaks. Orientation anchors by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sextant functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (waiting for moonlight) and charges the final image; sensory details like "oilskin jacket rustle" reflect urgency while "wind-driven rain" affects action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (angling sextant, focusing dials) with felt cost in shifted understanding; the "pin drop" timing creates legitimate pressure but borders on convenient coincidence at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (child's balloon, baking bread scent) with no moralizing; final realization "some things are not meant to be fixed, only held" reweights prior material non-literally through arboreal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quantified sorrow," "brass-trimmed gauge") modulates under pressure; slight register drift in "private seed buried deep" avoids therapy-speak but lacks deeper voice evolution during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("silent, hedged corridors" → "silent west corridor"); otherwise high density with strategic telling ("just a job" compresses backstory) and rhythm variation supporting emotional escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of labyrinth trope through grief-measurement lens; risk-taking in conceptual repricing (sanctuary vs prison) feels inevitable through prior particulars without gimmickry.</comment>
