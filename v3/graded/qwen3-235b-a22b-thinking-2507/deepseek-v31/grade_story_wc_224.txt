<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (seeking truth while needing relief) act in-scene through tactile micro-choices; her earned endurance as "reader" forecloses victimhood with conceptual cost. Alistair's sparse presence avoids functionalism via distinct voice ("rustling pages").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise RR: "she was not a passive victim... a reader" crystallizes stance shift with undeniable cost ("hidden thunder... no longer a threat"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, though the "thunder" metaphor slightly over-clarifies the earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bookstore functions as vital micro-setting: specific textures (wood grain, feather barbs) constrain navigation choices, while the stone's "woven roots" pedestal charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure (tactile focus during vision hunt), avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (enduring truth to grasp "home") tightens through one meaningful deepening: visions shift from "hollowed out" to "trace contours" via stone/feather. Agency-driven escalation reweights options under Accumulative lens, though the transition lacks a visceral "point of no return" beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reframing: "brutal reality... raw material" becomes "foundational hum," with final image ("sound of the world’s heart... shape of home") offering non-literal resolution. Zero moralizing; complexity intact as truth remains painful but meaningful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: reality as "aching, true form," feather barbs "impossibly soft yet precise." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—fragmented during visions ("The revelations came..."), lyrical at climax—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("consciousness substituted reality with brutal, clarifying sight" does triple duty). Final line’s "rhythm as the shape of home" crystallizes theme without muddle. One near-slip: "hidden thunder" risks over-explaining the earned shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "mercury-glass seer" reframes truth-seeing as physical attribute, while "shape of home" avoids abstraction via mountain-library metaphor. Emotional truth in "home is not soft lies" transforms quest tropes through sensory recalibration.</comment>
