<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in mask-slipping moment elevates beyond victim/silenced duality; "cartography of scars" risks diagnostic label-speak but embodied via photo development. Micro-choices (timer handling, fixer tray grip) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: blackout's cost (identity shift) crystallizes options in final image. Power outage tightens pressure meaningfully; cost proof evident in "scars were a topography of resistance" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Darkroom timer functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (development timing) and charges closure; storm actively pressures action via blackout. Sensory selection (chemical coolness, timer clicks) reflects urgency without checklist overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. discovery risk) tightens through storm-induced blackout, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is conceptual (shedding victim identity) and unmistakable in "map she was finally ready to navigate" reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through photographic process: scars as navigable terrain avoids moralizing. Final image ("coordinate" not lament) offers resonant answer to central question without stated moral, rejecting tidy binaries about loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via scientific-poetic duality ("lightening veined the clouds," chemical precision), though "cartography of scars" slightly drifts from plausible lexicon. Rhythmic control under stress (shortened syntax in blackout) avoids ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Cartography of scars" triggers Patterned-artifact penalty (-0.4) as therapy-speak in peak beat, but no loops or scaffold. Prose otherwise achieves high density ("ghosts of words began to appear") with closure image sharpened by concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship via photographic negatives transforms trope; "scars as topography" feels earned through darkroom mechanics. Emotional specificity avoids abstraction, with observatory setting resisting generic dystopian templates.</comment>
