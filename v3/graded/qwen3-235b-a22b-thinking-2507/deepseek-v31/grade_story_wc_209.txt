<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete actions (tracing postcards, precise movements) shows contradictory impulses—artistic drive vs emotional void—but lacks mid-crisis irrationality. Final choice to reinvent mural earns closure through prior causality, though emotional progression edges toward tidiness in the cathedral revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: "dawning hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to symbol of resolution. Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (shift from "hollow space" to "heart finally full"), but patron’s cathedral suggestion risks convenient causality despite thematic integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Postcards function as micro-setting—constraining choices (pausing work to trace them) and charging the final image (opening box "with gratitude"). Pavillion’s amber light evolves with plot, mirroring Elara’s internal shift from winter to autumn. Environment shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: venturing to cathedral risks "foolishness," and the sunlight revelation narrows options (repair → reinvent). Cost is visceral—emotional shift from emptiness to peace—made legible when postcards transform from "untold stories" to "gratitude," altering her artistic stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: moon’s pull on flowers mirrors grandmother’s distant influence, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("nocturnal flower turning toward the moon") reweights the central question without stating a moral, earning resonance through concrete action (painting the cosmic diagram).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soul a kaleidoscope of unspent color") modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during cathedral tension ("She felt a pang of foolishness, until..."). No head-hopping; rhythm accelerates with revelation ("breathless, as the light passed"), taught patterns pay off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dawning hush" reprise deepens meaning without redundancy. Figurative language ("gravitational love") stays grounded in physical action (sunlight on glass). Final line’s "tender embrace" charges closure with precise texture, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms artist-reckoning trope through specific, lived detail: etched glass mechanics, postcards as "stamps were exotic blooms." Emotional truth in linking moon tides to grandmother’s influence feels fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
