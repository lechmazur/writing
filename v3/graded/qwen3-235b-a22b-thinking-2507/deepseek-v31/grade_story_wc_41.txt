<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands trembling not with age, but with anticipation of it," embodying the tension between her quest and inevitable forgetting. Flaws feel earned through her method (trusting driftwood markers), though motivation's abstract nature slightly blurs causal urgency at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "she did not understand them, but a profound and sorrowful pull drew her gaze" crystallizes her futile endurance with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with density tightening through the chalk's futile gesture and fading marks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (driftwood markers navigate mist, chalk fades on sculptures) and charges the final image—the unwound tape "silent, holding everything" against the ephemeral fog. Environment actively shapes tactics and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: her method (driftwood/chalk) creates the path to the plinth, then the vision's loss forces renunciation. The cost—"leaving only the tidal longing, vast and empty"—is visceral and legible under the Accumulative lens, reweighting her entire quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chalk marks beading with moisture reprise "clinging to echoes," while the silent tape offers a resonant, non-literal answer to capturing time's sound. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in her forgotten purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("air thick with ghosts of shapes," "fish slipping through hands"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (e.g., fragmented "She simply stood, and listened"). Minor register drift in "singular, strange compulsion" slightly dilutes voice in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density and propulsion, but "clinging to echoes, building a path out of whispers" risks slight overwriting in a pivotal beat. No loops or scaffold, though "persistent, clammy mist" borders on redundant texture without advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through specific, grounded choices: precognitive forgetfulness isn't gimmickry but shapes every action (e.g., trusting left-turn markers). Emotional truth in "anticipation of [age]" avoids abstraction, though "tidal longing" borders on familiar phrasing.</comment>
