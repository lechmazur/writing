<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rio's interior contradiction ("dual allegiance") manifests in embodied choices: the chip's warmth, graffiti's intuitive mapping, and the net-mender's organic response prove motivation. No therapy-speak; desperation/hope physically pierce her. Minor deduction for slightly neat epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "bridge" realization crystallizes stance with felt cost ("desperation still there, but hope... louder"). Accumulative lens holds—seven graffiti pieces tighten pressure. Net-mender's appearance risks convenience but is earned by prior community reactions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (foundation stone chip) constrains choice and charges final image ("firm pressure in her pocket"). Carnival's sensory assault (neon, fried dough) narrows perception under stress, guiding Rio's dampening reflexes. No generic placeholders; every detail pressures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Rio's agency: Elias's warning → graffiti campaign → organic community shift ("maybe it could be both"). Cost is legible in "fragile hope pierce[ing] desperation" and the chip's persistent weight. Dominant gentrification stake tightens once via the net-mender's proposal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the maze-shaped chip reweights "root" as active bridge, not passive memory. Final image ("dance upon new currents... feet remembering old rhythms") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "senses automatically dampening neon assault" filters setting through Rio's "culture shock absorber" trait. Rhythm modulates from serene graffiti strokes to crystalline hope. "Hopeful desperation" phrase slightly on-the-nose but redeemed by physicality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "orderly mind composing an intuitive map of defiance" slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise clean: "screaming rides swallow reflection" avoids cliché; sentence variation supports pressure. No closure artifacts, but "potent, humming mix" edges toward overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via coded graffiti as cultural reorganization tool. Specifics (net-menders' guild star, third-dock waves) resist generality. Risk-taking in quiet closure—Earned Stasis through community dialogue, not confrontation—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
