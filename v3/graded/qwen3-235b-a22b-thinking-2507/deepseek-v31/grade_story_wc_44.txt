<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "truth settling" summary replaces embodied cost. Micro-choices like key insertion lack visible tradeoffs despite deliberate framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands but cost legibility fails: "world was broken but mending" softens stakes without felt consequence. Solstice revelation lacks on-page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Observatory’s humming air and automaton constrain choices via key mechanics. Final "strangely close sky" charges the image but environment doesn’t actively shape tactics beyond set dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake tightening via reconstruction is driven by agency, yet escalation lacks meaningful cost escalation. Weeks-long montage flattens pressure; no tactical shift from lost time or resources.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through refraction formula and shadow inversion. Final "mending itself" line edges toward thematic echo, slightly softening conceptual cost of perpetual brokenness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows no longer behaved as they should") with rhythmic control in activation scene. Consistent tense and lexicon avoid stress-induced voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density in "shimmering fabric of light and law" projection. Final line avoids sentimentality but "truth settling" slightly over-tells emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Spoons bending reality" transforms mundane into fresh premise, yet emotional arc follows predictable scholarly revelation template without bold risk-taking.</comment>
