<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "abrasive calm" to "furious peace" shift; embodied epiphany when Elias realizes the plague "finished off a wounded one" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice to descend with the cog reveals hierarchy of truth over safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "restart the clock of history with truth" crystallizes stance after the chronometer’s impact scar shatters state narrative. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sedimentary descent tightens knowledge with each stratum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chronometer cog constrains choice and charges closure: its sharp teeth contrast decay, driving Elias’s descent; final image of writing to "restart the clock" reweights it as a tool of revolution. Sensory specificity in "slime-coated libraries" and "mammoth stones" avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency—his sedimentary method forces confrontation with the impact scar, narrowing options to rewrite history or accept state lies. Conceptual cost lands when he grasps the plague "merely the final infection in a corpse already dead," altering his mission’s urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cog’s transformation from artifact to "shattered time" symbol; final line’s "restart the clock of history with truth" offers non-literal answer to "competing narratives" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elias notices "machined surface" precision amid decay, reflecting his philosophical lens. Voice modulates from clinical ("epistemological frameworks") to visceral ("furious peace") under pressure, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silt and silence" to "furious peace" shows rhythmic control. Figurative language ("clock of history") serves closure without muddle. Final line’s propulsion—"turned and began his descent back home, to write"—avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archaeological method as rebellion: sedimentary descent isn’t trope but character-specific lens that reconfigures catastrophe. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "wounded civilization" premise avoids Wikipedia-voice.</comment>
