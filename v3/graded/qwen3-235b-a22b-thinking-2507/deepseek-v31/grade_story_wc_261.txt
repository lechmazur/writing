<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("closure seeker who only knew how to open wounds") drives the epiphany; embodied cost in shaking hands and bandage unwrapping replaces abstract insight; micro-choice hierarchy crystallized through scar reinterpretation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "The story was not in the cut, but in the knit" reconfigures her entire epistemology; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to final unwrapping beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bandaged arm functions as micro-setting that charges closure; coffee ring’s physicality ("dark, lopsided") and hourglass constrain choices; sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects surgical trauma narrowing perception to immediate textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reading scars as truth) tightens via displaced miracle revelation; agency in mental tunneling forecloses old interpretation with felt cost ("hers held only an absence"); single deepening reshapes knowledge under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar reinterpretation as "seals" of healing; avoids moralizing by making wisdom concrete ("earned and honest"); final ivy memory offers non-literal answer to displacement anxiety without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("resonant pain... phantom limb of memory") with stress-appropriate compression; lyrical compression taught early via hourglass/coffee ring motifs; no head-hopping despite telepathic elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("ivory’s perception her guide through the soil and stone" avoids filter verbs); minor density issue in "phantom limb of memory" metaphor risks abstraction in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "displaced miracle" trope through medical specificity; emotional truth in healing as "earned and honest" avoids sentimentality; fresh synthesis of surgical reality and metaphysical absence.</comment>
