<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "daringly methodical" approach masking inner churn, but medication backstory lacks embodied cost during peak beats. Final choice to walk the river path earns closure through prior causality, though "unbuffered mind" edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "mended and patched, but whole" crystallizes options with visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; density intensifies via river/map metaphors without causality breaks. Orientation anchored by word 40 with "disused railway station."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station and accordion bellows directly constrain choices—Elara's discovery hinges on decaying infrastructure. Final image of "patched" instrument charging her resolve satisfies 9+ gate. Sensory details ("brittle folded paper," "peeling silver tape") filter through chronicler's precise perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens meaningfully when map reveals "eddies of regret," forcing Elara to trade cartography for embodied action. Cost is visceral in "path would be long," but medication timeframe lacks pressure escalation beyond initial setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "The first map is the one you drew yourself. The last is the one you forgive" reweights river metaphors without moralizing. Final image of walking the path offers non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("chronicler of rivers") shapes all description; syntax mirrors Elara's methodical nature. Old man's dialogue carries subtext through "It only plays one song now," but minor register drift in "cartographer’s code" slightly exceeds her lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "shattered spine" and "porcelain temples" demonstrate textural specificity. Near-synonym churn in "flooded unbuffered mind" (para 1/3) costs -0.2, but closure image ("mended and patched, but whole") achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "self-forgiveness quest" trope through river cartography lens. Every detail serves conflict: bathroom graffiti as "porcelain temples" reframes vulnerability. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making closure feel inevitable.</comment>
