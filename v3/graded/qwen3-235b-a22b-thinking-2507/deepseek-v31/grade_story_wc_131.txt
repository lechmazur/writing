<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing but 'quiet ache' edges toward abstraction. Final choice earned through sensory trail, though contradictory impulses could deepen under pressure. Micro-choices in panel discovery reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in continued invisibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost in 'she would remain unseen, but her action would be seen.' Orientation flawless by line 5; Accumulative lens taught early via sensory breadcrumbs holds through sparrow's chirp breaking the hush. No causality breaks in discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library's pipes and sapphire hush function as micro-setting constraining movement and charging final image. Sensory selection reflects urgency—dust and cold iron in crisis, dawn's blue light for revelation. Recurring 'hush' evolves from silence to charged atmosphere without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs secrecy) signaled immediately via blackout's 'domain' metaphor. Escalation driven by sensory accumulation: tape fragment's grief memory narrows options to box discovery. Cost crystallized in final line's 'truly visible' paradox, legible through Elara's embodied action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'catalyst' fragment charging final arrangement—not stated. Ending reweights 'visible' via action (papers on desk) not personhood, avoiding moralizing. Conceptual cost of invisibility as solution resonates through sparrow's chirp breaking silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature sharp: 'warped floorboard by touch' filters library through crawl-space expertise. Rhythm modulates from methodical ('kindly patient') to urgent ('time was short') without head-hopping. Elision of backstory taught via 'familiar and alien' tactile discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'sapphire hush' repetition functions as patterned lyric anchor. Sentence rhythm varies—short staccato for discovery ('Time was short'), flowing for revelation. 'Faltering heartbeat' metaphor extends blackout's physicality without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms 'hidden document' trope through sensory memory mechanics. Fresh inflection in 'solution not person' motivation; specificity of ferromagnetic tape grounds universality. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though motivation synthesis could deepen.</comment>
