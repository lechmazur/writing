<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("heart frantic drum/mind calm sea"), but motivation for "fortress" remains abstract without concrete stakes. Flawed competence shown via pavement-crack analysis, though emotional cost lacks specificity beyond tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with "trembled with the certainty" crystallizing cost. Orientation anchored by paragraph one; Accumulative lens holds as mist/arrows/vault deepen mystery without causal gaps. Punch mechanics slightly under-explained but closure transcends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist, dew-glistened cracks, and ozone-scented air actively constrain choices (arrow navigation, punch illumination). Vault setting charges final image with "shelves stretching into infinity" – environment directly shapes the closure’s weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via deepening (cracks→doors→library) under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in "trembled with certainty," but dominant stake ("fortress") lacks concrete dramatization beyond abstract yearning. Agency strong, yet emotional price remains oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mapped lines vs. phantom punch, dew arrows vs. keyhole doors. Final library image answers "unspoken truths" quest non-literally, but moral ambiguity feels thin – no counter-readings of truth’s cost deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("watercolor clouds," "sound waves as visual scores") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in vault discovery ("cold silk," "sigh echoed"). Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored to Elara’s cartographic lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "trembling certainty" reused verbatim. Otherwise pristine propulsion – "pushing through a membrane of cold silk" avoids purple prose. Final line’s "trembled with the certainty" delivers closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden library" trope via cartographer’s lens: punch-hole key, dew arrows, star charts. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "bad habits expiring/new starts igniting" avoids generic wonder.</comment>
