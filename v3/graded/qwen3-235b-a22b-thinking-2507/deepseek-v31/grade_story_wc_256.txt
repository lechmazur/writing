<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hollow" data vs. soulful connection) drives choice; embodied emotion in vocal responses to sounds; final endurance of vulnerability earns cost through prior causality. Micro-choice of inserting self into sequence reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: child's laughter reconfigures "texture of connection" with conceptual cost of vulnerability. Accumulative lens holds—density increase (conversing with sounds) reweights dominant stake. Cost legible in "space between them" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Miner's lamp lens constrains choice (framing servers) and charges final image (holding light steady during song). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: gravel crunch deepened by hum, wind met with "golden shadows" harmonic. Micro-setting drives closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: realizing pilgrimage needs "guide not conductor" deepens knowledge. Dominant stake (soulful connection) tightens when archived sounds respond to her song. Cost (vulnerability) legible in "resonant space between them" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "space between sounds" as resonant answer to "texture of connection." Final image (laughter echoing bell tone) reweights pilgrimage without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—child's laughter embodies connection, never stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "golden shadows" harmonic reframes sound through artist’s bias. Rhythmic control under pressure—short phrases during gravel crunch, lyrical flow at climax. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crunch of gravel" met with "soft low hum" exemplifies dual-purpose prose. Strategic telling compresses backstory ("digital collapse") without momentum loss. Final line ("alive, and it waited") resolves with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "artificial pilgrimage" transformed via sonic vulnerability. Emotional truth in "questioning notes" redefining connection. Avoids tropes—miner’s lens as thought-focalizer, not sentimental relic. Risk heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
