<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines via charcoal-dusted hands and "granular" purpose, but "steadily adaptive" is stated not shown through tradeoffs. Final choice earned by frost archaeology, though contradictions in her artist/survivor duality could deepen under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (exposing toxin), but relay discovery feels slightly convenient. Orientation clear by 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through frost patterns reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canyon actively constrains choices—frost reveals ledger, silence amplifies signal. Final image (lens broadcasting truth) recharges "drifting resonance" with undeniable environmental cost, hitting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via frost patterns narrows options meaningfully, but ecological toxin shift lacks early signaling. Dominant stake (personal survival) transforms organically, though secondary stake integration feels slightly rushed at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass/light motifs reweighted by "luminous for all to see" climax—no moralizing. Final image answers central question by making poison visible, avoiding thematic echo with earned conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice distinct via artist’s perceptual signature ("coaxed light from silica"), rhythmic control under stress. Frost patterns taught early; no head-hopping. Slight uniformity in reflective passages prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minimal scaffold—only "steadily adaptive" repetition weakens momentum. Final line’s propulsion flawless, but adjacent synonym loops ("slow repair," "slow, patient archaeology") trigger −0.3 per Q7 artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artist-as-avenger through glass/light mechanics. Canyon setting transforms trope; risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Near-echo of eco-thriller tropes slightly tempers originality.</comment>
