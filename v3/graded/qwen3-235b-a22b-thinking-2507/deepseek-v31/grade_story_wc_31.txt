<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (hiding vs. seeking) drives action, but epiphany lacks sufficient prior groundwork for full earnedness; the vow's explicit phrasing risks thematic echo without deeper character-specific processing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the vow reweights "color of sound" with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor lens slippage as coincidence (key fitting drawer) slightly undermines Accumulative pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (diving, navigating) and charges the final image, though "Grand Nautilus Hotel" proper noun lacks integration beyond plot function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Silas's agency (repeated dives), but escalation lacks visceral resistance; the vow resolves the conflict almost magically without prior struggle against his hiding instinct.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the algae's glow redefining "color of sound," avoiding moralizing. Slight thematic echo in the vow's explicit "light that cannot be drowned" borders on overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/shadow focus) and rhythmic control shine, but "meteor hush" and "fused in his mind" moments lapse into generic diction inconsistent with Silas's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but minor cadence issues ("surfaced for air, then dove again") and the vow's slightly clichéd phrasing prevent 8.8+. Final line's propulsion compensates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and maritime decay feels inevitable; bioluminescent algae as thematic engine transforms familiar tropes. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality while risking predictable payoff.</comment>
