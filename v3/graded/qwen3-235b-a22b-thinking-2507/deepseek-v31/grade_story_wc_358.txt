<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied expertise drives micro-choices: metallic dust test reveals wind anomaly, patch triggers visceral "pulse quickened" realization. Motivation ("cultivate foresight") shown through wind experiment, not told. Minor deduction for slightly over-explained Arcadia backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Vale transmitting countermeasures as "shimmering air seemed to pulse," cost legible in "voice a rasp." Causal lens holds flawlessly—wind test → bird → patch → hypothesis → intervention. Orientation clear by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain action: "canyon-like corridors" create wind patterns she tests, form circular arena for climax. "Hazy precision" air quality affects perception and tactics. Final "steel canyon" image charges closure with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent convergence) tightens through Vale’s agency: wind documentation → patch realization → transmission of countermeasures. Cost felt in physical toll ("voice a rasp") and unstable event. Escalation driven by causal expertise, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "cultivate foresight" embodied in wind test and transmission, not stated. Final image ("words the only weapon") reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "nascent heart" still threatening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: professional lexicon ("aerodynamics," "damping resonance") filtered through sensory urgency ("stiff object," "woolen blanket smothering"). Stress compresses syntax ("mind racing ahead of her feet") without POV slippage. "Nascent heart" crystallizes tone shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "warped lens" metaphor stays coherent under pressure. Final line recharges "steel canyon" motif while advancing stakes. "Nascent heart" crystallizes convergence without muddle. Opening/closing resonance elevates closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms disaster tropes through specific mechanics: convergence as "symbolic anchor" using sound vacuum/pressure anomalies. Shipping containers' geometry creates wind patterns central to solution. Emotional specificity in "pulse quickened" avoids generic templates.</comment>
