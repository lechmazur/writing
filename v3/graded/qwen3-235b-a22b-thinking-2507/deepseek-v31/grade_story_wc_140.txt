<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in "seeing what's missing" drives choices; embodied contradiction absent in clerk scene weakens final motivation clarity despite strong micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("keeper of the silence") crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost; clerk confrontation lacks sufficient escalation under Accumulative lens to justify 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (tide-dependent paths); poison label charges final image but body/tool doesn't actively shape tactics beyond discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through pattern recognition (erased histories), but clerk's threat lacks tangible consequence; pressure tightens via protagonist's agency yet cost remains conceptual without physical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through label's reprise as "proof they had been here," avoiding moralizing; "texture of memories" phrasing edges toward abstraction but final image earns resonance through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("seeing hollow spaces") distinct and consistent; dialogue with crane operator shows purposeful compression but clerk exchange lacks subtextual depth in critical confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but "cold certainty" uses label-speak; near-overwriting in container discovery paragraph ("woven into tapestry of absence") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure and physical labyrinth; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through Charged Poise closure, though clerk scene lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
