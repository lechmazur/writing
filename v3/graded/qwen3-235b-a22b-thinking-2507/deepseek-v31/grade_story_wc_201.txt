<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trauma-response bracing versus mercy quest, but "fragile motivation" tell-don't-show slightly undercuts embodied conflict escalation pre-closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with cost ("permanent dissonance"), but Accumulative lens isn't fully taught early—causal strap disengagement risks feeling like a sudden pivot rather than density payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting via proprioception, constraining choices through sensory pressure ("pain-bright shadows"), though binary stars feel ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single tightening (strap disengagement) suffices for length, but internal conflict depth lacks intermediate beats—rage-to-grace shift occurs too rapidly without sufficient prior friction on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through strap's transformation (sensor→catalyst), avoiding moralizing, yet "mathematics of mercy" edges toward abstraction without enough concrete struggle preceding the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ultraviolet shards," "chromatic dance") embodies trauma and enhancement flawlessly; rhythmic control during disengagement ("grunt of effort") modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "symphony of wrongness" slightly strains metaphor but closure ("calculate his first deliberate act of grace") avoids thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of proprioception with mercy mathematics avoids tropes, but ultraviolet penance concept lacks distinctive transformation beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
