<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (impose order vs capture dream) act simultaneously in scene; final endurance of coexistence forecloses capture path with visible cost ("fog no longer felt like an ending"). No diagnostic labels—embodied via breath sync and "marrow of the stones" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation debt: setting/time unclear past 120 words without closure payoff (orchard’s "centuries of fog" remains vague). Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("fog continued to swirl but no longer felt like an ending"), but lens ambiguity penalty caps score despite strong Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog and sextant function as micro-setting constraining choice: acidic soil preserves sextant, crystallized frost enables vision. Final image ("veil between truths") charged by orchard’s transformation, but environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (capture dream vs preserve sanity) deepens via sensory density escalation. Breath synchronization narrows options to endurance, with cost unmistakable in "fog no longer felt like an ending"—a conceptual reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "breathing with the city" as non-literal answer to erasing boundaries. Final image ("tone felt in the marrow") reweights premise without moralizing, embracing complexity: sanity isn’t lost but expanded, avoiding false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("physics of reflection," "geometry of light") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in breath sync sequence ("Breathe in: hum grew louder/Breathe out: boundaries softened"), though "oppressive grey" slightly generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One text artifact in peak pressure: "beautiful and terrifying sound" uses label-heavy abstraction where sensory detail should dominate. Otherwise high density with propulsion; "marrow of the stones" avoids purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes tropes freshly: mirror maker actively synchronizes rather than reflects, sextant measures perception. Emotional specificity in "breathing with the city" avoids generic epiphany; risk-taking (glass mountains as physical sensation) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
