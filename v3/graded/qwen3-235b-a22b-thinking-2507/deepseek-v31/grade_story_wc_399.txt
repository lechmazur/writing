<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; the Line Walker's "simple and pure" drive avoids layered tension despite embodied actions like peripheral focus. Prophet's condescension reveals stakes but dialogue lacks subtextual depth on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: preserving the echo forecloses the prophet's truth with visible cost (fragile clearing sinking), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors within 50 words; kinetic parapet shift creates causal pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (kinetic parapet) constrains the climax choice and charges the final image; "static prickle" and dune mechanics embody pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—calm pavilion hum versus burning sands—without checklist repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation tightens through protagonist agency: prophet's approach forces ritual acceleration, and parapet manipulation narrows options. Cost (ongoing fragility of preserved wisdom) is felt in "sank beneath the sand," but time pressure lacks a live clock to heighten tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "libraries for feelings" crystallizes the conflict without moralizing. Final image reweights "whisperfield calm" as precious yet fragile, but prophet's "truth does not" line borders on thematic echo without sufficient counterweight in scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "peripheral awareness" filtering dune details; rhythm modulates from murmuring calm to ritual urgency. Prophet's dialogue carries subtext ("tidy up miracles"), though "strangely honest" description risks authorial intrusion under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but "kinetic parapet" description ("ancient mechanism of stone and latent energy") veers into overwriting during high pressure. Zero loops or scaffold, though "conjured clearing" repetition slightly dulls immediacy in consecration beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of philosophical conflict through tactile mechanics (parapet shifting dunes); avoids generic allegory. Emotional specificity in "echo of centuries" elevates tropes, but prophet archetype lacks transformative detail beyond condescension.</comment>
