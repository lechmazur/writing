<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mourning its passing even as she lived it," with embodied grief in "heart a drum" and the visceral shadow-of-hands moment. Epiphany avoids therapy-speak but edges toward tidy resolution in final acceptance, lacking deeper struggle with her archivist identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: "she found its length to be exactly enough" crystallizes the conceptual cost of becoming "unread data" with undeniable pressure. Accumulative lens holds throughout fog's transformation, though single-beat escalation lacks complex deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal pillars constrain choice as memory-readers via shadow mechanics, and the solidifying fog directly seals the observatory, charging the final image. "Geometric panes held captured murmurs" exemplifies tactile specificity that shapes Lyra's actions and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpting identity without a future) tightens via the fog's irreversible sealing, with Lyra's self-conjecture as agency-driven resolution. Cost—"her experience about to become unread data"—is viscerally felt in her shadow examination, though quiet escalation risks feeling slight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through shadow mechanics: identity as the act of meaning-making ("the value was not in the record, but in the recorder"). Final shadow image reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding false balance in her grief-to-peace arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "light was a strange commodity" and rhythm shifts during high-pressure beats. Near-flawless control, though "luminous experience" slightly over-ornaments the climax without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "deepening hush" repetition serves accumulative purpose. Final paragraph's cadence shift ("She did not light a lamp...") delivers propulsion with crystalline clarity, though "pearlescent shell" borders on ornate without cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via archivist lens: shadow-reading method and "preemptive nostalgia" feel freshly grounded. Specificity ("summer-quill," crystal pillars) prevents generality, with emotional truth in her identity crisis outweighing surface novelty.</comment>
