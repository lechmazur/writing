<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "rebellious daughter" sharpening tools to defy him now used to follow him; embodied emotion in weeping "not in sadness, but in profound, complicated understanding" avoids therapy-speak while charging closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: journal realization reconfigures stakes with felt cost ("she wept...") under Accumulative lens; early lantern setup pays off in library when "light finally making sense," avoiding orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mica lantern functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (finding token in darkness) and charges closure; "rainwashed library" evolves from cabin's "clover melancholy" to damp-earth scent, mirroring emotional shift without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding father's legacy) tightens via subway clues that foreclose condemnation path; escalation driven by agency (solving scrawls) under Accumulative lens, though "traverse" action lacks sufficient tactical cost to reach 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "stacked the deck for her" reweights gambling motif into earned grace without moralizing; final image reconfigures "lucid contradictions" as generative hope, avoiding thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("equation to solve his," "fractured the flame into shards") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in "descent deeper into the subway’s belly" teaches pattern early, paid off in library's silent air.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "improbably complex light" slightly overwrites but doesn't obscure closure; strategic telling compresses transit ("she went into the sprawling metropolis") while maintaining propulsion toward resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms gambling trope through probability theorist lens: "carefully calculated bets on people" synthesizes math/philanthropy organically; emotional specificity in "secret philanthropist" avoids middle-ground hedging with bold risk.</comment>
