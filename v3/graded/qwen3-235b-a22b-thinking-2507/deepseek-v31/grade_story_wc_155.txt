<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her shift from solo creation to collaboration; embodied frustration ("anatomy of the long-dead tree eluded her") precedes knowledge network solution. Slight abstraction in "pensive mirth" lacks physical anchoring at peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("fog would return, light would fade") under causal lens. Fragment discovery triggers meaningful tightening (abandoning new display for resurrection), with knowledge network access narrowing options decisively. Orientation flawless in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog actively constrains creation ("threatened to swallow each gleam") and charges final image as counterpoint. Mossy ground hides fragment; cobbles ground movement. Micro-setting (dust, fragment) directly shapes tactics and closure. No tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (artistic joy) tightens through single reversal: frustration over tree anatomy forces knowledge network use, altering tactics. Cost is visible in foreclosed solo vision and "fog would return" acknowledgment. Agency drives escalation under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fragment’s "joy captured in clay" evolving into "collaboration across time." Final image reweights loss/renewal without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "quiet, profound happiness" earns resonance through concrete struggle with dust and memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp (artist noticing textures/colors), rhythm modulates with pressure (staccato during frustration). Slight register drift in "photons danced to her command" feels authorial vs. character-plausible. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("weaving charged dust into moisture-heavy air"). "Woolen blanket" metaphor fresh. Minor register slip: "command" feels technical for artist POV during creation beat. Final line crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms light-painting trope through historical collaboration and fog constraints. Emotional specificity in "lost joy before commissions" avoids generic templates. Fresh synthesis in fragment completing the display metaphorically. Risks lyrical closure without gimmickry.</comment>
