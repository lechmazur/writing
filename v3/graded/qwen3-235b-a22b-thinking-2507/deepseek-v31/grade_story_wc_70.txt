<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear of wonder vs duty) drives climax; "I am afraid" admission embodies cost without therapy-speak. Final choice earns endurance via grandfather's legacy, though emotional layering lacks deeper irrationality in crisis moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "He had no power to give the city, but he had given it back its life." Causal lens holds tight—riddle discovery directly enables choice reconfiguration, and conductor location dictates battery access.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower's iron conductor physically constrains the solution ("where the conductor ends"), and the lacquer box's honey smell charges the final image. Micro-setting (grounding plate compartment) directly alters tactics, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten to irrevocable trade-off (city lights vs food) through Arawn's agency—diagnosing hive link, interpreting riddle. Cost is visceral in "no power to give the city," though blackout urgency lacks a live clock intensifying tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "preserving wonder" resolves non-literally via the empty box's honey scent—a resonant answer to the central question. No moralizing; insight emerges from concrete action (choosing bees over lights), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("nectar dusk," diagnostic truth-telling shaping sparse diction) modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in climax ("A low, spreading hum returned") avoids uniformity, though "involuntarily truthful" exposition slightly disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("swept," "unrolled"). Final line "it was enough" delivers closure with crystalline simplicity. Minor register drift in "auxiliary power" lexicon, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "mystery box" trope—emptiness as revelation of wonder's source. Risk-taking in quiet closure (no city lights restored) heightens stakes, though drone beehives feel slightly derivative without deeper world logic.</comment>
