<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in chain symbolism ("weight he carried"/"dead thing") and embodied sacrifice, but sentry confrontation lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy; final self-imprisonment needs one prior gesture to feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with visceral cost (kneeling on cold floor), but sentry's arrival relies on coincidence rather than causal pressure; "Wall coming down" external clock lacks integration with vault mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting constrains action (piano bench puzzle) and charges final image (arrow gleaming), but "dust motes thick as felt" overwrites early pressure; environment doesn't actively alter tactics beyond initial discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when sentry appears, forcing the vault-sealing choice, but external conflict resolution feels coincidental (kick misdirects shot); dominant "protect seeds" stake lacks internal tension with "chained liberator" identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" motif reweights meaning beautifully in final forest image, avoiding moralizing, but "plant resilience in dry soil" motivation remains abstract; theme emerges cleanly through dissonant chord and sealed vault symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile details ("calloused finger," "velvet bench") modulates under stress; single POV stays coherent through high-pressure beats with rhythmic control in vault-sealing sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until sentry confrontation where "snapping across the floor" and "deafening shriek" create simultaneity error; minor paraphrase loop in "staggering grace" descriptions dulls peak-beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of liberation myth with ecological hope through specific "iridescent arrow" cipher; risks unconventional closure (protagonist trapped) but "carnival prize redemption" setting lacks transformative specificity to avoid trope echoes.</comment>
