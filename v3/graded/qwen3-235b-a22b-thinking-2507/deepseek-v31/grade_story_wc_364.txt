<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elara clutches silk during disorientation—embodied fear vs resolve—but "simmering thing" risks abstraction; micro-choices like the barter ritual earn her transformation, though contradictory impulses could deepen under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the silo’s "azure defiance" crystallizes earned resilience with cost legible in "memories drawn like water through a sieve"; Accumulative lens holds via disorientation-to-clarity density shift, though mine descent’s vagueness slightly blurs spatial causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s floating arches and glowing moss constrain choices (mine disorientation, silo design), but Cyan-Thistle’s luminous fruit feels ornamental; the silk’s tactile anchor charges the climax, though azure sky’s "taunt" risks over-signaling early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via disorientation’s psychic assault narrowing options to "clutch silk or collapse," with memory trade as felt cost; escalation lacks one visible price paid mid-journey (e.g., lost tool), muting tactical consequences before the barter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Asterium’s duality (fragile ore/hard metal), avoiding moralizing; the final silo’s "intelligent perseverance" reweights rubble as resilience without stating morals, though "fragility could forge strength" leans toward tell in setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV voice distills Elara’s quiet precision ("determination a silent, simmering thing"), with rhythmic control during disorientation; slight register drift in "bartered her old self" risks abstraction, but perceptual bias (forge solace vs market bustle) stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters with "confused spirits" cliché and "simmering thing" abstraction; "water through a sieve" metaphor shines, but scaffold phrasing ("deliberate, each step considered") dulls propulsion in critical descent beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "meek blacksmith as quiet revolutionary" avoids trope; Asterium’s barter ritual transforms "resilience" from theme to causal engine, though orchard planet leans familiar without deeper ecological stakes.</comment>
