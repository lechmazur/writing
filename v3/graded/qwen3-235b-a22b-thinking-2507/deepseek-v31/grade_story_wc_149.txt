<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to repay the debt is concrete and embodied through her tactile interactions with the orchard and bead, but internal contradiction is muted—her resolve lacks meaningful struggle against competing impulses, weakening the 9+ gate despite strong sensory interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the ghost's dissolution into starlight and new shoot growth reconfigure the debt's meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (centuries of sorrow transformed into hope), validated under the Accumulative/Textural lens through escalating emotional density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (Elara must find the bead to resolve the dying grove), charging the final image with the silver shoot—though "peaches that smelled of tears" edges toward ornamental symbolism without sufficient tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens shines as the ghost's ephemeral appearances deepen emotional stakes, culminating in the devastating realization that the debt is for a "life unlived"; the cost—ghost's dissolution—is felt through the orchard's rebirth and Elara's tear, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-sustenance transforms organically through the orchard's mechanics and the bead's revelation; the final shoot offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "debt" without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete stakes ("sustenance of decay" becoming "sweetness and hope").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature anchors Elara's POV ("hands pale as moonstone," scent of petrichor), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure ("a silent chime reverberated"); minimal dialogue carries subtext via "lovingly venomous" impressions, though compression risks slight abstraction in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density and propulsion, but "wave of pure, golden light exploded" overwrites the climax with stacked modifiers that dilute immediacy; no loops or scaffold, yet figurative muddle in this peak beat prevents 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenuity in transforming "resonant awakening" from metaphor to literal orchard mechanic creates fresh emotional stakes; the debt-for-"life unlived" twist feels inevitable through prior particulars, though winter timeframe's vagueness slightly blunts risk distinction.</comment>
