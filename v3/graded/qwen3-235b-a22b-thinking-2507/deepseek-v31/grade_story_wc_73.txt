<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grim optimist") manifests in her meticulous risk-taking with the dice; embodied emotion in the dice-rattling ritual and skid maneuver. Final choice to redirect motion, not break it, earns endurance with visible cost (fresh fracture). Avoids therapy-speak despite high-stakes crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change: gravitational inversion via dice impact creates irreversible escape with conceptual cost (fractured die). Causal lens holds—chip’s asymmetry enables the torque calculation. Persistent constraint (staircase’s reset) shapes her tactics; cost legible in "fresh, minute fracture" upon landing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the chipped die (tool) constrains her entire strategy and charges the final image. Sensory details (scuffing boots, twisting geometry, cool moss) filter through mathematician’s urgency. Staircase’s reset mechanic actively pressures her chalk experiments, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her agency: reframing "redirecting motion" over "breaking it" narrows options to one lethal maneuver. Cost is visceral—skidding impact risks annihilation, paid via the die’s fracture. Coincidence (die landing on edge) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her calculation drives the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "boundless confinement" reweights into "boundless potential" via the die’s fracture. Final image rejects tidy moralizing—she trades "hollow ache" for "profound uncertainty," avoiding thematic echo. Epiphany is earned through mathematical struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: math metaphors ("theorem of boundless confinement") align with her profession without jargon. Rhythm accelerates during the run ("counting steps under her breath") then crystallizes post-landing. Zero POV drift; lyrical compression ("sound was of twisting geometry") taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("a grim optimist, a woman who saw the elegant misery of her prison"). "Twisting geometry" avoids mixed metaphor. Final line’s cadence ("chose a direction to walk") resolves momentum without overwriting. Minor cadence dip in "epochs" reflection, but within BRR allowance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes mathematical purgatory trope with fresh emotional specificity: "capturing the texture of a missed opportunity" transforms abstract regret into tactile fracture. Risk-taking (lateral thrust via dice impact) heightens stakes coherently. No derivative echoes; "perpetual motion" reconfigured as manipulable energy feels inevitable.</comment>
