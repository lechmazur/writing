<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's blindness as active constraint drives micro-choices (submerging drone in water), but lacks visible flaw compounding pressure; "relentless, patient grace" slightly over-smooths struggle under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: ship's horn confirms voyage success while Elara's solitude implies exhaustion from her "final task," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fountain water functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (only method to read fractures) and charges closure through drone's flight path mirroring her tactile navigation, avoiding ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor clang escalates stakes via Accumulative/Textural lens by tightening time pressure; cost legible in "relentless, patient grace" labor that forecloses alternative repair methods under deadline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final drone flight reweights "interpretation over observation" theme through concrete action (charting course through interference), avoiding moralizing while resonating with Elara's sensory adaptation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hollow drip," "warmth from its core") maintains blind POV integrity; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical focus to staccato tension during harbor clang without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystalline dart against grey sky" propels closure with precise texture, though "relentless, patient grace" slightly abstracts labor cost before being grounded by "whisper-soft touch."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms repair trope through sensory inversion (blindness enabling superior navigation); "teach it to read the world as she did" synthesizes tech/emotion with risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
