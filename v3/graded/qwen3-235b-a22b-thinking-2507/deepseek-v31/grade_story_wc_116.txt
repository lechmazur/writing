<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (observation vs. preservation) drives the pivotal choice, but "placid lake" cliché slightly abstracts embodied emotion during crisis. Micro-choice of unfolding the swan reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: exhaustion and "fragile thing" acknowledgment crystallize cost under Accumulative lens. Escalation through sensory degradation (hum intensifying) reweights stakes, though fracture's urgency could deepen earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Origami swan functions as essential micro-setting object—constrains choice via cryptic fold and charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (decay, silence pressure) mirrors internal state without overt symbolism; volcanic glass reflects mended calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (silence as regenerative force) tighten texturally through hum's progression, but the "crumbling peace" concept isn't viscerally tested until climax. Cost (exhaustion, fragility) legible, though dominant pressure could escalate sooner under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final swan-folding image reweights "witnessing" as active preservation without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars (light fracture, origami mechanics), avoiding abstraction. "Map is not territory" line avoids thematic echo via character-specific voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing decay, silence as texture) modulates rhythm under pressure—"tangled and harsh" diction compresses thought during crisis. Minor "placid lake" cliché prevents 9.2 despite otherwise controlled voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roots cracked through ancient stone" shows textural specificity. "Placid lake" cliché in low-pressure moment dulls immediacy slightly, but no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line’s cadence resolves with recharged motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "keeper of knowledge" trope via volcanic glass refuge and origami as geomantic tool. Emotional specificity in choosing preservation over pure observation avoids abstraction; swan’s evolution feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
