<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation ("step beyond fate's design") and embodied emotion ("cold fire in his veins"), but final endurance lacks earned micro-choices during reversal; "bleak exhilaration" repetition dilutes contradictory impulses at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly with device activation triggering time reversal, but cost isn't *felt* on-page—conceptual consequence (barren seabed) lacks visceral embodiment like gasping for thinning air during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (hunger stone's "subtractive light") constrains choices and charges closure; lighthouse's tidal urgency and un-weathering walls directly alter tactics, with final seabed image reweighting the entire premise through concrete environmental collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from tidal race to world unraveling, but oxygen thinning remains observational—no visible physiological cost (e.g., choking) to charge the final image under causal lens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "latent radiance" reweights from hope to desolation in the final barren seabed image, avoiding moralizing while resonating with the hunger stone's weeping warning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("oil and grit" fingers, "cold fire" energy) with rhythmic control during device activation, but verbatim "bleak exhilaration" repetition creates syntactic monotony in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean propulsion overall, but paraphrase loop in closure beat ("air grew thin and stale, the oxygen unraveling") dulls the catastrophe's immediacy; disallowed 9+ due to artifact in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms hunger stone from drought relic to causality-reversal tool; specific yoyo mechanics ("primer of a universe wound backwards") feels inevitable, with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
