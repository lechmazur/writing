<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fix’s "steadily curious" trait drives the kaleidoscope improvisation under pressure, with embodied emotion in "slumped in irreverent awe" avoiding diagnostic labels. Minor flaw depth—arrow-tip miscalculation lacks compound struggle—but final choice to input "purity" is earned through prior causality and visible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: Fix’s input of "purity" causes the sea’s softening and "resonance felt in the soul," with causal escalation via the kaleidoscope’s necessity. Orientation flawless (acid sea/workshop anchored in 30 words); no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope (micro-setting) constrains the climax—its prism/mirrors enable pattern translation—and charges the final image with "steadily and curiously, to listen." Sensory specificity excels ("virulent green," "sweet scent"), though tactile workshop details thin during the resolution beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when static forces Fix’s "desperate whim" with the kaleidoscope, narrowing options to improvisation. Agency drives escalation (curiosity → transliteration), and conceptual cost is legible via the "soul-resonance," though personal stakes could deepen the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: light patterns "transliterated" into biological/geological fractals avoid moralizing. Final image (softening sea) answers "what is purity?" non-literally, reweighting the "bell" metaphor with undeniable conceptual cost—no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Fix notices "optical harmonics," not scenery. Voice modulates perfectly from technical ("transliterate") to lyrical ("visual symphony of change"), with rhythmic control in the climax. Minor register drift in "mathematical undercurrent" saved by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via dense verbs ("skimmed," "soften"). Near-miss: "mathematical undercurrent" slightly abstract but rescued by "itch of existence." Final line’s "began, steadily and curiously, to listen" ties motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "yearning algorithm" avoids cliché via light-pattern transliteration. Risk-taking (abstract climax) heightens stakes coherently—kaleidoscope solution transforms the "bell" quest. Emotional specificity in Fix’s irreverent awe elevates beyond trope.</comment>
