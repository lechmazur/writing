<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between desire to integrate memories and fear of madness is embodied in "quaking reverie" and "threatened to unravel her resolve," but "helix-minded" trait remains label-only without constraining choices. Micro-choice to lean into eyepiece earns the epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "cheeks wet with another man’s tears" and "threatened to unravel her own resolve" crystallize stakes. Accumulative lens holds through splintered visions reweighting her purpose as restorer rather than archaeologist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon’s "liquid" silver light actively pools below her perch, and the broken mirror’s crack physically shapes fragmented visions. Final image of her working "in the silent canyon" charges the micro-setting as constraint and legacy anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integration vs. madness) tightens through intensifying visions from joy to murdered dream, with visceral cost in tears and shaking. Pressure grows via protagonist’s agency initiating the test, though vision reception feels slightly passive during escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "his failure was now her foundation" reweights the crack as necessary. Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing—"heir to a legacy" crystallizes transformed purpose through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via engineer-poet duality ("graphite and oil" hands, "frozen turbulence"). Stress compresses syntax to visceral fragments ("A jolt... Then came the flood"), though "synaptic plasticity" momentarily breaks POV lexicon with clinical abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "webbed with a crack like a captured lightning bolt" demonstrates textural specificity. Rhythm varies from lyrical ("gash of silver and shadow") to staccato under pressure ("A jolt, like static electricity, shot through her teeth").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "broken object" trope by making fracture integral to legacy. Emotional specificity (baking bread scent, paper boat joy) avoids cliché, while "murdered" dream adds non-obvious moral weight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
