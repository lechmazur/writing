<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines via marginalia ("One what?") but climax lacks contradictory impulses; motivation remains abstract despite strong embodied moments like dictionary fragility. No second character to test relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("beautiful complex process of truth"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—cosmic hiccup triggers predetermined action without tactical tradeoffs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library isn't backdrop but active constraint: stone shelves dictate spiral pattern, dictionary's fragility charges climax. Micro-setting (dictionary as blank-page vessel) directly shapes closure's final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("unravel illusions") clear early, but conflict remains abstract; hiccup forces crystalline arrangement without visible cost or tactical sacrifice. Density increase suffices for Accumulative lens but cost lacks visceral legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "unify" margin note evolving into merged luminescence; final image answers "One what?" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity via spiral arbitration's layered understanding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("resounding hush as physical presence") and rhythmic control elevate prose, but peak stress lacks compression—hiccup reaction ("He understood. This was it.") feels too clinically precise for cosmic unraveling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Holding them all in consciousness" violates established constraints as therapy-speak; "mind expanding" in climax triggers Patterned-artifact penalty (-0.7). Otherwise, zero loops with strategic density ("cosmic hiccup" compresses spacetime elegantly).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Borgesian library with cosmology; "spiral arbitration" transforms trope through concrete mechanics (crystal arrangement). Risks quiet climax but "universe's hiccup" edges toward quirkiness without sufficient grounding.</comment>
