<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cautious abandon") manifests in fox trade choice with visible emotional cost. Slight over-explanation of "chivalrous code" early on edges toward label-speak but redeemed by earned sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with unmistakable cost: "he had not just taken; he had given" crystallizes the earned trade-off. Causal chain (swap→trade→fix) holds perfectly under Causal lens with no soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains tactics (numb fingers, crystalline window entry) and chessboards charge the closure as micro-setting. Final sky transformation reweights the opening "bruised plum" with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten coherently under Causal lens: keeper's lid demand forces the fox trade, narrowing options to a visible emotional cost. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice but keeper's playful tone slightly softens the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("amending through understanding") not statement. Final sky image reweights the opening bruise without moralizing, though "true apprentice of wonder" edges toward slight tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct thief-POV texture ("fingers numb," "hollow core waiting") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift in "Artificer of Whims" slightly jars but doesn't fracture voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("breath hung like a ghost" establishes cold/action). Figurative language precise except "heart thundered" cliché in high-pressure beat. Closure imagery razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms thief trope via specific logic: chivalry as trade (not non-stealing). Fox sacrifice carries emotional truth, but spire setting leans slightly familiar despite strong integration.</comment>
