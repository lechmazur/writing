<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "empirically ironic" weight and surrender moment; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak. Slight abstraction in "profound wealth" final state slightly dilutes closure cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "frugality replaced by wealth" crystallizes stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through failed sequences to palm-on-tile micro-turn. Zero orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tile's coolness, warm stone) constrains her surrender choice and charges final "dusky harmony" image. Schematics evolve from static to dissolving energy, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through three failed sequences under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to surrender. Cost is legible in "frugality replaced" with visible identity shift. Agency drives escalation purely through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "truths felt not solved" earned through square's transformation from puzzle to "map of mind at peace." Zero moralizing; final image reweights "dusky harmony" with profound resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is astronomer-specific: notices "orbital paths," "precession." Voice modulates from clinical ("parsing patterns") to lyrical surrender without register drift. Zero filter verbs or scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; "empirically ironic" is precise not label-speak. Final line recharges "dusky harmony" with crystalline density. Slight abstraction in "profound wealth" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "astronomer meets magic" trope through specific logic-devotion conflict. Fresh inflection: square as balance map, not puzzle. Emotional truth in academic surrender avoids gimmickry.</comment>
