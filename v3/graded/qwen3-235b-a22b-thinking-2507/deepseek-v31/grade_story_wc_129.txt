<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kaelin's shift from frustration to kinship through the tag search; "luminescent ache" embodies motivation without therapy-speak. Final grafting act earns endurance with visible cost in the transformed orchard light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the reed sculpture in the final tag reweights the arbor's meaning with undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds through pattern discovery; cost legible in "silence of profound understanding" crystallizing community.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian arbor and marsh-reeds constrain every choice—Kaelin's craft enables the ending sculpture, while the orchard's light charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects sculptor's bias: "calloused fingers" and "phosphorescent silver" drive action over exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs community) tightens through the tag pattern's discovery, narrowing options to collective action. Agency shines in Kaelin proposing the search; cost manifests as the orchard's "silence of profound understanding" reconfiguring history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tags-as-remembering motif, never stated: the final reed sculpture in the arbor offers non-literal resolution to "grafting onto community." Avoids moralizing by showing shared purpose through action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—Kaelin notices textures ("calloused," "glimmering") and craft details under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in the climax ("a silence fell, deeper than the absence of sound"), though minor abstraction ("quiet, desperate need") slightly dulls interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with lines like "a plea or perhaps a history" doing triple duty. "Luminescent ache" evolves without muddle, though "whispers against permanent, singing stone" risks slight abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "vandalism" trope through historian-artist reveal; specificity of marsh-reeds and crystalline twigs prevents genericness. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—the pattern discovery feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
