<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s "diligently curious" trait drives tangible micro-choices (ignoring crew, tracing patterns) with embodied cost (sociable isolation as necessary price). Contradictory impulses—solitude vs. discovery craving—crystallize in her silent awe, avoiding epiphany clichés. Final cartographer identity shift earns via prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through decoding density until Charged Poise closure. "Sociable isolation had been the necessary price" legibly charges cost. Orientation clear by line 15 ("antique airship, *The Oriole*"), closure reweights sky’s meaning via celestial phenomenon’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hopscotch board (micro-setting) constrains discovery method and charges final image—dusty game vs. "new cosmos." Sensory details filtered through cartographer’s bias (ignoring starlings for etched planks). Antique airship’s luminance-storing wood directly enables closure, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("chart next great discovery") tightens through cipher-decoding, narrowing options to the void. Agency entirely Elara’s—no coincidence—culminating in felt cost of isolation crystallized during revelation. Single deepening suffices; stakes viscerally felt via racing thoughts syncing with starlings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: hopscotch’s "hidden logic" mirrors isolation enabling discovery. Final image ("solitary figure charting new cosmos from dusty game") reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (not shouting triumph) and phrasebook’s dog-ear = dedication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartographer notices etched planks over starlings. Voice modulates with tension—lyrical descriptions tighten during decoding ("Her finger traced..."). Zero head-hopping; lexicon fits ("navigational bearing"). Rhythmic control peaks in final line’s crystallizing metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every phrase advances atmosphere/character ("dusty, ignored... but to her, whispered hidden logic"). Metaphors coherent ("starling murmurations flowed like living rivers"). Closure beat ("dusty game" vs. "new cosmos") achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial discovery via hopscotch cipher transforms exploration tropes. Emotional truth in quiet awe ("did not shout") over triumph. Specific details (dog-eared phrasebook, starling-synced thoughts) avoid genericity. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
