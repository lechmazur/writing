<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (longing vs defiance) but lacks embodied stress degradation; conductor’s flat dialogue misses status dynamics despite dual presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with clock’s micro-movement as conceptual cost, but lens ambiguity at midpoint (Accumulative vs Causal) risks coherence without explicit signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal Arbor’s light-platforms and compasses constrain choices; final clock-twitch charges closure via recurring object, though "golden hour" verges on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through compass distortion → film code → piano solution, but conductor’s "strategically creative" trait lacks visible tradeoffs to deepen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clock/film/piano interplay; "surprise fate" reweights via unplanned encore without moralizing, though wistfulness risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghostly goodbyes," "percussive knock") modulates under pressure, but conductor’s voice lacks idiom differentiation in sparse dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, yet "steely longing" cliché and conductor’s corporate diction ("strategically creative") create minor register drift in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film static as musical code elevates tropes, but celestial terminal setup feels derivative despite specific lyrical execution.</comment>
