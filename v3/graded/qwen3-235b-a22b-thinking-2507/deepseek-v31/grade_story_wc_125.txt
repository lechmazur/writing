<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via rope’s "pattern of desperation and freedom"; embodied choice (laying circle not binding) earns renunciation with visible cost ("forever deny himself"). No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: rope-circle act forecloses enlightenment path with conceptual cost ("texture of time... space between one breath"). Accumulative lens holds—textural buildup (pulsing walls, ozone air) tightens to crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto constrains choice: its "pulsed light" creates urgency for sealing, while rope-circle on floor charges final image. Micro-setting (clay/ozone air) embodies thematic pressure without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chaos vs. protection) deepens via protagonist’s agency: his prison-escape parallel transforms abstract choice into embodied trade-off. Cost unmistakable in "forever deny himself," reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope/grotto particulars: "architecture of choices" crystallizes non-literal answer to "texture of time." Final image ("space between one breath") avoids moralizing while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasting ozone," rope’s "kinks and weaves") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("He saw the pattern clearly..."); no head-hopping despite abstract entities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("frayed and broken halo" does triple duty). Figurative language sparse but potent ("planet’s veins plugged into strange new heart"). Final line avoids muddle with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic beings pose philosophical choice through tactile rope metaphor. Transformation test passed—swapping "rope" for chain breaks escape symbolism. Risk-taking (textural escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
