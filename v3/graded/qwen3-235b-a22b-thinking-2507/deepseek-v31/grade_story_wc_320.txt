<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in discarding loud-birth assumptions; embodied emotion via hair-raising electricity and fragment glow. Final renunciation of failure (hands falling from controls) earns visible cost through years of struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via "peeling back layers" to coalescing dust. Charged Poise closure lands with cost—fragment dimming signifies expended effort—reconfiguring gorge from tomb to lighthouse under lunar light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned city constrains choice (only lunar perigee works); gorge setting charges final image as "lighthouse for new dawn." Tool (Hollywood fragment) directly enables the hush discovery, glowing then dimming with tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: discarding assumptions drives the micro-adjustments. Visible cost—years of failure resolved by paradigm shift—charges the final image as dust coalesces into "reverse explosion" under silent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "silent 'again'" reweights stellar death as cradle without moralizing. Final image (gorge as lighthouse) offers non-literal answer to "beginning in every ending," avoiding abstraction through dust coalescence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fantasy practicality" calibrates magic via cracked dials. Rhythmic control peaks in tuning sequence ("peeling back layers of universe"), with elision (no second character) taught early and paid off in solitary triumph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density slip: "reverse explosion" metaphor slightly contradicts "gentle gathering" physics. Otherwise, zero loops; propulsion via strong verbs ("groaned," "churn," "coalescing") and strategic telling compresses transit to lunar perigee necessity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence as catalyst transforms cosmic birth tropes. Emotional specificity in Elara’s "calm" reaction avoids generic awe; "serenely electric" hush redefines creation myth through scientific reverence without gimmickry.</comment>
