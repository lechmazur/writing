<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes organically from duty to answering the plea; embodied emotion in "faint, sad echo of childhood laughter" avoids label-speak. Final renunciation (allowing rest) is earned with visible cost in the stars' appearance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "first true stars began to appear" legibly reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost. Hybrid lens (accumulative to causal) holds; orientation anchors within 100 words. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Clockwork Heart constrains choices (nested patterns calibration) and charges final image; "pane of hush" evolves from barrier to blanket. Micro-setting specificity ("carved oak puppet head") shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (maintain clock vs. permit rest) tighten through Elara's agency when she reads the puppet's fracture lines. Escalation via deepening knowledge ("shared token") narrows options, with cost legible in the stars' emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (puppet head, lullaby), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "it was all right to rest" as resonant CR without stated moral; complexity lingers in "whatever form it might take."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised-purple light," "stone throat silent") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in "falling through layers of silence" teaches pattern; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("cracked masterpiece" compresses theme/action). One borderline stock phrase ("bruised awe") avoided overwriting in peak beats. Final line recharges motifs with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Doomsday Clock trope through "beautifully flawed" specificity. Emotional truth in "loved the world enough to let it go" avoids abstraction; risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
