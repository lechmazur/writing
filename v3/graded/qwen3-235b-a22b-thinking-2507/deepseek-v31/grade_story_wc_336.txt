<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in climax; motivation is pure preservation without darker complexity. Strengths: embodied emotion ("breath catching") and micro-choices (clutching seed pouch) anchor interiority. Final choice lacks nuanced trade-off beyond self-sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: seed hums while grayness persists, cost legible in "Elara weakened, her breath catching." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation. Orientation clear by line 3 with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant parapet functions as indispensable micro-setting: mist enables essence gathering, constrains tactics, and charges final image ("world beyond the mist shone"). Waterfall's "great white sound" mirrors the ritual's cleansing purpose without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally: fading colors push back as "weary nihilism" during essence gathering. Agency clear in pouring hope when weakening. Cost (physical drain, temporary victory) is visible and shapes the Earned Stasis closure. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "color of wonder" as gathered essence, not abstraction. Final image ("world shone with original brilliance") answers central question without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality with "gray pall did not vanish," embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: colors as sensations ("green as cool life"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("swirling, silent storm") taught early. Compression ("years... settling over the land") pays off in closure. Zero head-hopping; POV stable through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion. "Roar of water was not a noise... but a silence" shows via texture. Peak beats avoid therapy-speak ("breath catching" not "I'm exhausted"). Final line recharges "verdant parapet" motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "weaving between worlds" as sensory ritual, not fantasy trope. Emotional specificity in "children who never saw red apples" grounds universality. Avoids abstraction; transformation test passes—changing names would break the pruning-to-essence logic.</comment>
