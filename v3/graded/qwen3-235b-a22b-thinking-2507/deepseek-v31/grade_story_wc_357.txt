<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("quiet obsession") drives every action, but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; the arrow tip discovery triggers embodied change ("moss erupted") yet internal conflict remains unlayered at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly with cost ("she was changed"), but "fragile, everlasting dance" borders on thematic echo; Accumulative lens holds through density shift in geode chamber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Geode setting charges final image ("keeper of the silence") and constrains choice via upward water navigation; crystalline echoes transform "whirling silence" from atmosphere to embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Gravity inversion creates stakes, but escalation relies on coincidence (arrow tip discovery); protagonist's passive observation undermines agency-driven tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silence" motif reweighted from atmospheric detail to existential duty; avoids moralizing but secondary "resilience" concept lacks sufficient friction with primary stake.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in hydrological focus ("navigating by water flow"), but "whirling silence" repetition dulls rhythmic control; psychic distance modulates flawlessly during geode revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft nearly flawless, but "whirling silence" template cadence in final paragraph triggers -0.5 artifact penalty; no loops elsewhere, yet closure beat suffers rhythmic stagnation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time-memory battery transcends sci-fi tropes; "silicate-grass planet" specificity grounds universals, though gravity inversion mechanism feels underdeveloped for the risk taken.</comment>
