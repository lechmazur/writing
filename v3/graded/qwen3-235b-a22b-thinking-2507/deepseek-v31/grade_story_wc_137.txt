<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction (skeptic craving wonder) drives every choice; embodied emotions like "taste of Arctic krill" avoid therapy-speak. Final belief earned through visceral whale memories, though "terrifying and wonderful clarity" slightly tells where showing would deepen cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: his skepticism shattered by "visceral truth" of whale memories. Accumulative lens holds—memory density deepens until broadcast crystallizes options. Cost legible in "he believed," reconfiguring his entire worldview without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tower functions as micro-setting: retractable dome enables whale-song reception, stone floor vibrations ground sensory hierarchy. Tile’s evolution from paperweight to translator charges closure, but tower’s constraints could pressure choices more actively during broadcast setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency: nightly tile use deepens emotional stakes until broadcast forces crystallization. Cost (shattered skepticism) is felt in "visceral truth overwhelmed doubt," though whale song’s subtle "deepening" slightly mutes consequence. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: "unheard symphony" metaphor reweights chaos/resonance without moralizing. Final broadcast offers resonant answer—"he believed"—proving structured resonance via charged image, avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clinical "sympathetic skeptic" voice modulates into lyrical whale memories ("exhilarating strain of a long journey"). Rhythmic control under pressure flawless, though "profound, thrumming music" slightly tells where showing would heighten immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "numbers swirled like ink in water" shows without telling. High density ("entangled memories, somehow stored") propels momentum. Minor overwriting risk in "exhilarating strain" offset by immediate sensory redemption ("taste of Arctic krill").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms whale-communication trope via magic square mechanics: "entangled memories" reframe emotional transcription as scientific rigor. Fresh angle (sculpting space for reflection via broadcast) avoids derivative safety, with specificity anchoring universals in stargazer’s tower.</comment>
