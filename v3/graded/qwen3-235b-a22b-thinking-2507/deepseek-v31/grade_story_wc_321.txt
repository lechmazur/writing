<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Felix's "resiliently positive" core manifests through concrete micro-choices under duress (rushing to hourglass, focusing on memories) rather than labels; contradictory impulses—duty versus metaphysical crisis—drive the climax with visceral cost in "haunting knowledge that all moments are simultaneous and fragile."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: restored normalcy ("city's skyline glittering") reweights time's fragility with conceptual cost ("permanent transient tone"), but Felix's transition from chaos to control lacks one tightening beat—the "sudden instinctual clarity" about timelines feels slightly unearned before the radio call.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hourglass functions as micro-setting: its emptiness constrains Felix's tactic (using it to anchor time) and charges the final image ("dusty relic"), while salt-tinged air and radio handset's cold plastic filter through his deckhand priorities, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (unwritten commuters) escalate through Felix's agency—radio call as a meaningful tightening—but the "sudden instinctual clarity" about timelines lacks friction; cost crystallizes in "haunting knowledge," yet the peak choice feels slightly compressed without a visible trade-off in the grotto.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars: "journey permanent, passengers transient" reweights time's fragility without moralizing; the final image ("silent keeper of the threshold") offers resonant, non-literal answer to simultaneity, avoiding sentimentality through Felix's solitary burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: deckhand noticing "salt-tinged air" and "surly passengers," with syntax tightening under stress ("Steady on!"); rhythmic control in "thunderous click" and "fleeting constant" modulates pressure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts: "grey river of suits" avoids cliché, but "flickered like a bad transmission, their outlines blurring" risks paraphrase loop; final line ("silent keeper of the threshold") recharges motif with textural precision, though one density dip in grotto description slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through ferryman specificity: "spectral grotto" shimmering with "captured starlight" and memory anchors (child's laughter at bow) create fresh emotional truth; risk-taking (radio as timeline beacon) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
