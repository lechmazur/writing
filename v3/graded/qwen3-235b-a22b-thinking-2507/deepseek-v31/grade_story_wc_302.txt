<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak during fear declaration; "I am afraid" lacks simultaneous suppression impulse. Motivation rooted in fragmented visions earns high band, but micro-choices lack layered irrationality at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost in veil-lifting, but propagation delay mechanics feel under-integrated in final beat. Accumulative lens holds, though one causal gap prevents 9.0+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Confidence man's watch constrains every choice and charges the final image ("still and cold"). Mist-shrouded coast and library light create purposeful micro-setting that physically shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by documentation deepening under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in transformed silence. Father's letter revelation slightly convenient, but cyclic cipher groundwork earns the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image reweights "unspoken words" theme without moralizing; "two letters as mirrors" crystallizes complexity. Avoids thematic echo while making conceptual cost undeniable through Elara's self-guardianship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispers of waking world," "crystallized resonance") persists under pressure. Minor register drift in "propagation delays" phrase disrupts voice coherence at critical moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is label-only feeling; "silence did not feel like absence but presence" borders on therapy-speak. Two prose artifacts prevent 8.8+ despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-self through cyclic ciphers feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "propagation delays" lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
