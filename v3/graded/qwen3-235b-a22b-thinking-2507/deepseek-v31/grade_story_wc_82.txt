<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in visceral grief-transformation; embodied emotion in glass-folding as micro-choices under pressure. Slight vagueness in shadow's nature risks motivation clarity, but interior contradiction (weight vs. lightness) powers closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("piece of your soul" exchanged for shaped grief), lens held as Accumulative/Textural. Orientation clear by 50 words; cost legible in "grief was no longer a weight inside him but a thing he held."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic glass and dream-gem constrain every choice; final lantern glow charges closure. Micro-setting (polishing cloth, root-like paths) shapes tactics and reweights regret into blue aureole. No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing shadow's essence) tightens via soul-cost escalation. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens but Keeper scene lacks meaningful opposition; cost visible in lightness/loss trade-off during descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light-grief metamorphosis; final crane glow offers resonant answer without moralizing. "Luminous peace" reweights "luminous torment" with conceptual cost of soul-fragment loss, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (craftsman's tactile focus); rhythmic control in folding sequence. Minor register drift in "shattering sorrow gilded by beauty" risks overwriting but paid off in closure's simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "each crease was a goodbye" compression. Slight figurative muddle in "void so profound it felt louder than any noise" but no closure impact. Strategic telling compresses ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief origami via light; emotional specificity avoids trope. Risk-taking (dream-gem as memory medium) heightens stakes coherently. Shadow detachment premise transformed through volcanic glass craft.</comment>
