<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak stress; micro-choices (needle persuasion vs cutting) reveal values but internal conflict remains singularly focused on the task without competing desires undermining her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("weight in Elara’s chest lifted"); Accumulative lens holds as silence density breaks into "warm, forgiving wave" reconfiguring the dominant stake of unrest through sensory reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary’s fractured starlight actively charges the final image ("colors purer"), while the tapestry needle constrains every action—its evolution to "instrument of absolution" directly shapes closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara’s agency: silence accumulation tightens pressure until the final knot’s release, with visceral cost legible in the lifted chest weight and mask’s shift from "rictus of fear" to "weary acceptance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete unraveling ("confession in reverse"), avoiding moralizing; the final "light with the quiet of a story told" offers non-literal resolution to guilt’s burden without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in salt-taste synesthesia and rope-whisper textures, though "interlaced hush" description edges toward abstraction; rhythmic control under pressure remains precise without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "profound quiet" slightly abstracts the sensory moment; no loops or scaffold detected, though "woven tapestry of withheld breaths" risks minor overwriting in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms guilt trope through specific net-unraveling mechanics and salt-blistered clay; prism light’s purification feels inevitable yet fresh, though risk-taking stays within lyrical tradition without radical structural innovation.</comment>
