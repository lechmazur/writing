<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: uncertainty vs desperate creation; embodied emotion via breath-holding and trembling hands. Final choice to incorporate the charm—not hide the break—earns renunciation of perfectionism with visible cost in released breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: statue’s head-turn reconfigures "testament" against oblivion with felt cost in Elara’s exhaled breath. Causal lens holds—charm discovery drives repair shift—no orientation debt; cost proof clear at "breath she hadn’t realized she was still holding."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tarnished cog charm) constrains choice and charges final image: its mechanical fit redefines repair. Acid sea’s corrosion pressures tactics early; "cartography of damage" filters perception through Elara’s craft bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conjure meaning vs oblivion) tightens when heart crack defies patterns, forcing Elara’s agency to reinterpret the charm. Cost is visceral—lifelong uncertainty resolved through embracing cause-as-cure—legible in her exhalation and the statue’s liquid-gold gaze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi practice becoming philosophy: "broken now whole in a way pristine never could be" reweights damage as strength without moralizing. Final image—a mended hand raised in testament—offers resonant answer to meaning-making amid decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "pockmarks as stellar coordinate" reveals Elara’s craft-trained eye. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Frustrated, Elara slumped"). Slight register drift in "coherent history that would accept the binding" avoids committee voice but nudges academic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stellar coordinate" metaphor pays off when revealed as mechanical. Gold’s "luminous river stitching time" avoids purple prose by serving character logic. Final line’s "humming, enchanted air" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms kintsugi from craft trope into cosmic repair: charm as catalyst (not tool) feels inevitable. Specificity anchors universals—tarnished cog, acid sea—avoiding safety-middle. Risk-taking (statue animation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, charging final image.</comment>
