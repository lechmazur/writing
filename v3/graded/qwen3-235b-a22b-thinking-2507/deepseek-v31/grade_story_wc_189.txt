<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Ayla’s frustration vs. curiosity, embodied through tactile details like "calloused fingers" and "breathless" reaction to vision. Final choice to cite Kael’s paper reveals hierarchy of values via micro-choice, but internal conflict alternates rather than acts simultaneously at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: cicada reveal crystallizes relationship shift with visible cost in Kael’s "wistfulness." Accumulative lens holds through vision’s "syrupy" water and "pinwheeled" stars reweighting time’s texture. Cost proof clear in "anger softened into recognition" anchoring the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting where tidal pool’s "minute waves" literally constrain perception during vision, charging the final image. But environment doesn’t actively alter tactics beyond atmosphere—e.g., stars enable vision but don’t force a choice shift like the cicada does.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Ayla’s agency: her tangential approach triggers the vision, narrowing options from rupture to reconciliation. Dominant stake (generational knowledge transfer) signaled early via "bitter words" over bryozoan recording; cost is legible in Kael’s softened anger showing his fear of obsolescence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cicada’s life cycle and tidal patterns without abstraction; ending’s "I think I understand now" reweights the opening argument through earned resonance. Avoids moralizing—Kael’s flaws persist ("unwittingly threatening to stifle hers") while time’s "texture" answers the central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in marine-biologist noticing ("phosphorescence," "anemone") with rhythm modulating from tense short sentences ("silence... heavy cloth") to flowing vision prose. One filter verb ("she did not just remember") is voice-motivated; psychic distance shifts intentionally during foresight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "syrupy" water during vision shows brilliant specificity without muddle. Final line "endless, patient stars" recharges opening imagery with propulsion. Borderline "cathedral of the sea" justified by reverence, but no artifacts dull closure—figurative language earns density through payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "master-apprentice rift" trope via marine biology specificity (bryozoan phosphorescence, tidal transitions). Risk-taking in gentle vision heightens emotional truth; cicada’s life cycle as time metaphor feels inevitable. Avoids safety middle by keeping Kael’s rigidity intact without redemption.</comment>
