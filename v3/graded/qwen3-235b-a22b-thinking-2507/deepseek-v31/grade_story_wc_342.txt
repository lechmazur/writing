<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied perception ("fingers stroking fractally precise carvings") and contradictory impulses (inadequate pigments vs. needing "something more"). Final choice to craft an "echo" earns closure through prior causality, though motivation for "mirroring the sky" lacks deeper roots beyond artistic impulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the groaning building and Elara's "perfect stillness" crystallize cost through juxtaposition. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fractal pattern density escalates to the coin revelation, reweighting stakes with the demolition's roar. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tree trunk library’s "packed earth and gnarled roots" constrains choices (hiding the safe) and charges the final image (damp paper scent vs. celestial glow). Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: "sigh of settling stone" sharpens to "minuscule ridges" on the coin. Micro-setting as setting fully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: fractal pattern density intensifies from wall to coin to safe lock, narrowing options to the hand-press solution. Cost is unmistakable in the building’s "groan" and Elara’s foreclosed preservation path. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fading melancholy" of pigments vs. "solidified moonlight" reweights "discovering limits" without moralizing. Final image ("a window into a forever") resonates as earned wisdom, avoiding sentimentality through the demolition’s physical cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "fractally precise carvings" and "topography of immense complexity" reflect Elara’s spatial focus. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the coin revelation paragraph ("not scratches, but a language..."). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propulsion falters slightly with "her heart hammered against her ribs" (cliché) and "spark of understanding ignited" (mixed metaphor), but "pigment began to glow, a cool, blue-white light that seeped into the stone" showcases crystalline rhythm. No loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist and fractal mechanics feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural structure heightens stakes, but "scholar’s guild" trope slightly dilutes originality. Emotional truth in "she would not paint a portrait. She would craft an echo" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
