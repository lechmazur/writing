<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitude vs truth-telling) drive the pigeon dispatch choice with visible cost; embodied emotion in "residue of alertness" avoids labels. No therapy-speak during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "listening for footsteps that had not yet come" crystallizes stakes. Minor causality stretch in pigeon's arrival slightly undermines inciting incident.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard evolves from sanctuary to command center, constraining choices (using own pigeon there). Final image recharges "layered tranquility" with cost, though west ridge physicality could deepen earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency: follower → pigeon → lateral intuition → dispatch. Cost legible in "grim purpose" foreclosing passive solitude; dominant stake (truth vs lie) tightens through one decisive turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "quiet beat of wings" reweights integrity without moralizing. Final image answers central question by transforming solitude into resistance, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: meteorological precision bleeds into political insight ("seismic echoes"). Rhythmic control under pressure shown in shortening sentences during realization. No POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rustle of a leaf seem deliberate" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor scaffold in "motivation clarified instantly" avoids overwriting. Final line propels closure with crystalline rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of whistleblower trope through meteorological lens; "quiet beat of wings" as resistance feels inevitable. Avoids dystopian clichés via sensory grounding, though "rogue quarantine" lacks transformation.</comment>
