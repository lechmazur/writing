<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Alistair’s shift from collector to scribe, but "sensitively perceptive" remains label-only without embodied tradeoffs during the diary crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: grief crystallizing into writing ("become the wall") reconfigures stakes with felt cost ("profound grief settled over him"). Accumulative lens holds relentlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The silo’s "bronze quiet" and frayed tapestry constrain choice—Alistair’s tactile tracing triggers the axis revelation, charging the final image where he writes into that same silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Alistair’s agency ("probe the collection"), but the displaced axis concept arrives via diary exposition, slightly weakening causal escalation under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "tomb for stories" reframes collecting as autopsy, then writing becomes the resonant answer—no moralizing, just the silent scribe holding space for future echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice’s perceptual signature ("scent of aged paper," "embroidered eyes holding a secret") modulates flawlessly from observation to grief; rhythm tightens as pressure mounts without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels atmosphere or revelation ("half-burned diaries... spine cracking in protest"). Final image’s "bronze quiet" recharges the opening with devastating weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historian-as-tomb-scribe transforms apocalypse tropes; specificity of "reclaimed silo library" and tapestry’s "raised threads" grounds cosmic stakes in tactile humanity.</comment>
