<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details (oil-smudged fingers, pocket gears) and embodied emotion; contradictory impulses (failing hope vs. inherited duty) drive the climax. Slight abstraction in "deep-seated need" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the spinning vine reconfigures healing as remembrance; cost is visceral in "she had not fixed it; she had remembered it." Accumulative lens holds with perfect density escalation from dew drips to moonlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brass sphere constrains tactics (catching echoes) and charges the final image; dew, moss, and canopy actively pressure choices. Micro-setting excellence elevates to 9-band by shaping the remedy's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the moon's descent ("precise celestial event" creates a live clock); Elara's agency drives escalation from weak melody to resonant tapestry. Cost legible in the vine's transformation from "withered and grey" to "shimmering" green.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "remembering vs. fixing," crystallized in the final line without moralizing. Golden stories reweight history as tangible healing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears like fallen leaves," "luminous, impossible orange") with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; syntax tightens during the moon's descent while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "The music swelled... pulling light from the moon" advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing through music" trope via tinkerer's brass sphere and literal story-spinning; emotional specificity in "pockets full of gears" grounds the fantastical. Avoids derivative safety with unique golden-thread mechanics.</comment>
