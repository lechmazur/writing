<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bargained innocence" vs. "transaction he would make again") embodied through tactile micro-choices (thumb tracing crack, closing box as "key"). No stock phrasing; "primary tooth and grey hair" devastates via concrete specificity, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("strength was not absence of brokenness... holding pieces together") reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("scars mere seconds in dance"). Accumulative lens holds, but reflection on fire family slightly exceeds BRR (19% word count), narrowly avoiding momentum loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Porcelain box functions as micro-setting: its crack constrains choice (thumb pressure), charges final image ("relic no longer, but a key"). Moonlight bleaches color to "essence and shadow," shaping perception during pivotal reflection beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating pain without forgetting) deepens via protagonist's reflection on tooth/hair, narrowing options to "speak not of glory." Cost legible in "his own pain was not unique," a conceptual price that reweights survival as communal verse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through porcelain box's evolving meaning (devastation → key), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("stars as witnesses to quiet enlightenment") reweights "bargained innocence" as shared human cost without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: firefighter's tactile lexicon ("wrestle hose line," "sifting tragedy") colors moonlight as "silver light bleaching color." Rhythmic control in climax ("hard softness... steel core wrapped in acceptance") modulates pressure perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor paraphrase loop: "pain was real and sharp, the hardness... softness was the understanding" slightly dilutes closure beat. Otherwise, zero scaffold; "charred cabin" to "lunar light" progression achieves high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope via porcelain box's specific contents (tooth/hair). Emotional truth in "strength was holding broken pieces together" avoids generic trauma narratives. Fresh synthesis: cosmic insignificance ("scars mere seconds") fuels human connection.</comment>
