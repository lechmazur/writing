<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (harp tuning, tooth focus), but "modestly fearless" borders on label-speak; Kael’s shame-to-joy shift lacks contradictory impulses during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: laughter’s reverberation reconfigures Kael’s dissolution with felt cost ("sharp edges worn smooth"); accumulative lens holds through mist/harp density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo Gorge’s stone walls actively constrain choice (amplifying laughter), charging the final image; sensory specificity ("serrated tooth," "side-aching laughter") avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via harp dissonance prying Kael’s confession, but "flooded river" backstory lacks on-page pressure escalation; cost is legible though secondary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: laughter as healing weaponizes joy against despair without moralizing; final image reweights "luminous ache" into earned transcendence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in spectral details ("discordant hum," "frantic shimmer"); rhythm modulates from dissonant harp to pure laughter without POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "warped harp" metaphor sustains logic through payoff; every line advances atmosphere ("hush of hidden sunrise") or closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms soul-collector trope via crocodile tooth’s specific cultural weight; risks poetic density but earns coherence through gorge’s acoustic rules.</comment>
