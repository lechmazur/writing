<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aris's "glacial patience" versus heart-thudding vulnerability at the rosebush. Micro-choice to join Elara reveals hierarchy of values (truth over safety) with visible cost ("they won't listen to me either"). Elara's backstory slightly convenient but redeemed by embodied weariness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "stepping out... into the light" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (career risk). Orientation clear by 100 words; Accumulative lens holds through evidence-weaving. Cost proof solid in "they won't listen to me either" admission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivy-strangled station constrains choice (hiding place for pact) and charges final image ("ivy’s grasp"). Rosebush petal drop times pivotal meeting. Micro-setting (illuminated letter) physically shapes climax when held aloft. Library setting fades post-intro, slightly diluting cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. state lies) tightens via Elara's evidence chain, forcing Aris's shift from isolation to collaboration. Agency-driven deepening in "recapture it for everyone" redefinition. Cost unmistakable in career-risk admission. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Noble lies" theme emerges through phoenix symbolism and rosebush fragility, not statement. Final image ("shining and new, from the ashes") reframes "recapture" without moralizing. Slightly undermined by "active poison" abstraction but redeemed by concrete evidence-weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices pigments/script, not emotions. Under stress, syntax tightens ("Logic warred... scholar’s drive won"). Single POV stable; "conceptual cost" register drift minor. Elara's dialogue carries subtext through evidence, not pleading.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "fragile, beautiful letter" generic descriptor. Final line risks cliché ("into the light") yet saved by context. Strong propulsion via concrete verbs ("shedding petals," "wove a counter-narrative"). Minor overwriting in "glacier of focus" metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Historian trope transformed by specific pigment analysis and banned manifestos. Rosebush timing device feels fresh, avoiding "lone truth-seeker" cliché. Emotional specificity in Aris's rationality fracture elevates beyond template. Not revolutionary but distinctive synthesis.</comment>
