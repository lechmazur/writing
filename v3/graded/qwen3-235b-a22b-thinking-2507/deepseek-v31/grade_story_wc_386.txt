<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "weaves truth carefully" with tangible cost, but "desperate need" triggers label-speak deduction; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values through dream-cross-referencing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("silencing the Purser’s lie") under Accumulative lens; Reykjavik dream window provides causal escalation, though purser’s motive lacks full inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Glacial shrine constrains choice (candlelight on distorted glass enabling revelation) and charges final image ("ice seemed to hold its breath"); micro-setting meets 9+ gate by shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s dream-fragment assembly forecloses accidental explosion theory, but insurance fraud motive feels slightly undercooked for maximum causal inevitability under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through melted globe’s evolution from artifact to truth-container; final image reweights "borrowed starlight" without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crushing, silent depths where ships went to die") modulates under pressure, though "desperate need" slightly breaches POV lexicon in peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "borrowed starlight held fast in ice" does triple duty as setting/theme/closure image; only minor deduction for one generic phrase in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-whisperer trope through dream-cameo mechanics; melted snow globe as distorted truth-container transforms familiar elements with emotional specificity and conceptual risk.</comment>
