<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (monument vs. movement) deepens through embodied choices under pressure, but single-POV limits relationship dynamics per scope rules; "felt the collective grief take its true shape" avoids diagnostic labels while showing micro-choice evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "grief was not a monument, but a path" crystallizes stance with visible cost (redefining his craft), sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by 80 words with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse micro-setting actively constrains choices (mossy bench location, glass roof for butterfly light) and charges the final image; "thundering calm" reweights environment as emotional conduit, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through Accumulative lens via sensory density ("river of Monarchs," "chorus of murmurs") narrowing options to retrace ribbons; cost legible in "rain would run down the letters like tears," though migration timeframe lacks tactical urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (ribbons→carving flow, butterflies→grief's movement); final image reweights "monuments" without moralizing, though "profound and endless turning" slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whisper of tools on granite," "sweet rot of forgotten plants") modulates rhythm with emotional intensity; voice remains consistent under pressure with no head-hopping, though final reflection risks over-articulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops with high density, but "thundering calm" and "river of Monarchs" risk stacked metaphors in high-pressure beat; strategic telling in backstory avoids momentum loss, final line charges closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms gravestone trope through butterfly migration motif; "grief as path/vine" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
