<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "chronological homesickness" made visceral through numb fingers and fossilized labyrinth; avoids diagnostic labels except near-clunker "conductor of unheard symphonies" in peak action (-0.3).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: exhaustion buckling knees makes cost legible, and "ache was now a melody" crystallizes stance; orientation clear by breath-pluming in frozen lake (50 words), avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nautilus shell constrains choice (mapping memories onto spiral) and charges final image (warm from dawn); "frozen lake" and "brittle cold" narrow perception to immediacies under crisis without white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exhaustion countdown tightens tactics ("had to act before exhaustion hits"), forcing final gesture; cost visible in buckled knees, but "dawn" resolution edges toward coincidence without deeper causal link to memory mapping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "nautilus as fossilized labyrinth" reweighted to "warm shell" at closure; avoids moralizing though "cryptic fortune cookie" metaphor slightly strains organic emergence near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "breath plumed in upturned hush" and sensory hierarchy (cold > sound > light); rhythm modulates from staccato symphony build to flowing dawn resolution without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "frosted glass awaited. This was her podium" avoids paraphrase; slight density dip in "cryptic fortune cookie writer" metaphor (-0.2) but no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-symphony with "mirrored horizon" reconfiguration; avoids trope safety via specific "angle of light through nursery window" details and bold structural commitment to accumulative lens.</comment>
