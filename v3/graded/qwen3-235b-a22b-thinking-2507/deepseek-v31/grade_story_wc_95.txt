<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through Valerius' mechanical precision vs. human touch at the sundial; micro-choice of saluting instead of pressing advantage reveals hierarchy of values. "Diplomatically fierce" trait lacks sufficient embodied demonstration beyond the foil retrieval nod.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: the competitive tension transforms into partnership, crystallized when they approach the pane together. The lens (Causal/Accumulative Hybrid) holds perfectly through the geometric payoff, with the mechanical arm's precision enabling the decisive angle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass atrium functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—the tinted pane reveal—while the mechanical arm constrains Valerius' tactics throughout. Brook atmosphere remains ornamental; specificity shines in the sundial's faded gold leaf guiding the critical alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Valerius' feint forcing the 45-degree guard, narrowing options to one decisive geometric solution. Cost is legible in the shift from opposition to silent partnership, though the singular stake lacks deeper moral calculus beyond the shared goal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically: "violent poetry of conflict into tangible truth" crystallizes in the final image without moralizing. Subtext in the dignified chaos motif avoids thematic echo, though the "questions into destinations" phrase borders on abstraction before earning resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Valerius' tool-focused noticing ("polished steel glinting," "painted arcs traced with human fingers"). Voice modulates from analytical ("profound and deliberate purpose") to visceral ("clattering across the stones") under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gleaming steel that was both violent and supremely elegant" exemplifies high-density prose. Final image propulsion is flawless, though "diplomatically fierce" slightly drifts into label-speak before earning embodiment at the foil retrieval.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fencing-as-cipher decoding feels inevitable in hindsight, with mechanical arm specificity transforming the trope. Risk-taking in the geometric closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the atrium setting leans slightly generic despite strong integration.</comment>
