<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels; "wistfully pragmatic" shown through soil aeration despite knowing marigolds "couldn’t truly dispel sadness." Contradictory vulnerability (exposed yet safe) deepens her quiet defiance, though secondary pressure from neighbors remains implied rather than tested on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: the rose’s death ("final petal dropped") precedes "new kind of blooming," making renewal feel earned. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each mirror adjustment tightens emotional focus until the harbor "holds its breath," crystallizing connection from solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fire escape garden actively constrains choice (rusting iron, hard-packed soil); the gauge tooth’s precision enables her work. Final image recharges the harbor from "cruel indifference" to active witness, proving micro-setting charges closure. No decorative details—every element pressures action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: will her "small defiance against the gray" pierce the building’s gloom? Escalation via protagonist agency—angling the mirror to illuminate specific photos/walls narrows options to intimate connection. Cost is legible in the rose’s demise preceding renewal, tightening the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "reflect light into dark corners" becomes tangible via mirror shards hitting photos. Final "new kind of blooming" reweights the rose’s death without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete stakes (dormant lavender, calibrated tool).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: harbor as "shimmering mercury," soil aeration as "rhythm of oars." Voice modulates with pressure—lyrical in calm ("crimson sigh"), precise in action ("smooth, steady pulling motion"). Zero POV drift; lexicon stays grounded in her gardening focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character. "Quivering hush" evolves meaningfully without redundancy. Figurative language serves character ("beacon of purple"), never obscuring the closure image. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with mirror adjustments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "small kindness" trope through lockmaster’s gauge (precision tool as trowel) and harbor’s shift from indifferent to witness. Emotional specificity—her knowing marigolds "couldn’t truly dispel sadness" yet acting—avoids generic hope. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
