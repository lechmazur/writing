<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stubborn hope vs. crushing loneliness) act simultaneously in the observatory scene; final choice to align the shard earns closure with visible cost in the "crushing weight of failure" moment before the hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: the hum’s vibration and silver beam reconfigure options with felt cost (the crushing weight dissolving into "thistle-blown hope"); causal lens holds through prism placement, though box discovery edges toward convenient coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thistles constrain choice (signpost for star path) and charge the final image ("needle of thistle-blown hope"), but the Glass Humming Pavilion’s humming remains atmospheric rather than tactically constraining Elara’s alignment attempt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara’s agency: seed discovery → prism calculation → alignment crystallizes her stance; cost is unmistakable in the "crushing weight" before the hum, narrowing options to one fragile beam.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the thistle seed’s journey reweights "coincidences have meaning" into a resonant answer about survival signals; no moralizing, only the final image declaring "someone... survived" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("past whispered through touch," "shard of hush") with rhythmic control; tension compresses diction ("For a long moment, nothing happened") without POV slippage, though "crushing weight" slightly echoes generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("a needle of thistle-blown hope sewing a thread across the void" charges closure); minor deduction for "a quiet, stubborn thing" drifting toward tell-y abstraction in early motivation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition applied to cosmic navigation transforms beacon tropes; "shard of hush" embodies emotional truth without gimmickry, and the thistle motif’s specificity passes the transformation test decisively.</comment>
