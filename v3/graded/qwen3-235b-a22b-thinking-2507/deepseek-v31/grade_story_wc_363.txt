<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in her despair yet persistent weaving; embodied emotion via stained fingers and cold despair; micro-choice to revisit rummage box drives plot. Mentor memory slightly convenient but anchored by physical cue (amber bead). Final renunciation of loom earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "She would never have to recommence" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (loom's destruction). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—silence density increases until bead reveals source. Orientation clear by para 1; puzzle solution slightly convenient but pressure tightens via unraveling tapestry. Cost legible in "loom was gone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Threnody Orchard and loom function as micro-setting that constrains choices (daily weaving) and charges final image (loom's absence). Bamboo forest whispers and amber bead's light create tactile specificity. "Stoically sparkling" thread motif evolves meaningfully to closure. Final puzzle image recharges prior rummage box detail with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stopping raveling silence) signaled early; pressure tightens as silence actively unravels tapestry nightly. Agency shown via Elara's puzzle assembly and loom destruction. Cost is visceral (life's work destroyed) and conceptual (message delivered through time, not space). Puzzle solution edges toward coincidence but framed as earned method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sacrifice reframed as ending labor, not enduring it. Final puzzle image ("smiling woman at rest") offers non-literal answer to "latent sacrifice" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in concrete action (unweaving loom). No thematic echo—cost reweights "message across impossible distance" into temporal healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fingers stained with dye and memory," "whispering pear trees." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("raveling silence began to spread"). Purposeful elision (mentor memory) taught via amber bead cue and paid off in solution. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during bead revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("weaving the subtle sounds of growth and decay into tangible, stoically sparkling tapestry"). "Stoically sparkling" slightly overused but evolves meaning. Final image ("puzzle now showed a perfect, clear image") avoids closure muddle. Minor register drift in "fossilized breath" but voice-motivated by mystical context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: weaving as temporal message-carrying reframes sacrifice trope. Emotional specificity in "cold and familiar companion" despair avoids abstraction. Bold risk: puzzle as star chart transforms rummage-sale cliché into organic solution. Proximity check passed—no famous echoes; "raveling silence" feels newly embodied in tapestry unraveling.</comment>
