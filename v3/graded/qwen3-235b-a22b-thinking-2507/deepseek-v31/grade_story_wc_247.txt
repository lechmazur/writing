<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is embodied through her micro-choices (camera use, signing shift), but "joyful sorrow" risks thematic echo as near-label. Contradictory impulses (obscurity vs. connection) deepen her endurance, though the child remains functional rather than character-rich.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: silence density builds to the yacht's intrusion, then deepens into Charged Poise closure when the engine cuts. The cost—"left alone in the timeframe when no one remembers you"—reweights her obscurity as earned stasis, crystallizing the symphony's fleeting impact without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The harbor constrains choices (pier location for signing, water's reflection as translation medium) and charges the final image ("liquid silver" now heard). "Luminous" specificity elevates beyond postcard description, though deeper sensory texture (e.g., harbor smells) could heighten immersion under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (silence as presence vs. noise) tighten through Elara's agency: her signing—not fighting noise—reconfigures the conflict. The yacht's intrusion escalates tension causally, but the resolution leans slightly on coincidence (child noticing her). Cost is palpable: the audience's brief reverence alters nothing long-term, yet "the music had been played" lands with earned weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: silence as music isn't stated but embodied in the signing climax and the harbor's "richer than mere absence" resonance. The final image ("picked up her vintage camera... smile on her face") reweights the premise without moralizing, making "joyful sorrow" an earned emotional aftereffect rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("weight of a sleeping cat’s breath," "hollow shape of regret"), with rhythm mirroring quiet intensity. Minor register drift in "joyful sorrow" repetition risks thematic echo, but voice remains consistent under pressure—especially in the signing sequence’s tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean and resonant, but "joyful sorrow" recurs as near-synonym churn (e.g., "intense, joyful sorrow" → "soliloquy of joyful sorrow"). No closure-dulling artifacts; final line’s "music had been played" delivers crystalline propulsion. Density occasionally edges toward overwriting in descriptive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the "wise elder" trope through specific tools (camera/signing) and emotional complexity—obscurity as chosen vessel for connection. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative silence) heightens stakes coherently, with the harbor’s "presence" offering a fresh angle on environmental resonance that avoids cliché.</comment>
