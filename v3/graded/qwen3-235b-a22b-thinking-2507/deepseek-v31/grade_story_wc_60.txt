<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s luminous skepticism manifests in embodied contradiction: her fingers meeting warm glass after expecting illusion, transforming patience into action. Final silent witness earns Earned Stasis with visceral cost—the box’s fading light—as her skepticism yields to measured starlight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "the city was still forgotten, but now, it was no longer silent" crystallizes reconfiguration with conceptual cost (box’s purpose fulfilled). Accumulative lens holds—dust motes and geese returns tighten pressure toward celestial alignment without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Forgotten fountains constrain choice: dry basins supply dust-mote breadcrumbs, while the stained glass box’s physicality (warm glass, constellations) charges the final image. Micro-setting (dust motes) directly enables the liberation, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency—sidereal patience narrows options to celestial alignment, with visible cost in the box’s fading light. Geese returns mark a live clock, deepening pressure under accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: sound (not water) as liberated memory reweights "forgotten" without moralizing. Final image—"no longer silent"—offers resonant answer to the central question, avoiding sentimentality via physical specificity (roaring cascade, ghost of joy).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "luminous skeptic" filters details (gritty silence, pallid gold coat), with rhythmic control modulating from "feathery quiet" to the climax’s cascading syntax. Zero POV drift; compression (seven days) taught early via geese returns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "defiant echo against the enduring silence" achieves triple duty (image/theme/closure). Figurative language sparse yet potent ("captured sunset"), with final line recharging "forgotten" motif flawlessly. Peak beats avoid muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope via dust-mote breadcrumbs and sidereal mechanics. Emotional truth in skeptic’s quiet victory avoids abstraction—specificity (Cygnus alignment, roaring water sounds) synthesizes freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
