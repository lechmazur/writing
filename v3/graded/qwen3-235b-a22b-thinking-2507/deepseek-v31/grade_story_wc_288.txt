<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brittle awakenings" and ancestral shattering fear, but reincarnation backstory floods as exposition without anchoring micro-choice (e.g., no hesitation touching sundial). Final endurance earns cost through smoothed edges, yet peak stress lacks degradation—thoughts remain lucid during resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density ("groan of ancient mechanisms," "fractured reflection") tightens toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable in "brittle awakenings did not shatter; they softened," with lunar tide’s turn crystallizing stakes. Orientation anchors by word 15 ("petrified wood citadel above cloud-veil").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stone circle hum constrains the climax choice (low-tide descent) and charges the final image ("peaceful ghosts upward"). Tidal mechanics aren’t backdrop—they dictate timing, while the sundial’s reflective face evolves from mirror to window, reweighting extinction through concrete action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coexisting with grief) escalates through Accumulative lens: each sensory detail ("sigh of wind," "fractured reflection") deepens isolation until the hum’s resonance forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in softened edges—a felt price paid for independence without erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: layered extinct species as "phantoms made of light" reweights "bloody history" without moralizing. Final line ("alone but no longer lonely") offers non-literal resolution, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity through concrete reconciliation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—"tides of memory," "spiritual entropy"—with rhythm shifting from brittle short phrases to flowing resolution. Minor register drift in "quantum scale" slightly clashes with curator lexicon, but compression remains purposeful and legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies (e.g., "groan of ancient mechanisms" establishes setting, sound, and time passage). Final line recharges opening cloud imagery. Only flaw: "atomically reflective" repeats without deepening, risking near-duplicate density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms extinction tropes via specific mechanics (sundial measuring spiritual entropy), with emotional truth in "let it live, without letting it dominate." Bold risk in poetic density heightens stakes, though "reincarnation memory" setup leans slightly familiar despite fresh execution.</comment>
