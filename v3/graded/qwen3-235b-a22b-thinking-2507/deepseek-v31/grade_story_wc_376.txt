<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs. physical vulnerability) drive micro-choices; final renunciation of silence earned through embodied cost in the cavern scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "she did not wilt. She grew" crystallizes conceptual cost (truth as sustenance) under causal lens; persistent constraint (wilting) shapes tactics throughout descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wilting trait functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges final image; greenhouse bones pressure choices via damp walls and shifting aquifers during critical beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: plumber's admission narrows options (truth as path forward), with visceral cost (leaden limbs → restored strength) legible in "washed over her like cool water".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "lost conversations" into literal sustenance without moralizing; thematic resonance emerges from spring's "waterfall of whispered conversations" concretizing abstract truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("calligrapher’s eye for form") modulates under pressure; plumber dialogue’s subtext ("afraid") avoids thematic echo while advancing plot through character-specific lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "waterfall of whispered conversations" slightly redundant but redeemed by closure image’s conceptual payoff without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis (truth as hydrological resource) transforms drought trope; emotional specificity in "sallow skin" avoids generic eco-parable while heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
