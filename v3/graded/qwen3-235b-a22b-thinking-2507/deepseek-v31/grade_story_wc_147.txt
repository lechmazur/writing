<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to harness the ephemeral" remains abstract despite clear goal; interiority lacks contradictory impulses during crisis (no hesitation before unstoppering vial). Diagnostic label-speak ("ephemeral," "collective consciousness") triggers penalty without embodied cost in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase (silence→churning→charge) culminating in valid Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "memories settle, a symphony... entrusted to him," but distress signal causality breaks when Elias is revealed as sender mid-story without prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: crystal vial and "gathered hush" constrain choices (movement pace, oxygen-deprived decisions) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—crisis narrows to light/rhythm while calm admits "velvety fabric" of silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve consciousness vs. survive) tightens meaningfully via oxygen alarm, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the leviathan's appearance feels coincidental rather than arising from Elias's actions. Cost is legible but pressure isn't driven by his choices until climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "library of moments captured in light" transforms into Elias's burden without moralizing. Final image reweights "lonesome splendor" into shared stewardship—a resonant non-literal answer to preservation vs. oblivion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frail trespasser in grand hall," "tsunami of force and teeth") modulates rhythm under pressure. Deep third POV stays consistent; compression in memory vision taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("stirring millennia of gathered hush" then "thick, velvety fabric woven from centuries") slightly dull momentum. Otherwise high density—e.g., "oxygen alarm blaring" conveys physical/emotional stakes in one phrase without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms underwater temple trope via specific, grounded choices: consciousness preserved as "nebulous light" in perfume vial, guardian as "loyal curator." Fresh inflection—ephemeral harnessed through surrender, not capture—avoids safety middle.</comment>
