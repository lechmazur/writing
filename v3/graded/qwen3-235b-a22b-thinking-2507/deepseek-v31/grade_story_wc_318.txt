<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("heart heavy stone yet spirit straining") and embodied grief ("tears dried by wind") avoid therapy-speak; micro-choices like nozzle tilt reveal hierarchy of values with cost. Final choice (walking toward laugh) earned through vocal exhaustion and fuel depletion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("walked through dark tunnel toward sound") crystallizes options with visceral cost ("voice gone, fuel sputtered"). Accumulative lens holds: sound layering reweights grief into connection. Cost legible in "macerated pieces settling into foundation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tunnel acoustics actively constrain choices (intake adjustments, nozzle tilts) and charge final image (pull cord as "key"). Leaf blower functions as micro-setting: its "resonant thrum" shapes tactics and closure. Avoids white-room syndrome through sensory choreography ("wind rushing past").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("restore lost laughter") tighten through protagonist agency: vocal exhaustion and fuel depletion narrow options. Escalation via sound layering ("sonic tapestry of shared pain") reweights grief under Accumulative lens. Cost ("voice gone") visibly alters tactics, charging final image of walking toward light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("macerate memory into compost"), not abstraction. Final image ("haunting over; tending begin in light") reweights "true haunting" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via visceral cost ("waterlogged laugh" after vocal destruction).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ragged, broken thing" for voice) and rhythmic control ("roaring foundation" to "shaky chuckle") modulate under pressure. Zero head-hopping; compression ("mournfully eager to begin") taught early and paid in closure. Lexicon stays character-bound ("macerate" fits gardener).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "sonic tapestry" multiplies meaning without muddle. Sentences vary rhythm ("He yanked the cord" vs "Tears streamed...") to mirror pressure. Final line ("tending could now begin in light") recharges "dust sheet" motif with earned specificity. No figurative clutter in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: leaf blower as grief ritual transforms gardening trope through acoustic specificity. Emotional truth ("screeching tires into fading sigh") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (sonic catharsis) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible through causal sound physics.</comment>
