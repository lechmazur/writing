<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (archivist calm vs. heart quickening) but lacks visible flaw-driven struggle; micro-choices like sitting among lavender reveal values without tangible cost escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with descendants viewing photos—the cost of unspoken intergenerational pain crystallizes in the hush; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with vines climbing as pattern-break reweighting resilience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lavender field functions as micro-setting charging closure: wild blooms on poisoned earth constrain choices (planting as faith act) and reconfigure the final image’s meaning through scent/bees contrasting decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (transmuting pain) tighten via Elara’s agency gathering descendants, but cost remains conceptual; felt cost of collective despair isn’t dramatized through a specific loss altering tactics during escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lavender’s reprise: final image of healed town heart reweights "transmuting pain" without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by grounding hope in concrete acts like planting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dove gray map case," "soothing scent" filtered through archivist’s lens), but "earnest whimsy" phrasing drifts into abstract commentary, slightly muddying POV consistency under thematic pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but "perceptively calm" repetition (opening/ending) creates minor scaffold; final line’s "peaceful feeling linger" slightly overwrites the earned image with tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-healer transforms trope through specific puzzle-work; risk-taking in quiet closure elevates stakes without gimmickry, though lavender symbolism edges toward familiar resilience motifs.</comment>
