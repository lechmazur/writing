<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (caution vs mischief), embodied in bolt choice with stinging palm cost. Slight tell in "virtuously mischievous" label prevents 9+; otherwise micro-choices under pressure feel authentic and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: diamond-fused bolt crystallizes stakes with visceral cost ("stinging palm") and conceptual shift ("wider and weirder"). Causal lens holds perfectly—pressure escalation narrows options to one decisive, self-preserving trick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm sets atmosphere but under-pressures choices; bolt (micro-setting) shines as indispensable constraint charging the final image. Sensory details vivid yet slightly generic in crisis ("air screamed" lacks character-specific filter).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (disintegration vs survival) escalate through Elara’s agency—her bolt gambit forecloses self-sacrifice with physical cost (sliced sleeve, stinging palm). One tightening suffices, though "translate pressure" motivation could deepen earlier friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: pyramid scheme trauma reframes "volunteer" as rebellion, culminating in non-literal diamond-as-wisdom. Avoids moralizing; final line reweights "shadowseam wonder" with earned cost, no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cold calculus," "virtuously mischievous") modulates under stress with rhythmic compression. Minor dip in "quantum promise" explanation disrupts POV lexicon—elevated diction clashes with survivor voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-synonym loop ("terrifying clarity"/"snapping into place") slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise clean: final line’s rhythmic payoff ("wider and weirder than any she had ever tried to sell") ties theme to trauma with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum physics meets pyramid scheme skepticism via bioluminescent farm. Risk-taking (redefining "volunteer" as object-trick) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors the weird.</comment>
