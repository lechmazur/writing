<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fear traded for desperate curiosity" and the flute-blowing micro-choice, but "harvest insights from failure" risks abstraction without enough embodied struggle in the reflection beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "hush feeling different now—not empty, but full of potential" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost, though the Accumulative lens could be tighter in the fissure transition beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The thunder-echo range's "avalanchingly quiet" hush constrains every action (driftwood markers as silent navigation) and charges the final image—micro-setting excellence where environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara steps into the monochrome realm, making "ghosts of choices" visceral; cost is unmistakable in "painful clarity," though the single escalation beat lacks deeper knowledge transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "to weave between worlds, one must first unravel oneself" is earned by her abandonment of driftwood markers, avoiding moralizing while resonating with brutal specificity in the final walk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound was a currency spent long ago") and rhythmic control under pressure, but "brutal, beautiful insights" slightly veers into pat abstraction during peak emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gilded instrument grew warm, pulling something from her—not air, but intention" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line recharges driftwood motif with flawless specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms relic-keeper trope through sound-as-currency specificity and emotional truth in quiet restoration; "tapestry’s underside" metaphor feels inevitable, avoiding derivative world-weaving clichés.</comment>
