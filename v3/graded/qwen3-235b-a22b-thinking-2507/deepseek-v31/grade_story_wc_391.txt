<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("impatience was a living thing" vs "sculpt patience") drives the climax; embodied emotion peaks with "heart a frantic drum" transforming into "impulse slough away" with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("impulse slough away") under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors in 18 words; lens clarity proven by density escalation to "sigh" revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary constrains choice (charts etched on rock) and charges final image (glowing scripts); "perfected ice" lens reweights setting's purpose with concrete cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (patient revolution vs impatience) tighten through sensory accumulation; cost crystallizes in "slough away" moment; agency as vigilant witnessing forecloses impulsive action under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversal: "revolution was not an attack; it was an awakening," with final ice lens reweighting premise without moralizing; avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mercury-bright gleam," "stone waking") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in "savage cold, untamed rock" triplet; zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "bejeweled and alive" risks purple prose but justified by rain-droplet physics; final "perfected ice" image achieves maximum density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "revolution" trope through geological patience; "restrained wildness" specificity avoids abstraction; risk-taking in quiet climax pays off via earned resonance.</comment>
