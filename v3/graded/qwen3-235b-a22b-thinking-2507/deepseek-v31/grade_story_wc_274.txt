<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("preservation, not examination" vs. "scandalize the memory") drives action through embodied choices (bypassing security layers), avoiding label-speak. Final endurance ("no going back") earns cost via irreversible breach of sacred duty, though micro-hesitation during console scene could deepen conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "The archive was no longer a tomb; it was a witness" crystallizes the conceptual cost with undeniable pressure. Causal lens holds throughout—from letter discovery to broadcast—with "no going back" proving visible cost in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Vault’s silence and frozen infrastructure directly constrain choices (dormant networks as only escape route) and charge closure: "frozen truths humming all around her, waiting" transforms the setting from sterile tomb to active witness, reweighting its meaning through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency: her decision to use dormant networks narrows options from "file or reveal" to irreversible action. Conceptual cost ("monument of lies" detonated) is unmistakable in "no going back," reconfiguring the dominant stake through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the final image ("the conversation had begun") resonates as a non-literal answer to "should buried truths stay buried?" Avoids moralizing while reweighting the Vault’s purpose through Elara’s irreversible choice, with no false balance toward the architects’ atrocity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crisp paper," "hum of stasis fields") filters urgency through archivist’s precision. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: short, staccato sentences during broadcast ("She routed it...") contrast with lyrical reflection, avoiding uniformity even in crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances multiple elements ("plume of breath the only cloud" conveys isolation, consequence, and physicality). Peak beats avoid figurative muddle—"truth was loose, traveling at light speed" propels with crystalline clarity while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms archival trope through specific sci-fi logic (cryogenic library, emergency-alert networks). The "dormant networks" solution synthesizes world rules and moral calculus into a fresh, inevitable turn that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
