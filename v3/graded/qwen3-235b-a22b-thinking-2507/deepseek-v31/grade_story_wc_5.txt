<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (flash-paper alchemist seeking permanence) manifest physically in patience rituals and final sealing act. Embodied grief avoids labels; "deep valley of absence" shows rather than tells. Slight underdevelopment of how alchemist identity conflicts with current work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: depleted starlight and "latent image" foreclose further attempts. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through sensory density ("glacier-rose petals" to "cold, brilliant fire"). Orientation flawless by paragraph 1; cost legible in "safekept starlight... dark, its purpose fulfilled".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: "moving stillness" enables ritual, orchard supplies materials (petals, bones), and gnarled trees' shadows join the map. Micro-setting (copper plate, alembic) charges closure via "latent image waiting for a sympathetic heart." No generic descriptions; every detail serves the process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around capturing ephemeral grief permanently. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: petal arrangement triggers starlight flare, raising cost (only one chance). "Cold and brilliant" fire and depleted starlight deliver felt cost under Accumulative lens. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: permanence of grief ("map that would outlive her") vs. transience of life. Final image reweights "flash-paper alchemist" identity through "cold and brilliant" fire, avoiding moralizing. "Silent testament etched in metal and memory" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "air itself felt thick with anticipation," "breathing so slow it seemed to stop." Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical for setup, taut for climax. Elision ("moving stillness" concept) taught early and paid off in closure. Zero head-hopping; voice remains embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid silver she had spent a decade condensing" shows not tells. High density: "sharp peak of final words" compresses complex emotion. "Cold and brilliant fire" avoids cliché. Minor deduction for "profound silence" slightly generic, but closure image ("latent image waiting") remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy trope through emotional specificity: "translating heartbeats into maps" feels fresh. Orchards as grief witnesses avoids nature cliché. Risk-taking in quiet climax ("thrum" not bang) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative elements (starlight) made indispensable via "safekept" process.</comment>
