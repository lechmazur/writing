<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Albino sensitivity grounds perception, but serene anger resolves without embodied contradiction; micro-choices like ink dilution feel authentic though the intellectual epiphany lacks visceral struggle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with drone's unmaking as conceptual cost, but the abstract "fragile skin of reality" slightly dilutes tangible stakes; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through ink pattern density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spilled ink functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (dilution experiment) and charges the final image; moonlight-on-ink mechanics are purpose-driven, avoiding decorative symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through ink experimentation, but the eclipse's "crisis" remains off-page; drone disappearance provides conceptual cost yet lacks visceral personal stakes narrowing Silas's options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ink's transient patterns reweighting reality's "permanent blinding" layers; final image avoids moralizing while delivering resonant non-literal answer to time-perception question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "pink-rimmed eyes" and tracker's focus, but "serene anger" borders on abstraction; rhythmic control falters slightly in the drone's "fading" description with redundant whirring references.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion in "cold twilight bleeding" opening, but "fragile skin of reality" creates a borderline mixed metaphor; minor synonym churn in drone descriptions ("falter," "unraveling," "disappear") slightly dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tracker's POV with ink-based time-perception mechanics avoids sci-fi tropes; albino specificity transforms familiar eclipse premise, though "consciously wild" feels slightly over-signaled without tactical cost.</comment>
