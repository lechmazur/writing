<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "desperate curiosity" hints at cost but lacks embodied tradeoffs. Strength: micro-choices like angling the nickel reveal values, yet emotional stakes remain conceptual rather than visceral during pivotal dome climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("vibration of possibility") delivers undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly: each sound interaction tightens the sensory pattern until the dome's note reconfigures certainty into infinite curiosity without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as active micro-setting: the parabolic wall enables the nickel's resonance, directly constraining Elara's angling tactics. Final image ("restored murals... waiting") charges closure by making the garden's "listening" palpable through environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara's agency: her angling choices narrow options from decoding the nickel to the dome's sun-dependent note. Cost is unmistakable in "traded her certainty for the entire universe’s curiosity"—a conceptual forfeiture that forecloses static restoration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "exchange certainty for curiosity" crystallizes when the dome's note spawns "more beautiful questions." Final image reweights murals as "silent and profound, waiting," avoiding moralizing while resonating with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("powdered ghosts of forgotten pigments") sustains under pressure, though "dizzying sight" slightly drifts into generic description. Rhythmic control shines in the dome climax's short sentences, but minor lexicon inconsistencies prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("whispering grasses" compresses setting/theme). "Vibration of possibility" achieves crystalline propulsion in closure. Near-flawless density, though "determined hand" borders on stock phrasing in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope via acoustic specificity: the nickel's grooves require precise physics, not whimsy. Freshness lies in making curiosity a tangible cost ("traded certainty"), though the celestial mural slightly echoes familiar restoration tropes without full reinvention.</comment>
