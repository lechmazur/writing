<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "accepting fear without letting it in" lacks layered irrationality. Final choice earned but emotional progression too calibrated, missing hypocrisy or self-deception in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("settling deep in his soul"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: pattern break (constellations) tightens to density increase (garden's feral lullaby), reweighting stakes through cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rail spike as micro-setting charges closure ("anchored by a understood grief") and constrains mid-story choice (pressing thorn). Late first appearance as mooring pin (midpoint) narrowly avoids setup cap, but reprise is indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Nereus's calm composure against sonic chaos ("feral lullaby") under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in soul-deep echo settlement, but secondary stake (constellations) lacks tactical integration beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-resonance emerges through concrete particulars (hollow space in music, tear-shaped void). Final image reweights "patterns break" into constellations finding home without moralizing, achieving non-literal thematic answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("breaths measured against erratic rhythm"), voice modulates under pressure with purposeful compression. Zero head-hopping; rail spike's "cold, heavy" texture embodies Nereus's lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "shimmering hedges of solidified melody" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final line crystallizes motif with propulsion ("anchored by a understood grief"), though "tooth-filled nightmares" slightly strains metaphor coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Greek myth (Nereus) with sonic physics avoids tropes through tactile specificity (rail spike as mooring tool). Risk-taking heightens stakes via Accumulative pressure, but emotional complexity lacks one transformative inflection for 9.0.</comment>
