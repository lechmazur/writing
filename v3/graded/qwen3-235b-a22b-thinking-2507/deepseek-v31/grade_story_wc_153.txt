<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's simultaneous clinging to and release of the letters, but "psychic ache" edges toward therapy-speak, slightly undermining embodied emotion in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with felt cost ("weight... gone from her spirit"), though the window frame's appearance lacks sufficient causal setup within the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard as micro-setting constrains choices (drawing on glass) and charges the final image ("cool, hard truth against her skin"), meeting the 9+ gate with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via textural density (spirits' song intensifying, condensation blooming) drives Elara's agency under Accumulative lens; cost is unmistakable in "deep, psychic ache began to soften."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("apology was no longer waiting; it had been felt") delivers resonant, non-literal answer to central question without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read history in a discarded button") and rhythmic control excel, though "fierce tenderness" repetition slightly dilutes voice modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose like "clutched in her palm was her compass" does triple duty without figurative muddle in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spiritual quest and emotional resolution transforms tropes; "messages in condensation" feels inevitable in hindsight while heightening stakes.</comment>
