<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elara's "brightened disquiet" fuels forbidden interfacing, but "fierce, compulsive curiosity" lacks embodied specificity. Final choice to nurture (not catalog) the inheritance earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "her life, once a straight line, was now a ring" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—density of sensory details (porcelain glint, vacuum perfume) tightens toward revelation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the bathroom's sterile porcelain becomes essential when the shell vision shatters it, charging the final image. Archive's "crystalline stacks" lack pressure until the shell reprises meaning, narrowly missing 9+ gate's constraint requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate purely through Elara's agency—locking herself in the bathroom narrows options to forbidden knowledge pursuit. Cost is visceral: "trembling" hands and the archive's quiet becoming "a threshold" reweights her entire existence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "legacy wasn't a straight line but a tangled knot" gains weight via the orchard's nonlinear inheritance. Final telescope image answers "what is legacy?" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hummed with the weight of centuries" and vacuum's "cold and infinite" perfume. Minor register drift with "brightened disquiet" (therapy-speak) undercuts pressure, preventing 9+ despite rhythmic control during vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trees of silver and gold bore fruits that were distant, swirling galaxies" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line avoids sentimentality while recharging the shell motif—"a universe" now "held" in her pocket—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "nonlinear inheritance" trope through specific, verifiable details (pistachio shell cameo, cleansing chamber). Emotional truth in "bewildered curator" inheriting cosmic genesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (bathroom as sacred space) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
