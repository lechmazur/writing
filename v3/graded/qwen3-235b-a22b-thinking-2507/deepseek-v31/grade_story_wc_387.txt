<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ren’s contradictory impulses (humble laborer/philosopher) manifest in tactile net-mending and the firefly rescue; Lin’s thin characterization slightly weakens relationship dynamics despite the earned closure beat where she grasps his philosophy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Lin’s realization ("audacity was not in the whistle") crystallizes the stakes with visible cost (worldview shift), sustained under the Accumulative/Textural lens without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bamboo whisk constrains choices (mending spirit/net) and charges the final image (steam rising), but "scintillatingly somber" remains a label without embodied constraint, narrowly missing the 9.0 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving firefly patterns) tighten through Ren’s agency (net-mending), yet pressure lacks escalation; the cost (disoriented fireflies) is legible but doesn’t transform tactics beyond the single rescue beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: moon paths and net-mending reweight "hidden patterns" without moralizing; the final image ("perfect, hidden whole") delivers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mossy stones murmuring") and rhythmic control shine, but "scintillatingly somber" violates Ren’s lexicon as academic register drift in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("ephemeral laborers," "moon-led way"), but "scintillatingly somber" is a register artifact that slightly dulls atmospheric momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the "wise elder" trope through specific, lived detail (river-grass nets, moon-path navigation); the firefly rescue’s emotional truth feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in thematic restraint.</comment>
