<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "burden and promise fused" and "enable not command," but micro-choices under pressure lack visible struggle; the kite discovery feels convenient rather than earned through her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with the moss’s "green approval" crystallizing her insurgency’s cost; the Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (steam, plants, script) reweights destiny’s meaning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Volcanic springs actively constrain choice—steam nourishes the embryo at climax—and the recurring kite charges the final image; every detail (petrichor, geothermal mist) serves the theme’s organic growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the decoding process, but Elara’s passive reception of "implanted destiny" lacks active conflict escalation; the cost (relinquishing control) is felt but not wrestled with in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"till the soil of recovery" reweights tradition—avoiding moralizing; the final image’s "seeds not shouts" offers non-literal resolution without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "secret symphony of green" and plant-guided decoding; rhythmic control under pressure ("sighing click, sound of a door opening") teaches the lyric pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "amber embryo quivered, scent of petrichor bloomed," but one filter-verb stack ("she knew she must unseal it") dulls immediacy in a mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "insurgent grandmother" with ecological telepathy feels inevitable; risk-taking in using plants as script-decoders heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming trope into lived detail.</comment>
