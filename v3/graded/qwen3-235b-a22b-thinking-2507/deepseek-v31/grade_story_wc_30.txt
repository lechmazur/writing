<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s embodied fear-to-awe arc feels earned through concrete contradictions (tears of sorrow/joy), but lottery selection lacks motivation. Librarian’s "preserve wonder in routine" drive is flawlessly shown via clockwork-tide synchrony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with visceral cost (Elian’s shuddering acceptance), but orientation delayed past 120 words: "massive, quiet figure" reveals setting late. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through moon-phase pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium functions as micro-setting (seawater pulses constrain ritual timing), but "wintersun serenity" remains static despite emotional escalation. Basalt plinth matters for creel placement yet lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("hold contradictions without breaking") deepen via Elian’s pivotal acceptance, but escalation relies on moon phase (external) not agency. Single tightening suffices for length, yet visible cost (tears) doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "preserve wonder in routine" crystallizes in Elian’s expanded calm. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights premise through "timeless" eyes without stating wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct voices shine (Librarian’s "reed instrument" vs. Elian’s formality), but "profound joy and bottomless grief" edges toward therapy-speak. Rhythmic control mirrors tidal pulse yet lacks stress-induced compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"A thousand loves, a hundred thousand regrets" creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beat. Otherwise stellar specificity ("ancient and smooth bamboo"), but redundancy dulls closure’s emotional density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Titan-gear librarian transforms archetypes via "sculpted metal/warm ceramic" duality. "Smelt" metaphor for identity transfer feels fresh, avoiding derivative tropes through concrete ritual mechanics.</comment>
