<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s shift from resignation to action via ribbon-triggered realization; embodied emotions avoid therapy-speak ("breath caught," "feistiness melting"). Slight causality gap in her sudden clarity, but micro-choices (tying ribbon, descending) earn the final stance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Councillor’s widened eyes at the apple’s flavor + ribbon crystallize reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost (lost wisdom). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory/textural deepening (ribbon spill → apple offering) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices (Elara’s decade-long isolation in rafters) and charges the final image (ribbon-adorned apple as wisdom symbol). Sensory details like "roots woven through saintly statues" serve urgency, not decoration, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: Lyra’s urgency forces kit spill, ribbon memory deepens stakes, apple handoff crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable—physical descent from rafters and surrender of isolation—under Accumulative lens where textural density reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "deciduous vs. evergreen vows" reframes wisdom as connection, not isolation. Final apple offering resonantly answers the central question without moralizing; Councillor’s widened eyes show conceptual repricing where sweetness = preserved insight in unlikely places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures ("fragile weave," "dappled light"), Lyra focuses on practicalities ("rotten floorboards"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during storm), with no head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly filters "endearingly feisty" through Elara’s view.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops—each sentence advances story ("crumpled decree in lap" shows resignation). High density: "roots woven through saintly statues" establishes setting/theme in five words. Minor cliché ("feistiness melting") redeemed by "quiet ache"; final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "save the home" trope via quartz-eyes metaphor and cathedral orchard specificity. Fresh inflection: "deciduous vows" applied to parent-child bonds. Emotional truth in "we were both blind" avoids sentimentality; risk-taking resolves conflict through quiet offering, not confrontation.</comment>
