<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("sacred duty") is clear but interiority shows no irrationality or struggle under pressure, missing 9+ gate despite strong embodied emotion ("heart hammered"). Flaws don't complicate choices—she succeeds without tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly under Accumulative lens: "plaster dust sifted down" crystallizes conceptual cost of decay's acceptance. Orientation anchors early; lens holds without contradiction through water's reagent role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flooded setting constrains choice (tuning cello to water) and charges finale ("still water" reflecting)—micro-setting of water/cello meets 9+ gate. Sensory detail reflects urgency: crisis narrows to "lap of water" amid gloom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara's realization ("not meant to be played, but felt") escalates to vibration disrupting foundations. Cost is unmistakable—"plaster dust sifted" reweights decay as release under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (water revealing cipher, vibrations settling dust), not abstraction. Final "deeper silence" offers resonant answer to decay's inevitability without moralizing—avoids Thematic Echo flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musician's focus on sound ("unstruck chords," "resonant frequency") with rhythmic control matching tension. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during "wordless conversation" with Maestro.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "sigh of the building" slightly overwrought but voice-motivated. Zero loops or scaffold—sentences do double duty (e.g., "water around her knees began to ripple" conveys vibration and setting).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost score" trope via water-as-reagent mechanics and conceptual closure. Emotional specificity in decay-as-release avoids cliché; "transformative note" inflection feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
