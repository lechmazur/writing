<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "bleak exhilaration" as contradictory impulses (horror vs. possibility) drive the mirror choice; embodied trauma avoids labels through concrete geode ritual and sensory overload during awakening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: permeating the mirror pool reconfigures options with felt cost (integrating trauma into potential), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts; circuit breakers' cooling creates irreplaceable time pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode and mirror chamber constrain choices—vibration during downtime enables the awakening, and the dormant telescope's pool becomes the locus; "ozone and cold metal" anchoring by line 30 fuels tactile urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Escalation via sensory deepening narrows options under Accumulative lens: the observatory's "screaming static" forces pursuit of the mirror's potential pool, with the klaxon's return charging the final image through irreversible system restart.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of the telescope hunting "invisible spectrum" reweights "unused potential" as active co-creation without moralizing; trauma's "dark current" within the pool embraces complexity, avoiding false balance while resonating through concrete mirror symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "heat ghosts" and "stress points"—Kaelen’s fractured psyche shapes sensory selectivity; rhythmic control intensifies during awakening ("unfiltered awakening tore through him") with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "symphony of overlapping, half-seen frequencies" exemplifies high-density propulsion where every phrase multiplies meaning; final line’s "invisible spectrum" recharges the geode motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through specific physics metaphors (perturbation theory as awakening catalyst); the observatory’s "pool of pure potentiality" synthesizes sci-fi and grief into a non-obvious emotional calculus that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
