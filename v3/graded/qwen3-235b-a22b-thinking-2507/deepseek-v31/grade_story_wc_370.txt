<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete: empathy as "raw nerve," failure as "cold stone." Final choice earned through embodied contradiction ("bracing for shame... but it did not come"). Slight abstraction in "fragile but persistent thing" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: "leaving her past error neatly on the shelf" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visible emotional cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught early via sensory density and held through "roaring library/coexist" realization. Orientation solid by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: crumpled invitation (frayed edges, "silent pull") constrains every choice. Library's "internal light" books charge final image, but setting itself doesn't alter tactics—lacks one actionable constraint for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: hiding invitation → physical journey → re-reading error. Cost is undeniable in "leaving error neatly on shelf"—shame released but identity transformed. Midnight deadline vitalizes pressure without cliché.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "nested paradoxes" realization, not stated. Final image ("walked out... whole") reweights "enlarged tranquility" without moralizing. Near-miss on 9+: "monument to hubris" slightly abstract, but redeemed by concrete error-analysis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "scent of old paper," "frayed gilded edges" filtered through recluse's bias. Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato for panic ("heart pounding"), fluid for epiphany. Zero head-hopping; compression taught via invitation's "gravitational force."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Propulsion impeccable until "fragile but persistent thing"—minor abstraction in high-pressure beat. Otherwise, high density: "cavernous space defied shop’s dimensions" does triple duty. No loops; final line’s "new night, whole" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Nested paradoxes" transforms redemption trope into intellectual rebirth. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off—no confrontation, just internal recalibration. Lacks one fresh inflection beyond premise (e.g., library mechanics), but "staying while leaving" synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
