<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shrewdly innocent" paradox and silent engagement with Kaito; embodied "lotus-hearted ache" avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "fragile, foolish faith" phrasing lacking immediate physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with cost: "ghostly weight... paralyzing charge gone" reconfigures trauma. Accumulative lens holds through coral motif recurrence. Only microscopic flaw: "fractal maze" description slightly over-explains the coral's significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brain coral functions as essential micro-setting that constrains choice (pocketing it, surgical application) and charges the final image. Misty atrium lacks active pressure despite early signal; "damp marble" specificity elevates but doesn't alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when coral discovery drives Elara to seek surgery—a meaningful tightening with visible cost (enduring PTSD's "ghostly weight"). Agency is protagonist-driven under accumulative lens. Surgery mechanism edges toward convenience but redeemed by coral's causal role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "grafting new meaning" reweighted in final image without moralizing. Kaito's drawing as "scream given form" avoids sentimentality. Closure's "old wound... grafted with quiet meaning" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chemical sea," "lotus-hearted ache") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early via anesthesia drift. Minor deduction for "calm above his mask" phrasing bordering generic in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractal maze of grooves" slightly overwrought but justified by context. Final line crystallizes theme without telling: "grafted with a new, quiet meaning" integrates metaphor and cost. Unmatched density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms PTSD trope through coral-as-neural-map synthesis; "shrewdly innocent" diplomat archetype made specific via Kaito interaction. Risk-taking in surgery-as-translation metaphor heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in "decrypting smudged notes" as inciting incident.</comment>
