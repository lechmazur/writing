<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses in climax; embodied emotion strong ("hand resting on cool brass") yet no visible internal conflict during charm operation undermines 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("horror integrated but no longer dominant"), but the felt price remains abstract—no physical or relational forfeiture beyond atmospheric shift weakens escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dune functions as active micro-setting: bioluminescence enables archive stabilization ("sways in silent wind"), and final image ("blossoms swaying in wind that carries ghost of melody") charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory intensification ("wriging like snake" to "shattered melody") drives agency; conceptual cost ("calm and enduring spark") reweights the dominant stake, though physical sacrifice would elevate tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cultivating sparks" motif; final image reweights darkness-to-light without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo while resonating via "calm and enduring spark" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flicker in/out of existence at edges of perception") and rhythmic control under pressure; quantum metaphors modulate with emotional intensity without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "fractured lullaby smooths" demonstrates syntactic variety, though minor paraphrase loop ("a state she maintains; it is occasionally everywhere") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archive trope via quantum mechanics and bioluminescent grief; "horror integrated but no longer dominant" offers non-obvious moral calculus that synthesizes novelty with emotional truth.</comment>
