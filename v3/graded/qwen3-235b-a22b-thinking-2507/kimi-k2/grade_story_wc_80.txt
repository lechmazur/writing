<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stoically sensitive" micro-choices like tracing cracks while writing "apologetic" notes, but internal conflict lacks sustained contradictory impulses during peak pressure (e.g., inkwell use feels purely ritualistic without hesitation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (inkwell's weight gain, silt sigh), but cost proof falters—"feeling its weight increase" lacks visceral specificity to fully satisfy the cost test at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The antique inkwell functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice (e.g., measuring absence via ink notes) and charges the final image (fluid bearing the pavilion's map), satisfying the 9+ gate through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via environmental pressure (drawbridge descent deadline) narrowing options, but protagonist agency in driving escalation feels secondary to atmospheric forces, missing the high-band requirement for decisive protagonist-led tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (measuring hollows, writing sonnets for lost objects), with the final image—"lantern lit from within by everything taken and refused to leave"—delivering a resonant non-literal answer to absence's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scallop bite of a cliff that had forgotten its own shape") and rhythmic control under pressure (shortening syntax at dawn) showcase mastery, though minor register drift in "hushed blaze of silence" slightly dilutes consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with high density ("sepia fluid smelled of cedar and old promises"), but "scallop bite of a cliff that had forgotten its own shape" risks anthropomorphism in a high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding coherence penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted pavilion" trope through surveyor's lens (measuring absence with calipers), but the emotional calculus lacks one fresh inflection beyond melancholy specificity to reach 9.0+.</comment>
