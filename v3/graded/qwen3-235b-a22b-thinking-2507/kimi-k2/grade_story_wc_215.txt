<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "vow to speak truth" versus "recording every silence," embodied through box-handling micro-choices. Ghosts' regret feels earned via propolis tears and smoker gestures, avoiding label-only emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: propolis tears solidifying and box locking "like a bee’s final wingbeat" crystallizes the weight of unspoken words. Accumulative lens holds through spiral hive pattern reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Charred hive legs as "charcoal stilts" and melted wax rivulets as runes constrain choices—recluse traces them to decipher the covenant. Final image of luminous bee ghosts blooming from the oasis charges the micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the woman’s ghost points to her unspoken vow, narrowing options to reading strips aloud. Cost manifests physically as the box "grows heavier" and emotionally via her propolis tears—agency drives resolution under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the covenant’s transformation from broken contract to collective confession, culminating in the resonant final image: "luminous ghosts of bees refracting the covenant’s light" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "wax and ash" lexicon and rhythm mirroring hive spirals. Ghost dialogue avoids exposition—"gaze that asked to read the covenant etched into the ruin" carries potent subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "scorched wasteland stretching like a burnt parchment" risks overwriting density in opening beat. Otherwise, syntax varies purposefully: short clauses for tension ("He added her strip"), flowing cadences for revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through beekeeping specificity—the covenant’s "weight of unspoken words" becomes tangible via pollen-carried secrets. Risk-taking in making silence the protagonist’s tool heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
