<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "grips reality loosely" stated not dramatized; final chronicle inscription shows earned endurance yet no visible micro-choice under pressure during key moments like the earthquake observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "dust regaining memory" reweights impermanence with felt cost of crumbling; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts, though minor causality gaps in the silence sequence slightly blunt pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Library setting actively constrains choices (vines blocking paths, mold dictating descent timing); obsidian refuge and origami swan function as micro-settings that charge the final image with "composted syllables" and cooling stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing without judgment) lacks escalation; no live option foreclosed despite "crumbling" cost, as keeper never faces temptation to judge—pressure remains observational rather than testing commitment under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (dewdrops as cities, equations with fingernails), but chronicle inscription’s "I judged it not" edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust thick with forgotten tongues") and rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early with "origami swan" mechanics paying off cleanly in transition sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-closure line "soft as composted syllables" achieves zero loops with high density; minor figurative muddle in "earless dark hummed—not sound, but absence quickening" avoids overwriting penalties due to consistent voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "regenerative silence" as fertile forgetting avoids timekeeper clichés; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes, though "hibernating beast" metaphor slightly echoes established tropes without full transformation.</comment>
