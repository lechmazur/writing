<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s dry wit as a "map" hiding coordinates shows embodied contradiction; her final choice to lay down the phrasebook (not retrieving predecessor’s) earns endurance with visible cost—the outpost’s groaning duty discharge. Micro-choices like speaking the phrase aloud reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake exhaling, current carving a channel south, and condensation freezing mid-sentence ("a single,") crystallizes irreversible cost—duty discharged with the outpost settling. Accumulative lens holds; cost is legible in the truncated final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The condensation pattern functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (her "clock" for action) and charges closure—reversing inward then freezing mid-thought. Ice’s thinning to "glass" directly enables the pivotal melting circle, proving environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally: the trembling condensation bead holding prolongs tension until the falcon’s dive triggers convergence. Lira’s agency (speaking the phrase, laying books spine-to-spine) drives the single decisive deepening—melting the ice circle—with cost paid via the outpost’s groaning surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "where the rivers begin" shifts from query to declaration as Lira tastes the "first syllable." Final image (current carving a pencil-line channel) reweights the quest without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through sensory specificity ("iron and snowmelt").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices "voweled murmur" and "soft ticking of contracting ice," with rhythm modulating from measured ("buckled loading dock") to urgent ("muted drum"). Elision (predecessor’s vanishing) is taught early and pays off in the fossilized phrasebook.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via textured verbs ("flaking," "trembled," "exhale"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("black comma against blank page")—no muddle in peak beats. Final truncated phrase ("a single,") sharpens closure without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartographer as editor hunting rivers’ origin through linguistic ritual. Transforms quest tropes via specific constraints (condensation clock, phrasebook physics). Emotional truth in Lira’s quiet resolve avoids generic templates; "worried tranquility" deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
