<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (claustrophobia vs purpose) manifests physically in wall-squeezing moments; micro-choices like whispering names to anchor herself reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost during phase transition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: facility collapse crystallizes Mara's shift from escape to witness, with tidal pressure tightening options under Accumulative/Textural lens; "hush following like held breath" charges final image with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gold fleck constrains choices (triggers phase shift) and charges final image as "lighthouse"; tidal mechanics make seawater's Morse code both atmospheric pressure and tactical clock that narrows movement windows during critical beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's singing transforming into binary lullabies deepens the dominant stake (restoring connections) under Accumulative lens, but tidal timeframe doesn't actively narrow options until collapse; cost is visible but pressure lacks protagonist-driven tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of gold fleck reflecting "weight of every story" offers resonant non-literal answer to "what remains" without moralizing; theme of connection emerges from cable repairs releasing specific memories (birthday call, last email) rather than abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "seawater dripped in Morse code" and "thunder wrapped in velvet"—distinctive sensory filtering through Mara's tracking gift; rhythmic control intensifies during phase transition with compressed syntax mirroring her bodily shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "binary lullabies" risks overwriting but earns density by linking singing to cable testing history; single paraphrase loop ("crashing hush" repetition) deducts 0.2 despite lyrical payoff in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes undersea cables with human memory in non-obvious "phase transitions" framework; "copper veins carrying consciousness" transforms tech trope through specific emotional calculus of severed birthday calls and drowned "I love you"s.</comment>
