<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "pushed away with the same tenderness she now extended to shadows"; embodied scars drive micro-choices like tracing the burn while remembering abandonment. Final renunciation of the sanctuary earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "carrying the loaded emptiness that was not absence but space." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the dissolving threshold and ring's transformation reweight stakes through sensory density, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ring (micro-setting) constrains every choice and charges the final image as "circle of light." Sanctuary walls breathing with her proves environment actively shapes the transformation, not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: pressing the ring to her sternum narrows options to "breathing through absence." Cost is visceral in "breathing in the ashes of every choice until the lungs learned to filter hope from regret."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically—the final image reweights "burned bridges" as "doors opening" without moralizing. Scars as "a map of every person pushed away" avoids abstraction, making wisdom feel earned through bodily experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "starlight pooled like spilled mercury," shadows as "absence made tangible." Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during suffocation) with zero head-hopping or voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ashes rising like starlight" achieves crystalline resonance. One borderline abstract phrase ("lessons through scars") is redeemed by concrete payoff in the ring's transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "burning bridges" through embodied scars and shadow physics. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—the suffocation metaphor gains inevitability from specific, verifiable details like the shoulder burn.</comment>
