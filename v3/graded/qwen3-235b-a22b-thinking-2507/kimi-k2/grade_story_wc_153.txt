<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fierce tenderness replacing shame") and embodied emotion ("ink turning to lead") drive credible change; micro-choices like re-slicing her palm show hierarchy of values. Lacks secondary character pressure but single-POV baseline fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: dissolved letters' bitterness replaced by "salt-sweet air" and scarless healing reconfigures the shard's meaning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density ("condensation bloomed... spelling words back") tightens the apology's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth functions as micro-setting: waterways "braided like memories" constrain navigation, while the shard (tool) charges the final image via crumbling dust sealing the cut. Sensory hierarchy ("brine and regret") perfectly filters through Lira's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unspoken apology) tightens through Lira's agency: blood-writing the blank letter narrows options to one irreversible act. Cost is visceral ("blood bead on empty page") but escalation lacks one visible trade-off beyond emotional weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "space between heartbeat and heartbeat" evolves from spirit-song to hollow in her chest, reweighted by the final "I choose to stay present." Avoids moralizing while answering the central question through embodied action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting their ink," "moonlight licking the cut") modulates rhythm under pressure. Non-standard punctuation (em-dashes for breathless intensity) is pattern-taught and legible; psychic distance shifts during spirit-dialogue deepen emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("paper crackled like dry leaves, words lifted off as steam") propels momentum. Slight register drift in "conceptual reweighting" moment risks overwriting but doesn't dull closure's visceral impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (unsent letters, spirit guides) through specific logic: mangroves storing messages via condensation, apology materializing as "living tissue." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the earned closure.</comment>
