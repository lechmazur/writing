<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "spreading curiosity" amid disintegration, but "becoming the question" edges toward abstraction. Micro-choices like pressing the halo to the willow root motivation, though the crayon maze callback lacks concrete emotional friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "her body now only a lattice of intention" and dispersal into "garden’s breath" reconfigure time’s texture under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3; lens holds through hyperbolic geometry escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Living bridge garden functions as micro-setting that charges closure: hyperbolic water steps constrain movement, mirrored leaves force confrontations with self, and final "trembling fabric" image reweights prior tactile details like "wet clay over broken glass."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency-driven escalation: disintegration narrows options from physical to pure intention, with visceral cost in "skin flaking into light." Final dispersal charges the image, though retrocognition’s mechanics slightly obscure immediate pressure in middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reprise: "fading photographs" become "soft thread in endless weave," answering "what time felt like" without moralizing. Final image’s "warm where love had walked, cool where sorrow waited" resonates through embodied specificity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates: "vines pulsing like slow heartbeats," "quaking reverie" filter all details through Elara’s tactile obsession. Rhythmic control under pressure ("floor tilting into ceiling") with no head-hopping; elision of second character taught through reflections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "time had a texture like wet clay over broken glass" layers meaning without muddle. Final line’s "soft thread in her new, endless weave" propels closure with crystalline density. No figurative clutter in peak disintegration beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze design with retrocognition avoids tropes through specific lived detail (halo fragment from forgotten saint’s statue). Risk-taking heightens stakes: conceptual closure as "trembling fabric" feels inevitable yet non-obvious, resisting abstraction.</comment>
