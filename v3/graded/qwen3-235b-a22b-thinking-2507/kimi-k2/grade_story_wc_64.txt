<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("blithe" vs grave duty) shown through humming and creaking knees, but "feels the weight of every seed" edges toward abstract reflection rather than embodied choice under pressure at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: dissolving door and midnight watering instructions crystallize the cost of choosing duty, with "knees creaking like old hinges" making the physical/emotional price undeniable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt silo's rust-lilac air and frayed tapestry border actively constrain choices (kneeling to untangle threads), while sovereign case's emptiness charging the angel's palm directly reweights the final image with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through tapestry revelations (mother's/own name), with the blank name forcing crystallization; cost is legible in dissolving garden vision and "knees creaking," driven purely by Liora's agency under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "I will untangle the rest tomorrow" reweights lilies/silk without moralizing, while cello-threaded lullaby offers non-literal resolution to forgiveness-as-choice, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized air") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control shines in sparse climax sentences, though "feels the weight of every seed" slightly over-tells.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax beats, but "velveteen gloom" repeats 3x without deepening meaning (mild synonym churn), and "tenderly organized like the first move" feels slightly forced in final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery trope via "intentions as tapestry" and sovereign case's transformation (coin→intention); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry as empty case fits angel's palm with conceptual inevitability.</comment>
