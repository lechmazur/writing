<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "operatively gentle" trait (cracking dictators yet leaving them convinced) and micro-choices like placing tokens silently. Kelis' arrival crystallizes the cost of her past actions without sentimentality, though minor backstory convenience slightly undermines professional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the clipboard absorbing tokens then becoming "lighter by the exact weight" makes conceptual cost undeniable under Accumulative lens. Final image of "planting ideals as seeds" forecloses her old treaty-signing identity with felt stakes, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (incised grooves dictate movement, pollen/geckos shape ritual) and charges closure via "footprint in radiant relief." Every sensory detail filters through Aurelia's diplomatic precision, with the clipboard's texture directly altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual object placement, but Kelis' silent arrival delivers the crucial deepening: his harmonica completes the circle, forcing Aurelia's endurance. Cost is visceral in "tasted sawdust from trees felled in a war," though escalation relies more on accumulation than agency-driven narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "flawed beauty" motif—terrace's pockmarks and asymmetry reweight at closure as seeds "needing tending." Final Mercury image answers the redemption question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars like "background radiation" war residue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: diplomatic lexicon ("velocity of bullets," "operatively gentle") modulates under stress into compressed physicality ("heel-to-toe along incised ecliptic"). Zero POV drift; even Kelis' entrance is filtered through Aurelia's restrained observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "midsummer light pooled like warm wine" establishes ritual temporality that pays off in "slow caravan of tomorrow." Minor lexical friction in "refugee glass" slightly jars voice, but zero loops/scaffold and rhythmic variation under pressure uphold 9+ standards.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope via bureaucratic specificity (clipboard as altar, treaty velocity vs seed-tending). Risk-taking (lyric structure, minimal dialogue) heightens stakes through "imperfect circle" motif, with Mercury's "flawed messenger" arc offering fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
