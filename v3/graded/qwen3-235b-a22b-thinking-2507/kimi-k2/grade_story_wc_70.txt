<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marisol's "involuntarily truthful" trait drives micro-choices (e.g., "I don’t know, but I hope so" to travelers) and crystallizes her final declaration with embodied cost; no diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via the tower's bioluminescent rebirth and Marisol's whispered riddle answer, reconfiguring the blackout's meaning with felt cost in "the cocoon phase" line; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lacquer box constrains choices (climbing tower, striking match) and charges the final image as "miniature sun"; "nectar dusk" evolves from sensory anchor to thematic vessel without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marisol's agency: solving the riddle transforms passive hope into action, with cost legible in reframing seven years of waiting as "careful tending of wonder" amid the drone failure's consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the riddle's answer reweighted by action ("wonder, always wonder"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reconfigures "preserving wonder" as active transformation without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper veins," "burnt ozone") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control peaks in the match-strike moment where syntax compresses to mirror tension without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density where "melted copper wings" simultaneously advances setting, character, and theme; final line’s "wonder, always wonder" avoids cliché through earned repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms drone-failure trope via "wonder" as tangible force; the riddle’s solution feels inevitable through prior particulars (her routine, the box’s discovery), not a clever twist.</comment>
