<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "trembled, reactively visionary" climax, but exile's cause remains abstract, slightly weakening motivation's causal chain to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("sky folded like parchment") reconfigures absence with felt cost in her trembling hand; Accumulative lens holds perfectly through fragment accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Harbor cobblestones as "blank margin," raindrops as "syllables," and barnacles as "pages" actively constrain choices and charge the final sail-image with undeniable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through barnacle whispers and lexicon assembly, but societal collapse remains off-page; cost is emotional (trembling hand) not tactical, limiting escalation's visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Theme emerges from "negative space" metaphor reweighted by final sails; avoids moralizing through "compile fragments into meaning" as embodied action, not abstract thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ocean-spray archivist" noticing ink-bled labels as "bruised clouds") remains consistent; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's folded sky.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "barnacles shivered, opening tiny doors" achieves textural density without muddle; only minor register drift in "reactively visionary" label repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes exile narrative with archival poetics: "trumpet valve as pupil" transforms heraldic object into meaning-making organ, feeling inevitable through concrete harbor logic.</comment>
