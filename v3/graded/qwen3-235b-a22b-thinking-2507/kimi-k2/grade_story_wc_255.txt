<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "innocently cunning" trade-off: craving color yet bartering memory-costing awakenings. Embodied emotion in "tears she could not color-code" avoids label-speak. Micro-choice of tucking reed tongue "beneath its leaves" reveals hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "no longer searching for colors... but for the cracks that let the light in" crystallizes stance with visible cost ("bartered another awakening"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; final image reconfigures beauty with conceptual cost ("conversation" cut-off implies ongoing imperfection).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass shards actively constrain choices—Lira "kneels among shards," uses marbles/vines as tools. Final image "cracks that let the light in" directly charges closure by transforming setting into thematic engine. Micro-setting (courtyard) defines all actions and the cost-paid realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake ("find beauty in imperfection") tightens through three arrangement beats, narrowing options until the final trade. Agency-driven escalation: each "arrangement" deepens sensory cost ("painful and bright" memories). Unmistakable cost in "tears... slipped down her cheeks" charging the ivy dome closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; final truncated line ("beauty was not the absence of flaw, but the conversation") earns resonance through prior particulars. Central question reweighted by ivy dome—"forever growing, forever broken"—showing beauty as active dialogue with imperfection, not abstract ideal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira’s colorless world filtered through heat/fracture ("light fractured," "tasted of iron"). Rhythmic control peaks in "cracked the air like thin glass." Calder’s dialogue lacks voice distinction ("Trade what?"), slightly diluting two-character potential.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("quivered like a trapped moth" excepted as minor cliché). "Rustled, though no wind stirred" creates simultaneity error, but prose propulsion ("courtyard exhaled. Color surged") elevates closure. Final line’s truncation avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "bartering sight" trope through glass/crackle specificity. Emotional truth in "feel the shape of seeing" avoids abstraction. Risky lyric structure pays off: fragmented phoenix framing deepens the "cracks" motif without gimmickry, making imperfection feel inevitable.</comment>
