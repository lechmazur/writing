<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "curator vs courier" realization; embodied emotion in "heart ticking like a clock" avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: no visible struggle between collecting compulsion and courier duty during pivotal diary reading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "stories are not chains but wings" reweights memory's burden. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as diary layers build toward dissolution. Cost proof: palm-press acceptance of loneliness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reclaimed silo library functions as micro-setting: ashes' unnatural warmth constrains Elara's actions, while tapestry threads charging the final image ("dragons becoming part of the silo’s grain") satisfy 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory preservation) tightens through diary sequence, but displaced axis never constrains tactics—planet groans externally without altering Elara's choices, missing Band 8.8+ escalation requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "stitching past to present" reconfigures memory as liberation. Final image ("stars no longer strangers") offers resonant non-literal answer to forgiveness question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bronze quiet" synesthesia and dragon "snouts." Rhythmic control peaks in layered voices ("single bronze chord"), with pattern taught early via wall hums and diary cracks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "spine cracked like a bird’s wing." Minor flaw: "sensitively perceptive" appears twice as label without showing cost, risking scaffold penalty (-0.1) in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: medieval tapestry as prophetic object transforms memory tropes. Risk-taking in sentient architecture feels inevitable through concrete details (Morse code indentations, warm ashes), avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
