<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo's contradictory impulses (calm ritual vs. unresolved grief) act simultaneously in scene; burning the euro earns endurance with visible cost (charred circle). No therapy-speak—emotions embodied through money-folding and boundary walks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: paper fence confuses drones, burning euro forces retreat with undeniable conceptual cost (charred circle). Accumulative lens holds—currency density reweights "loop" stakes from trap to cradle without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned train constrains choices (boundary walk, cage seating); recurring money charges closure (burning euro). Sensory details filtered through Leo’s priorities ("whiskey on breath," "puddle of moonlight") avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mara reveals demolition—Leo’s fence-building forecloses departure with tactical cost (currency expended). Escalation driven by agency: money placement directly alters drone behavior, reweighting "loop" as generative not futile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: Möbius strip logo → paper fence → burning circles. Final image ("dreams of paper money burning") offers non-literal answer to "loop" question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via ritual action over exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusky harmony," "watermark showed trapeze artist mid-flight"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences for tension ("She nodded"), lyrical cadence for reflection. Dialogue subtext ("You rob time") reveals history without explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("bills tucked into cracks like territorial markers" does triple duty). Figurative language precise ("flapping like tired flags") without muddle. Final line ("prayer flags") recharges money motif with closure weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: crypto-startup collapse meets circus train via money-as-territorial-markers. Bold risk using ritual (burning euro) to resolve drone conflict—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in Leo’s quiet endurance avoids generic templates.</comment>
