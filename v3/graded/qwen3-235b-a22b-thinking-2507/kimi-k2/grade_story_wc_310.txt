<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (doubt/enthusiasm) act simultaneously; dissolution choice earned by prophecy realization with visceral cost. No diagnostic label-speak—emotions embodied via coin adjustments and resin vibrations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "nothing mattered, therefore everything did" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through static intensification; orientation clear by line 3. Cost proof: "coins fused into single lens" reconfigures purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coins function as micro-setting, constraining choices (millimeter adjustments shift prophecy) and charging final image (fused lens). Resin walls evolve from "creaking" to "softening," mirroring Mira’s dissolution. No generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stellar doubt vs. enthusiasm creates authentic tension; one tightening (prophecy shift from "will have aligned" to "did align") changes knowledge decisively. Cost is visceral—dissolution charges the final beam. Agency drives every escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "backwards prophecy" mechanics: purpose as retroactive recognition. Final image ("next universe would hear her laughter") reweights contraction without moralizing. Avoids false binaries—doubt and wonder remain "twins."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cosmos filtered through commerce ("fossils of commerce"). Rhythm modulates under pressure ("static clarified into a voice—her own voice"). No POV slips; "quietly enthusiastic" refrain deepens under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("pressed," "nudging," "tuned"). Final line crystallizes theme without telling. Figurative language serves pressure ("resin walls vibrating like vast cello")—no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic entropy viewed through commerce (coins from dead civilizations). "Backwards prophecy" transforms cliché via retroactive fulfillment. Emotional truth in finding purpose within dissolution avoids gimmickry.</comment>
