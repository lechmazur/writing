<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira's tactile perception ("tasting the metal's memory") versus abstract truth-seeking; embodied cost lands when "the weight... settling into her bones" precedes her empty-gloved resolution. Minor over-articulation in final lines ("weaving between worlds had become her ordinary breath") edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively: sealing the shard reconfigures the bay into a map with visible cost ("gloves empty"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure escalates via sensory density (parallel mechanics, console revelation) narrowing options to one irrevocable choice. Orientation clear by line 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The green shard functions as micro-setting, constraining traversal ("closed fist around it") and charging closure by becoming a "quiet lens" in the floor. Sensory specificity ("welding sparks drifting like fireflies") evolves causally from rust to resonance, avoiding symbolism through lived-in tactile use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Lira's choice to take the shard from the slot (not coincidence) forces confrontation with the truth's unbearable weight. Cost is unmistakable—"tears freezing" then "gloves empty"—under the Accumulative lens where emotional density reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "truths wait to be spoken" resonates because the withheld truth literally killed the pilot. Final image ("chart not worlds but the spaces between them") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through earned sensory logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent and sound rather than light" for star charts) modulates rhythm under pressure—lyrical cadence fractures during console revelation. Slight register drift in "ordinary breath" risks abstraction but stays grounded by tactile closure ("dawn touched derelict landing pads").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels: "the bay folded like paper" compresses setting/action/metaphor. Final line recharges opening's "dying star" with "dawn touched derelict landing pads," avoiding figurative muddle. Minor deduction for "ordinary breath" slightly diluting embodied closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms parallel-universe trope through sensory mapping: the "truth" as a moment, not place, feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes—cyclical structure pays off via the shard's stillness—without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in "pilot's final thought: coordinates... where truth could be spoken."</comment>
