<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emil's contradictory impulses (doubt vs resolve) manifest physically through the chip's dimming; his final truth declaration earns Midnight's transformation with visible cost in the essence exchange. Midnight's shift from shadow to child feels slightly rushed despite setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands with undeniable cost: Midnight's sacrificed essence and revealed vulnerability crystallize the thematic shift. Causal lens holds perfectly—"I will mend" directly triggers the covenant's recoil and fusion. No orientation debt; stakes pay off in the fused gear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The resonance chamber's parabolic design actively multiplies Emil's song to combat rust, constraining every choice. Chamber acoustics charge the climax when notes "multiply like mirrored swallows," making environment indispensable to the final image of "luminous chords" restoring dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Emil's agency: his doubt-induced falter forces the truth declaration, narrowing options to "mend until the world sings." Cost is legible in Midnight's recoiling essence and the rust's active resistance, tightening pressure under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fused gear of "twilight and dawn"—a non-literal resolution rejecting binaries. Children's "sunrise they had never seen but somehow remembered" reweights fear/silence vs song without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details: rust as "soft red snow," gears humming "like sleeping bees." Voice modulates from quiet tension to luminous urgency without syntactic monotony; no head-hopping despite Midnight's introduction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels action ("rust loosened, falling away"). Figurative language stays precise ("dawn in pale gold rivers") without muddle. Final line's dissolution avoids flourish, preserving closure clarity through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "covenant of rust" from cliché into active antagonist that "knits new scales." Midnight's fear-of-living motivation reframes time theft as psychological rather than fantastical, with emotional specificity avoiding trope reliance.</comment>
