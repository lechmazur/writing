<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "sad expression" labels emotion without physical manifestation. Micro-choices under pressure (applying ink pellet) are strong but the central conflict remains externalized. Flawed competence shown through centuries of study yet final action lacks visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "library settled into its new, honest configuration" crystallizes truth's cost with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds through marginalia pattern-breaking. Constellation pause creates live clock; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library functions as micro-setting: scrolls correct themselves, shelves shiver, constraining Thimble's choice. Dust motes and ink pellet charge final image. Overwritten celestial metaphors occasionally dilute immediacy but final "starlight and shadow wove together" earns 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. fabricated history) tightens via marginalia pattern accumulation. Ink pellet application forces irreversible trade-off (end of guardianship?); cost felt in "innocence lost." No secondary stakes dilute focus. Agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete unraveling: "words lifted from the page" reconfigures truth's nature without moralizing. Final "story finally told true" resonates conceptually. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction; cost lies in pretender's exposure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "cryptic messages left in library books" filters all observation. Rhythmic control shines in "graceful collapse had begun" cadence. Zero POV slippage; tension modulates through sentence length. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "centuries of pacing marble floors... centuries of learning its curves" (redundant time framing). Otherwise high density: "darkness that pulled at the edges" conveys rune mechanics vividly. Final line achieves textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-as-guardian trope: pretender exposed through marginalia he created. Emotional truth in "justice served and innocence lost" avoids sentimentality. Bold risk: entire conflict resolved through textual manipulation, not physical confrontation.</comment>
