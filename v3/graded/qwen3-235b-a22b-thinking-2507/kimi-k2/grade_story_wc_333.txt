<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (bold fingertips vs fear-gate's minor key) and embodied emotion ("melody fluttered against ribs"), but 7-year quest lacks dramatized micro-choices under pressure; motivation clear though reflection on cities feels summarized not lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise RR: "melody completed itself, each note settling into cracks like seeds" crystallizes options with visible cost ("staggered, drunk on released possibility"). Orientation clear by para 2; accumulative escalation through sensory density holds lens without flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ribbon) charges closure when tied to wrist, while nexus cobblestones actively constrain ritual choices. Sensory hierarchy perfect—"cedar and thunderstorm" scent filtered through locksmith's memory shapes action, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: disorientation deepens sensory immersion, narrowing options to memory-key. Cost legible in "staggered, drunk" physical toll; dominant stake (freeing melody) forecloses fear's path via earned renunciation of metal key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("notes settling into cracks like seeds") offers resonant non-literal answer to "secrets wanting song" without moralizing. Theme emerges from burned score particulars, avoiding thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "clocks striking hours that never existed."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "cobblestones drinking violet dusk" reflects locksmith's ritual focus. Rhythm modulates under pressure (fragmented phrases during disorientation) with no head-hopping; Aelira's dialogue carries subtext through "voice trembling like dew."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances atmosphere/character ("shadows lengthening like curious fingers"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle—high-stakes "frantic wings beating" metaphor earns its place; final "seeds" image crystallizes with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's block" trope through specific mechanics: fear as iron gate forged from laughter, ribbon as key. Emotional truth in "fear wearing neighbors' faces" riot avoids cliché; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
