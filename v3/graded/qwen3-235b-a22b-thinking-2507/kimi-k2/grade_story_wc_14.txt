<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in studious panic versus creative urgency; micro-choice to speak textures aloud reveals hierarchy of values when lamp fades. Final endurance earns closure via prior causality, but flaw (obsession risking present reality) lacks sufficient testing to hit 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: silence thickens but "no longer empty" after lamp dies. Accumulative lens holds through texture-density escalation; persistent constraint (time before lamp forgets) shapes final image. Cost legible in "the silence returned, thicker than before."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lamp hum constrains choice (Liang must speak before it fades) and charges final image ("notepad warm against his ribs"). Bonsai labyrinth evolves causally with lamp's glow, avoiding static description. Micro-setting (notepad's cedar-scented paper) directly enables texture-collection stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving pre-silence textures) tightens as lamp's hum "thins into a question," forcing Liang's vocal intervention. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost (irreversible memory loss) charges final silence. Lacks one visible price paid mid-beat to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "invented histories were not lies but lanterns" reweights prior texture-collecting without moralizing. Final image ("pages luminous with restraint of everything not forgotten") offers resonant answer to memory's purpose. Avoids thematic echo despite profound insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measured silence the way others measured rain") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression ("each invented history began with a texture") taught early and paid off in closure. Zero head-hopping; lexicon stays within Liang's stationer/studious voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "powdery sigh of pollen" exemplifies textural specificity. High density ("lamp brightened... as if grateful to be remembered") advances character and stakes. Final line's "restraint of everything not forgotten" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "memory preservation" trope through tactile textures and lamp-as-archivist. Specificity anchors universals: "slap of carp tails" feels lived-in. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently, but one fresh inflection ("refracting sound into phrase") slightly limits 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
