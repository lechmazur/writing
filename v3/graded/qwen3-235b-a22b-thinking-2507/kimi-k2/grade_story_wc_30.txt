<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (cartographer/mechanic selves) act simultaneously in scene; closure choice to transfer wonder into lotus earns endurance with felt cost ("anchors against the drift"). Slight abstraction in motivation ("preserve wonder") lacks concrete prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: beads become "anchors against the drift" during identity shift. Accumulative lens holds—each smelted story tightens the nacre-layering metaphor. Final image reconfigures options through moonlit pearl's weight ("exactly enough").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal atrium constrains every choice: rising water forces urgency, moon phases dictate identity shifts. Beads charge closure—chest-warmth fluctuation crystallizes the final image. Micro-setting (creel/furnace) alters tactics during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via moon's zenith forcing faster work ("water lapped at her ankles"), narrowing options to preserve wonder. Cost is visceral: identity "migrating" until beads layer "like nacre." Agency lies in her choice to smelt, not circumstance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: contradictions smelted into beads reweight premise. Final pearl offers non-literal answer—"sound of every story"—without moralizing. "Preserving wonder in routine meant carrying the furnace within" avoids abstraction through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass joints clicked like struck bells," "salt and molten memory") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control intensifies during tide rise ("She worked faster now"). No POV slippage; lyrical compression taught early ("hour after tomorrow disappeared").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "sublimate into silver vapor" risks overwriting but earns payoff in "bead no larger than a tear." Final cut-off ("fed by contradictions she") is intentional ellipsis. Slight synonym churn ("rustled"/"trapped") in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "preserving wonder" trope through specific mechanics: smelting stories into contradictory beads. Emotional truth in "child who feared cold/adult who craved it" avoids abstraction. Tide/moon physics constrain choices organically, not gimmickry.</comment>
