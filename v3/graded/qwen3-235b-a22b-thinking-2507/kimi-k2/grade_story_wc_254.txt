<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction ("fear, then name, then edges of shadow") but single-POV constraint limits relationship dynamics; micro-choices under pressure (paraphrasing ban) earn closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with "echo is already home" crystallizing symmetry cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through dissolving boundaries to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade constrains every choice (hand-warming, ink bleeding) and charges final image; "frozen lake that was no longer frozen" reweights setting with undeniable physical cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "symmetry" revelation; single tightening ("melt from bottom") driven by poet's agency with felt cost (crystallized tears, shadow dissolution) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirror logic ("refusal to flip") without moralizing; final constellations-in-silhouette image reweights borders as lived experience, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tasting of iron and snow") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in "seams of cold peeling back like pages" teaches pattern early for payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "aesthetically driven" repetitions (3x) slightly dulls high-pressure beats; otherwise immaculate propulsion ("water held her weight, surface flexing like a drum").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "borders as weather" transforms political trope through embodied physics; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring conceptual cost.</comment>
