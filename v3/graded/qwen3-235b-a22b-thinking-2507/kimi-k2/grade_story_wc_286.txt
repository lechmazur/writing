<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in timeline choices; embodied emotion via thrum vibration; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "resistance to change" insight prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost (thrum vibrating bones); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned density; persistent price (attention's physical toll) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned hives and lantern constrain every choice; micro-setting (sun patterns) directly charges closure image; sensory hierarchy reflects potter's tactile focus. Final bees reprise reweights prior char.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kiran's agency in weighting timelines; visible cost in physical vibration; "phototropic" trait creates unavoidable trade-off between blooming/char. Escalation driven solely by attention choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (cracked glass, sun patterns); final image reweights resistance as "continuous turning" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite philosophical premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (potter's glaze/wax metaphors); rhythmic control in fracture scene; taught compression ("splitting dusk into two evenings") pays off in closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("thrums answered, guiding deeper"). "Wax ghosts" slightly risks overwriting but remains voice-motivated; closure beat pristine. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and mindfulness; specific sun-pattern navigation avoids derivative time-travel tropes. Risk-taking (non-causal structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
