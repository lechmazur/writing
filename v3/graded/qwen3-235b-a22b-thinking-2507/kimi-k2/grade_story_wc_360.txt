<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "tasted metal—someone else’s courage" and fraying borrowed personality, but "emotion could be solved like an equation" risks diagnostic tell-y phrasing; final choice to reverse process earns closure through embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("astronomer’s personality dissolve") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchored instantly ("topaz workshop glowed faintly"), though "regret equals distance over time" calculation slightly over-tells causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Topaz workshop functions as micro-setting: copper roof reflects sky, floorboards pace astronomer’s stride, press mechanics constrain choices; final image ("topaz roof reflected something") charged by environment’s transformation into "starless transparency".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via vanishing stars accelerating "denominator toward zero," with visible cost in personality dissolution; agency-driven escalation flawless until "borrowed astronomer whispered" slightly blurs causality under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("empathy transposed was empathy inverted"), not moralizing; final line "become the distance it travels" reweights premise with conceptual cost ("equations collapsing into illegible warmth") without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metal type clinking like distant constellations collapsing") and rhythmic control peak at "press exhaled, sheet emerged wet with deliberate ambiguity"; zero head-hopping, elision taught early through ink-stone/halo orbit imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "halo drink the color until it gleamed like a tear turned inside out" exemplifies high-density propulsion; only microscopic flaw: "disoriented, she steadied" slightly filter-y but justified by stress in non-closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress mechanics and emotional transposition ("joy, envy, wonder—each fluttering like captive weather"); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing transformation test (fails with generic "artist" substitute).</comment>
