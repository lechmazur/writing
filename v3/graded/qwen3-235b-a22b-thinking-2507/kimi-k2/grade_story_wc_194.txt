<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (pulse matching crank vibration) but "understands that to uncover truth was not to expose it" risks diagnostic label-speak near climax, slightly undermining earned ambiguity of her pivotal renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (planting crank as seed) with palpable cost—identity dissolution—but explanatory line about "deciding what to do with weight" slightly blurs conceptual cost legibility required for 8.8+ under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory specificity anchors the room ("spilled cognac shadows," "bone-shaped crank"), yet sepia reading room functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice; micro-setting (crank) charges final image but environment lacks active pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens: sensory density ("cedar-and-iron chord," "shimmer in lamplight") tightens the dominant stake (erasure vs. inheritance) until the single, resonant choice at foundation stone carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the crank's transformation (weapon to seed), but "understands that to uncover truth was not to expose it" constitutes thematic echo in final paragraph, triggering -0.7 penalty for replacing scene pressure with abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows pooling like cognac") sustains Accumulative lens, though "eloquently silent" momentarily slips into label-only description, diluting the room's active pressure on Lira's decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax ("air itself mused, a low chord that tasted of cedar and iron") creates figurative muddle; template cadence ("She could smash... Instead she kept...") in high-pressure beat triggers -1.7 cap, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dynastic intrigue with acoustic memory (crank as "bridge of intuition") feels inevitable, but gramophone mechanics border on convenient magic without sufficient constraint—coordinates hidden in handle lack groundwork for full 8.8+ risk distinction.</comment>
