<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her trembling hands versus steadfast singing, embodying the cost of pruned lives; embodied emotion ("throat held only the taste of salt and starlight") avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: limited depth in micro-choices under pressure beyond alignment and singing, slightly thinning the endurance arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: world "exhaling" crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("cities unbuilt, loves unmet"). Accumulative lens holds through nested reflections deepening stakes; cost proof anchors in "pruned so the world might limp one heartbeat longer" before the dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pane of hush constrains every pivotal choice (alignment, singing, dissolution) and charges the final image as her heartbeat; lighthouse descent’s salt-crusted steps and salt roses create micro-setting causality. No generic placeholders—sensory details ("cold as first breath") serve urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pruning lives to save the world) tightens through the mirrors’ cost revelation, narrowing options to singing or silence; agency’s cost ("cities unbuilt") is visceral. Escalation via accumulative density—each reflection deepens the weight—makes the lullaby’s trade-off unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: salt roses with clock-seeds reconfigure "endings as invitations to tenderness" without moralizing. Final image (child laughing across the ripple) offers resonant, non-literal answer to survival’s cost, avoiding thematic echo or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised awe," "hush of time’s final ripple") filters all details through her temporal role; rhythmic cadence modulates under pressure (short phrases during singing). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s bone-and-star chimes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals opening to reveal seeds shaped like tiny clocks" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("fracture now a doorway") remains coherent under pressure—no register drift or mixed metaphors dulling the closure’s dissolving pane.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: doomsday clock mechanics transformed via lullabies and salt roses, avoiding apocalypse tropes. Emotional specificity in "gardener who would plant a rose that outlived stars" creates inevitability; risk-taking (descending lighthouse) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
