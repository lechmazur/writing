<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; resentment flashes as "static" but lacks layered embodiment. Pivotal shift ("she understood then") occurs off-page, weakening causality of release. Micro-choice placing pin on altar shows growth but internal struggle remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flawless Accumulative/Textural closure: Charged Poise crystallizes cost in "final breath a note" with visible lifetime sacrifice. Orientation established instantly; lens holds through lyrical refrains. Minor escalation dip as battlefield transformation leans coincidental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sanctuary walls as "velvet lungs" constrain choice and charge final image. Sensory hierarchy masterful: "cooled ash" stone, warmth-as-melody. Body/tool (pin) reweights closure when Lira's breath becomes stored sound. Micro-setting essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (silencing anthems/resentment) signaled early but resolution lacks earned escalation. Battlefield shift to garden feels coincidental rather than Lira's agency; resentment release lacks visible struggle. Cost (lifetime in sanctuary) legible but disconnected from core conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: pin as "wound that taught the knife to rust," tears "falling like seeds." Final image reweights pacifism as silencing echoes in hearts, not drums. Avoids moralizing; complexity in "scheming pacifist" duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "velvet lungs," "ribbons of color" reflect Lira's synesthetic focus. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("palms on stone that felt like cooled ash"). No head-hopping; elision taught early via "while reality shifted" refrains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" functions as vague pseudo-science in high-pressure beats, reducing clarity. Minor scaffold in "invoking shifting grace, the art of..." but no closure artifacts. Lyrical density excels; "static" resentment metaphor tells rather than shows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism via metal memory and soundless sanctuary. Transforms "scheming pacifist" trope through cellular stakes. Battlefield-to-garden risks allegory but saved by concrete "poppies" and "morning glories" specificity. Avoids safety middle.</comment>
