<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Lira holds the drowning memory "like a too-hot spoonful" yet chooses to become it; embodied emotion avoids labels via chef-specific sensory language ("tasted the image; it burned like vinegar on a cut").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: salt flowers crystallizing "the splash, the cry, the silence" reconfigure remorse into bearable fragments; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to dissolution moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coral pavilion functions as micro-setting constraining choice (transferring remorse through touch) and charging closure via "warm to the touch" columns; tidal pool analysis evolves causally from diagnostic tool to transformed broth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency—analyzing pool, stirring broth, licking memory—under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral when she becomes the drowning lord, with tactics constrained by coral's brittleness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through culinary alchemy: "sandpaper rough memories" culminates in salt flowers holding "echo of loss rather than its full weight"; final image of singing coral reweights grief without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is chef-centric ("pressed her tongue to the air," "whisk made from helmet plume"); rhythm modulates from staccato ("The flavor was remorse") to flowing descriptions during memory fusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in peak beats ("steam rose... droplets falling like slow applause" does triple duty advancing plot/atmosphere/theme); final line's "sandpaper" reprise crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Culinary grief transformation feels inevitable through specific, grounded choices (tasting remorse as salt); risk-taking heightens stakes via edible memory mechanics without gimmickry.</comment>
