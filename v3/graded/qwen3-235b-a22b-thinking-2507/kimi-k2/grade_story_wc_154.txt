<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lin's embodied guilt ("stomach fold like wet paper") and contradictory impulses—translator vs. sister, coral as burden vs. ritual object—drive choices like decrypting the cast. Flaw: "shrewdly innocent" posture lacks visible cost; it's observed but not tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "the coral print had already begun to fade, but the decrypted message remained scored into her palm" crystallizes irreversible loss and fragile hope with conceptual cost (memory vs. physical artifact). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—sensory density builds to this reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (brain coral) constrains choices: Lin presses it to the cast to "graft new meaning," directly charging the final image where "polyps blooming again" as "small brave words" reweights trauma. Mist and monitors ("distant buoys") mirror internal tides without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via decryption deepens the dominant stake (shared anxieties): smudged numbers reveal "ship/fire/mother/gone," narrowing Lin's focus from passive waiting to active meaning-making. Cost is legible in "the arm will remember the break" and fading coral print—bodily and symbolic permanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral’s transformation: dead lattice becomes "ghost reef," then "small brave words." Final image ("polyps blooming as words") answers the central question of healing without moralizing, reweighting "shared anxieties" as generative rather than destructive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lin’s perceptual signature—translating "gunfire into grammar," reading cast ciphers—creates rhythmic control: "Aligning them like stitches" mirrors her profession. No head-hopping; Dr. Vanna’s dialogue ("lotus-hearted ache") distinctively contrasts Lin’s internal compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stomach fold like wet paper" and "monitors beeped like distant buoys" offer textural specificity without muddle. Final line ("a single lung holding both sorrow and salt") crystallizes theme through concrete rhythm, no abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: coral as translator’s tool reframes trauma as linguistic act. Risk-taking (decrypting child’s cast) heightens stakes—turns anxiety into actionable code—without gimmickry. Fresh inflection: "small brave words growing from cracks" avoids trauma tropes.</comment>
