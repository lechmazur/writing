<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (withholding truth as kindness) with embodied aging ("joints loosening into youth"), but "vanishing was not erasure but translation" veers into diagnostic label-speak during peak revelation, slightly undermining emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the stone's release crystallizes the cost (physical youth as erasure price) when rings vanish into reeds. Orientation is immediate ("floating rock meditation platform at twilight"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the magnetic grotto's pulse constrains choice by aligning her pulse with planetary rotation, directly shaping the delayed revelation tactic. Final image of iron filings as dissolving question mark charges closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (teaching vanishing as presence) tightens through the rings' pattern—each unwinding year narrows options until the stone's release forces the girl's realization. Cost is visceral: protagonist's youth is both lesson and payment, legible in "thirteen years old" heartbeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "I am already gone, and that is how I remain" reweights disappearance as translation, avoiding moralizing. Final image of unnamed constellations charges the conceptual cost of erasure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"sycamore bark" voice, iron-in-blood magnetism—modulating with trance intensity. Zero head-hopping; rhythmic control in "breathed once, twice, three times, each exhale younger" embodies temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ghost ripples arriving before the cause" does triple duty (plot, theme, tension). Slight density risk in "patterns in the rings after the stone was thrown" but payoff justifies it. Final line's "er" truncation teaches the pattern without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backwards aging as pedagogical tool transforms trope: vanishing as "quieter register" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (time-folding trance) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by magnetic grotto's physical logic.</comment>
