<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest concretely: Mara locks seed away yet plants it, "safeguarding" space while fearing trespass. Final renunciation earned through embodied cost—"fear flow out like spent rain"—as she surrenders proprietorship. No therapy-speak; "fierce tenderness for every unsolved lock" crystallizes transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: Mara dissolves her master key, becoming "caretaker" as spaces merge. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via mirror chambers and corpse flower’s growth—culminating in brook’s "new key" reconfiguring her identity. Cost legible in "spaces that would never again be entirely hers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: guards seed’s dreams, flows upward in cavern, and sings closure’s "new key." Corpse flower’s stench ("carrion and thunder") charges final image. Dissolving key alters tactics, meeting 9+ gate by shaping the irreversible surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. surrender of innovation) tightens through seed’s "flow" and guest reactions, forcing Mara’s crystallized choice. Agency clear in planting decision and key dissolution; cost manifests as identity loss ("not proprietor but caretaker"). Escalation driven by accumulation of atmospheric pressure under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: key dissolving reweights "safeguarding innovation" as "letting it escape." Final image—"rooms rearrange themselves each night"—offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; corpse flower’s blueprints show rather than tell the central conflict’s resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "glossy as obsidian," "hush of a possibility." Syntax modulates under pressure—lyrical in dreams ("corridors twisting at right angles"), clipped during eruption ("The guests fled"). "Storm-born silence" motif taught early and paid off in brook’s final song, avoiding head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals peeled back like pages" avoids cliché through precise verbs. Figurative language serves pressure ("heart drumming with storm-born silence"). Final line "emerge changed" crystallizes without overwriting. One borderline abstraction ("fierce tenderness") redeemed by "unsolved locks" specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms escape room trope via biological surrealism: corpse flower as living puzzle engine. Emotional truth in Mara’s fear-to-tenderness shift avoids generic templates. "Bioluminescent spores" edges toward familiar surrealism but grounded by concrete stakes—innovation requiring self-annihilation.</comment>
