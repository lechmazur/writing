<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices: "theoretically rebellious" instinct versus need to "widen perspectives" crystallizes on the roof with embodied cost (soaked hair, shifted lecture draft). No diagnostic label-speak; emotions anchored in physicality ("throat tightened," "laugh like wet leaves").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: rain-soaked epiphany reconfigures "house always wins" into "love letter to possibility." Accumulative lens holds through scrawl pattern; cost proof clear in "rain soaking her hair" as physical/emotional price. Minor tension dip mid-traversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Rainwashed library functions as active constraint: tilted windows enable scrawls, puddles reflect "green aquariums," and crucially, the mica pane’s interaction with rain charges the closure ("droplets gathered, refracted... glowed"). Micro-setting (lantern) shapes every key choice from study table to roof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling grief with father’s philosophy) tightens through Mara’s agency: photographing scrawls, traversing aisles, roof climb. Escalation under Accumulative lens reweights "house edge" into "love disguised as time" with visible cost on the page (emotional vulnerability amid rain). Mid-beat pressure slightly soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "house edge is love disguised as time" evolves into closure’s "love letter to possibility" without moralizing. Final image reweights gambling metaphors into earned resonance—no thematic echo, just phosphorescent lantern light teaching fire through rain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature masterfully blends academic precision ("probability professor") and poetic compression ("puddles reflected stacks like green aquariums"). Rhythm modulates under pressure: short staccato for scrawl discoveries, lyrical flow on roof. Zero head-hopping; elision of backstory taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning: "rain drumming the skylight like restless chips" advances setting, emotion, and theme. Only hairline flaw: "theoretically rebellious" slightly over-explained, but no closure impact. Final line’s "deck shuffled into something she could hold" crystallizes without cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms gambling tropes through specific, grounded details: cracked mica pane (not generic heirloom), subway seats repurposed as benches. Emotional truth in "house always wins because the house is time" avoids derivative pitfalls. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
