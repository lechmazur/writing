<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in net-mending craft ("knots retied in darkness"), micro-choices like wetting thumb to test whisk grain. "Scintillatingly somber" borders abstraction but redeemed by embodied cost in generational handoff. Guard's softened face reveals relationship pressure without dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: fireflies spelling "mend" crystallizes care's geometry with felt cost (passing wisdom to boy). Orientation clear by 60 words. Accumulative escalation via firefly interactions deepens stakes but lacks one decisive pressure intensification near climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bamboo whisk as micro-setting constrains choices (tilted for firefly landing) and charges final image spelling "mend". Rain-slick parapet enables moon-path reflections; firefly pulses mirror net repairs. Sensory details filtered through mender's tactile expertise ("stones exhaling cool mist").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring hidden effort against decay) signaled early via mother's dolphin whistle. Deepening occurs as fireflies map care's "secret geometry," but pressure lacks one tangible narrowing of options—decay remains abstract antagonist without concrete tactical consequence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through net/whisk/firefly parallels: "knots a syllable in the world's sentence." Final image of "mend" spelled in light reweights maintenance as cosmic prayer without moralizing. Boy's smile embodies "conspiracy of care" as earned resonance, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fingers knew the sea better than any sailor," moonlight on "new twine" revealing mended nets. Rhythmic control under pressure ("whistle threading damp air like silver wire"). "Scintillatingly somber" slightly ornate but voice-coherent for philosopher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "hollow handle like a signal from the other side of patience" shows high density. Minor overwriting risk in "scintillatingly somber truth" (two adjacent abstract phrases), but cadence breathes with scene needs. Final line’s "sleeping dragons remembering flight" crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms maintenance trope through net-mender cosmology: fireflies as "galaxies in abdomen," knots as "world's sentence." Risk-taking (philosopher as castle climber) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals—dolphin whistle, bamboo whisk grain—making "conspiracy of care" inevitable.</comment>
