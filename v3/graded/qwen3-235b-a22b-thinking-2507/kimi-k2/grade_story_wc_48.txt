<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("beauty to avoid truth") and embodied emotion (boots in ink-smelling mud) drive choices, but "conflicted novelist" archetype borders on stock despite strong micro-choices like naming release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: releasing names with visible cost (shell smoothing), but "dawn pressing against blinds" slightly softens the felt cost of her artistic rebirth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: printer's ink mud constrains movement while the seashell's evolving role (anxiety object → recording device → baptismal token) directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through cameo encounters, but pressure lacks visceral tightening; "hope as absence" revelation is profound yet insufficiently tests her commitment with escalating cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through salt-water smear and smoothed shell, avoiding moralizing, but final notebook opening leans toward hopeful symmetry rather than earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist tasting her doubt") with rhythmic control; "lucidly watchful" repetition becomes character-specific refrain rather than tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose soars with "printer’s ink and regret" specificity, but "lucidly watchful" synonym loops in high-pressure beats trigger minor momentum drag (-0.4).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writer’s block as spectral tribunal feels inevitable, though "feral nexus" setting risks over-familiarity without the ink-smelling mud’s gritty transformation.</comment>
