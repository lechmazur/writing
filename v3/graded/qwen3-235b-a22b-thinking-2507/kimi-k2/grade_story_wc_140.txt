<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied contradictions: "lungs bargaining with air" and pockets holding poison-label reality shifts show struggle without therapy-speak. Final renunciation as "space between stories" earns cost via dissolving certificate, though micro-choices lack sufficient friction in high-tide climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with certificate dissolving into salt and narrator becoming "space between stories"—cost legible in identity's erasure. Orientation anchored by "drowned at 03:17" within 20 words; Accumulative lens holds through jar-arrangement cadence shift, though label's warmth slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choice: salt wind scouring metal enables the pivotal label-pressing moment, while rusted doors slamming with the moon's pulse charge the final swaying chorus. Micro-setting (poison label's adhesive) directly alters perception to enable memory corridors, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"prove I am more than an administrative typo"—tightens through the narrator's agency in sorting jars into name-spelling chords, with cost crystallizing as identity dissolves. Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds, though tide's role in chorus feels slightly coincidental versus earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: erased histories hum in "emptiness" and rise as "wet and gleaming" horizons without moralizing. Final image reweights the labyrinth as "what the world chose to forget," offering resonant non-literal answer to survival's meaning, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sepia" reality tint and containers as "corridors of memory" filter all observation. Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented clauses ("I listen.") to lyrical density during jar arrangement, with purposeful compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "tide rises rinsing minutes off me like loose paint." Semicolon in "I press it against the steel wall; ink spreads..." slightly disrupts climax rhythm, and "sliver of sound" risks abstraction though saved by concrete examples.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms shipping containers from industrial backdrop into memory vessels with fresh inflection: erased histories "pool" as humming emptiness in crane lifts. Bold risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing death-certificate trope through bitter-almond reality shifts.</comment>
