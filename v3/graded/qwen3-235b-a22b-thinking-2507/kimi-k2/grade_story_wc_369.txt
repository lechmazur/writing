<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied motivation (“discover what trees witness”) drives action, but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices reveal values yet flaw integration remains superficial without complicating stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the transformed sextant’s oak-leaf shadow reconfigures grief with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts to healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tower and oak roots constrain choice (shards placed where moonlight reaches), charging the final image; “spilled mercury” moonlight and moss spirals avoid cliché through precise, character-filtered observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (“discover what trees witness”) remain abstract without concrete opposition; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or trade-off beyond internal contemplation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sextant cracks and tree rings, culminating in the resonant final image: healing as golden seams reweights “quantified sorrow” without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“damp prints,” “bruise-like sextant”) sustains under pressure; rhythmic control falters slightly in “conceptual repricing” phrasing during high-stakes repair.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; “3.7 centimeters of grief” exemplifies high-density specificity; only minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration” amid otherwise flawless propulsion during deconstruction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy and grief via measurable cracks avoids tropes, but moonlight healing lacks bold risk; emotional truth anchors universality without generic abstraction.</comment>
