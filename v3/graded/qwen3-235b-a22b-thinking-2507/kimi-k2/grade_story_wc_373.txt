<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Lila sees her father's photo and chooses filial loyalty over the mission, embodied in the recorder destruction. Slight abstraction in "comforting unease" prevents 9.0, but micro-choices (thumb hovering over stop switch) reveal authentic conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis with undeniable cost: Lila forecloses her path by breaking the recorder, leaving the fob as a "promise that some sil[ence]"—the uncertain outcome charging the final image. Accumulative lens holds through patterned false starts deepening pressure until the fiddler finishes the tune.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pirate market micro-setting constrains every choice: near-noises test the truce, molasses barrels contextualize stakes. The watch fob (warm gold, ticking) evolves from mission tool to broken promise, charging the ending. Only "comforting unease" slightly abstracts the physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: fiddler's false starts and near-noises deepen pressure until Roe's photo forces Lila's agency. Dominant stake (father's freedom) tightens visibly at "thirty minutes until sunrise," with cost legible in the snapped reel and uncertain outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "trust breaks with a sound lighter than breath" becomes the fiddler's finished tune and Lila's choice. Final image reweights trust as "a promise that some sil[ence]"—no moralizing, just resonant cost in the broken fob left behind.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lila notices tactile/sound details (splintered planks, fob's warmth). Rhythm modulates perfectly—longer phrases for tension, staccato for climax ("rewound... erased... snapped"). "Comforting unease" slightly generic but redeemed by physical anchors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "lanterns swinging from rusted hooks, their glow the color of bruised peaches" does triple duty. Final image's truncated "sil[ence]" avoids muddle. Microscopic flaw: "comforting unease" lacks concrete anchor but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms pirate tropes through specific, grounded choices: fishhook braids, molasses moonshine with laughing skulls. Emotional truth in the daughter's impossible choice feels fresh; the "truce of hush" concept is brilliantly executed with no derivative echoes.</comment>
