<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("why echo") and micro-choices like shaping notes into questions, but internal conflict lacks layered irrationality beyond binary choice; "richly perceptive" trait shown through tasting "iron of old betrayals" yet contradictory impulses under pressure remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: stranger dissolving into sound while singer chooses eternal resonance, crystallizing stakes through "memory refuses to be still." Accumulative lens holds perfectly as echo density tightens toward crystallization, though "progressive disclosure" method isn't dramatized as active mechanic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus actively constrains movement ("boots crunching fossilized riverbeds") and charges closure as shell fuses with rock; whispering seashell functions as indispensable micro-setting evolving from tool to "earth's new mouth," making environment inseparable from final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening cosmic revelation ("hearts resonate at dying stars' frequency") rather than causal turns, with singer's agency decisive in rejecting silence for sorrow's beauty; cost is visceral in stranger's dissolution and "ribs vibrate" physicality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "stars remember us" final line reweighting prior material without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by grounding cosmic grief in bodily specifics ("hollows where mother's laughter lived"), with reed-blown melancholy evolving from sorrow to sacred resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste iron of old betrayals," "starlight dripped like molten glass") and rhythmic control mirror canyon spirals, though "progressive disclosure" jargon slightly clashes with lyrical voice during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines like "melancholy sliding down canyon walls like water seeking its own level" achieve triple duty (image/sound/theme) with crystalline propulsion. Minor deduction for "webs of intrigue" generic phrasing redeemed by cosmic context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "echo" trope through scientific-poetic lens (grief as cosmic antenna), with fresh inflection in sorrow's beauty being essential; seashell fusion with stone demonstrates indispensable specificity that would break closure if removed.</comment>
