<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grim optimist" who walks to prove existence while seeking escape; embodied emotion in "texture of missed opportunity grind against my skin" avoids labels. Secondary character limited to visions weakens relationship crucible despite poignant dice exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "suspended between perpetual motion of memory and stillness of acceptance" with conceptual cost in "limit of regret as time approaches infinity is the texture." Accumulative lens holds—equations reweight staircase pressure—but cost could feel more visceral at rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Staircase functions as micro-setting: steps rearrange into "slope of her shoulder," marble cracks under equations, and final risers inscribed with proof. Dice constrain choices repeatedly, charging closure where "staircase dissolved into the texture of her fingertips."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity texture) tightens when equations spill across risers, narrowing options to mathematical proof. Cost legible in "steps sliding like pistons to close the gap," though escalation leans slightly heavy on accumulation over protagonist agency in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete math metaphors: "regret is the integral of velocity over a closed loop" becomes earned wisdom without moralizing. Final line reweights premise as "every step was both ascent and descent," avoiding thematic echo while crystallizing emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "air tasted of chalk and iron, as though steps exhaled dust of erased proofs." Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from fragmented climbs to flowing equations, with no head-hopping despite temporal fluidity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "marble cracked along the chalked line, a hairline fissure that exhaled warm air smelling of her perfume" achieves high density. Final line crystallizes theme without figurative muddle, though "balancedly daring" slightly strains register in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms staircase trope through mathematical lens: dice chip enables specific closure ("rough where the chip had been"), avoiding derivative premises. Emotional truth in "texture of the moment just before dice settle" feels fresh, though infinite staircase concept lacks radical novelty.</comment>
