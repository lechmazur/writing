<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "scour away resentment" vs physical acceptance of guilt; micro-choices like whispering "fraction of weight" reveal hierarchy of values. Slightly over-tidy emotional resolution in final step lowers band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with inscription-by-inscription deepening; closure as Charged Poise (bob's shift altering balance) lands with conceptual cost. Final truncated line "Elara listened to—" weakens cost legibility despite obsidian's echo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal obsidian ridge constrains every choice (kneeling on runes, salt stinging eyes) and charges closure via sound absorption; "feather-light" rake handle directly alters the pendulum's mechanics. Micro-setting as essential pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through inscription sequence with visible cost (resentment "scoured away"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—mayor's confession feels revealed rather than earned through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through inscriptions' physical weight loss, not abstraction; final chime/echo reweights "shared balance" as conceptual cost without moralizing. Mayor's confession risks near-thematic echo but avoids articulation of thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fingertip worn smooth from winding" and sea-smoke imagery; rhythmic control peaks in "Click by click" winding sequence. Slight register drift in "ethically diligent" label lowers 9-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</comment><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("bob hanging weightless between past and future"); "feather-light" handle avoids purple prose by charging closure. Final truncated line creates momentum drag in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock mechanics and communal guilt through inscribed objects; "obsidian drinking sound" transforms familiar redemption trope. Safety middle avoided via irreversible emotional cost in "scoured away" resentment.</comment>
