<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied contradiction ("cold, joyful sorrow," soundless laugh shaking shoulders) but "quietly charismatic" remains label without action demonstration; micro-choices like stepping into water earn closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "shoes squelching Morse code" and fading footprints crystallize the renunciation; accumulative lens holds through ritual intensification to the final harbor "exhale."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Harbor water constrains choice (submerging) and charges final image; vintage camera's empty chamber resonates as "dark drum," transforming tool into emotional conduit that reweights silence at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's escalating ritual (signing faster, submerging) under accumulative lens; cost is visceral in water-filled shoes and dissolving footprints, narrowing options to irreversible departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sorrow had distilled it, the way moonlight distills water to silver" avoids moralizing; final image reweights silence as legacy ("hum his tune without knowing why") without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("timpani of memory," "staves of music") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "wrists flicking like swallows" teaches and pays off the accumulative pattern without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "bubbles rising in dotted half notes" exemplifies high-density lyricism. Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly charismatic" appears twice identically, deducting 0.3 but avoiding closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sign language as musical notation transforms deafness into fresh synthesis; "mapping silence" premise gains inevitability through concrete execution (tide as timpani, footprints as Morse code), avoiding derivative tropes.</comment>
