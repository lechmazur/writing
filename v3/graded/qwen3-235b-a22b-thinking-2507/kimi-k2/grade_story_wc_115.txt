<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s religious skepticism versus Saint Jude medal, with micro-choices (rotating the wheel) revealing her truth-seeking hierarchy. Jonah’s off-page presence limits relationship pressure, slightly diluting the crucible effect at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: numerals shifting from 137g to 21g reweights "swallowed truth" with visceral cost ("dense as lead, hot as grief"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through the scanner’s waveform mapping, with cost legible in Mara’s physical release and altered skepticism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (rotation mechanics) and charging the final image ("ballast"). Sensory details like "coal-blackened gravel" and "machine oil" filter through Mara’s explorer lens, directly shaping tactics during the scanner overlay sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency-driven wheel rotations (137g → 21g), narrowing options with escalating conceptual cost. The dominant stake (measuring truth’s weight) gains visceral heft early, though Jonah’s off-page voice slightly softens the felt immediacy of the brotherly conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the beaded wheel’s evolving numerals, culminating in the final line’s non-literal answer: "truth shifts ghostlike until someone turns the wheel." No moralizing—only earned resonance through the Saint Jude medal’s transformation into "ballast."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "headlamp slicing a cone through drowsy alertness," with syntax tightening under pressure ("She rotated the wheel one notch; the tunnel answered"). Slight register drift in "religious skepticism" description barely dents rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("beads rattled softly, as if whispering decimals of sorrow"). Figurative language serves purpose without muddle—rosary-like bead clacking during the climax heightens pressure while preserving clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "truth as measurable weight" transforms familiar tropes through explorer-specific logic. The 21g soul-weight reveal feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightening stakes without obscuring emotional truth.</comment>
