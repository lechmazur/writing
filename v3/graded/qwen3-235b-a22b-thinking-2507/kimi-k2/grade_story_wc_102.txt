<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fearing love's finitude vs seeking healing) drive choices, but "spiritually curious" label lacks embodied tradeoffs; epiphany risks abstraction though grounded in breath mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with visceral cost ("hollow beneath ribs where grief had calcified" becoming "living gold"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly through breath-jasmine resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Jasmine functions as micro-setting constraining choices (petals dilating with breath), directly charging the final image ("jasmine’s pulse beneath"); river underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mei-Ling’s agency (breathing across tear), reweighting "unused love" with felt cost; single deepening suffices for Accumulative escalation at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (cracked bowl → living gold), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "unused love" as active warmth without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("inverted city flared with faces she’d never lived"); rhythmic compression during mending heat heightens pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "fragrance thick as regret" borders cliché; final cut-off ("scenting the...") intentional lyric fade, not artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms past-life trope through camera obscura mechanics; "unused love as calcified grief" offers fresh emotional specificity beyond spiritual cliché.</comment>
