<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in Lysandra’s mechanical arm "translating thought into thrust" versus envoy’s diplomatic precision; micro-choices like stepping on coded stones reveal value hierarchies. Slight interiority thinness in envoy limits secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "destinations are questions grown tired of asking" crystallizes stakes through the brook’s reflection. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks when flipping the needle card reveals the overture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial constrains every choice—aligning needles to facets dictates direction—and charges closure when breeze shifts it to "depart together." Brook’s reflection projecting constellations onto palms makes micro-setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lysandra’s agency: shifting needle IX to "listen" forces envoy’s concession, then flipping the card reveals the overture, crystallizing their stance. Conceptual cost ("questions grown tired of asking") is unmistakable in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: the sundial’s "unfinished angles holding more truth" reframes the central question without moralizing. Final line ("turning every ripple into a destination") reweights "destinations" with earned ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—Lysandra notices "brass knuckles clicking like typewriter keys" and coded angles—while dialogue subtext ("answers like concealed blades") advances conflict. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure during fencing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels action or atmosphere. "Ripostes glinting like shards of fractured light" merges setting, conflict, and motif without muddle. Final image’s "ripples into destinations" avoids cliché through concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms dueling trope via needle cryptography and fencing-as-dialogue. The mechanical arm’s "fluid brutality" and sundial’s coded angles synthesize into fresh emotional logic, with risk-taking (overture as hidden staff) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
