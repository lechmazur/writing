<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silent protagonist limits contradictory impulses but micro-choices like shutter weaving reveal hierarchy of values. 'Stillwater tension' embodies emotion effectively. Absence of secondary character prevents relationship crucible application. Interiority remains concrete through tool-focused action rather than diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: darkness recognizing the child's smile reconfigures the central conflict. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through shutter-weaving escalation. Final pearl image crystallizes stakes with visible physical cost in 'joints creaking like old ropes'. No orientation debt; lens taught by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cobalt dock and dental mirror function as micro-setting that constrains every choice—from shutter color matching to light-reflection mechanics. Final image 'weaving light into the canal' directly charges closure through prior particulars. Sensory details like 'river mist' and 'fogged breath' reflect urgency without checklist fatigue. Meets 9+ gate via tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: weaving shutters actively tightens the vortex rather than coincidence. Dominant stake ('teach darkness stars' value') deepens through conceptual cost when darkness learns the child's smile. Moral calculus sharpens the pearl moment—sacrificing silence for connection. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through 'darkness only devours what it does not recognize as kin' reweighted by the child's appearance. Final image avoids moralizing while answering the central question through charged specifics. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in 'darkness learned' without false equivalence. Resonance stems from bicycle rusting beneath dock.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in 'collects echoes the way others collect stamps' and tool-focused noticing. Rhythmic control peaks in closure beat with fragmented syntax matching physical strain. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early through 'half-spoken secret'. Voice modulates perfectly from 'violet dusk' to 'first star of morning'.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'spiralingly calm' exemplifies purposeful neologism within voice. Every line advances atmosphere or plot—'spokes catching stray glints like tiny galaxies' charges closure. Final line achieves textural specificity without overwriting. Propulsion peaks in vortex tightening sequence with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms 'guardian' trope through dental mirror mechanics and stillwater tension. Fresh synthesis of silence as active empathy makes the cobalt dock indispensable. Risk-taking in conceptual closure ('stars learned the sound of a mother’s cracked voice') heightens stakes without gimmickry. Authentic vision coheres through recurring light motifs.</comment>
