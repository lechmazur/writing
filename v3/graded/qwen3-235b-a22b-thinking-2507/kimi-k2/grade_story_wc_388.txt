<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scoffing debunker vs truth-seeker) crystallize in the paper compass fold; final renunciation of explosive truth earns cost through embodied micro-choices like weighing the stone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: planting the apple reconfigures truth’s cost into generative silence, with "empty pockets yet carrying sharper gaze" making conceptual price undeniable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint—radioactive dust limits time, quartz stillpoint enables document reassembly; final image of wasteland "quietly compassed itself" charges closure through setting’s agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (truth vs peace) tightens through document reassembly; Lina’s agency in folding the compass crystallizes the trade-off with visceral cost: "broadcasting proof would tear fragile peace" made legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (folding letters into compass, planting apple), not statement; final image of orchard harvesting memory reweights "bitter fruit" as non-literal answer to truth’s cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("wind hissed smelling of iodine," "papers scattered like spoor") stays consistent under pressure; rhythmic compression during document reassembly ("a curve that wants another curve") teaches pattern paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "feathery strips" to "paper compass" evolution shows high-density propulsion; final line’s "silence no Geiger could measure" avoids figurative muddle while recharging motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific synthesis (Diamond Apple as memory vessel, shredded letters as evidence); "paper compass" device feels inevitable in hindsight while heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
