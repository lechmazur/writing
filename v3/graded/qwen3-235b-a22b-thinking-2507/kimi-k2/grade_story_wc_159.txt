<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (sap application, cradling laughter) but micro-choices lack contradictory impulses; the final name-stirring moment feels earned yet underdeveloped in conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the unspoken name’s weight crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost, and the Accumulative/Textural lens (resonance density) holds through the library’s exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Opal library and bamboo tube constrain choices (climbing cloudglass, sap selection) and charge the final image; "foxglove regret" motif evolves from sensory detail to thematic heartbeat without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency (repair attempt → phonograph quest) with visceral cost (name unraveling), but the tightening lacks a visible tactical trade-off beyond the sap failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bamboo tube’s repair—laughter as preservative reweights "extinct feelings" without moralizing; final image answers the central question through charged silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of foxglove regret," "breath on the nape") modulates under pressure; no head-hopping, though rhythmic control slightly falters during the phonograph scene’s static description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "velvet moss cushion" edges toward decorative detail; near-miss figurative muddle in "dawn seen through eyelids" doesn’t obscure closure’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "extinct feelings" via orchids/chimes feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "opal library" echoes familiar fantasy tropes.</comment>
