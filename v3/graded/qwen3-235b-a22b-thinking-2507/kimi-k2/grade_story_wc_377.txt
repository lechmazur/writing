<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (mute seeking sound) but micro-choices under pressure lack depth; "seasonally mute" trait remains label without tactical cost beyond silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the pulsing tear in sealskin crystallizes cost of preserving wonder with undeniable conceptual weight ("proof that wonder had agreed to stay").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bluff setting creates atmosphere but fails 9+ gate; iceberg fragment (micro-setting) constrains the sculpture's function yet doesn't alter tactics beyond its thematic role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens as color streams outward, but protagonist's agency is observational—pressure builds via environment, not character-driven choices narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of the tear pulsing like "a second heart" reweights wonder’s fragility without moralizing; theme emerges through concrete actions (sculpture shedding droplets) not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ears wide as moonlit harbors") but "symphonies of truth" phrasing briefly drifts into thematic echo, slightly disrupting voice consistency in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, though "liquid prisms" risks overwriting; final beat ("tuned to a new internal resonance") maintains propulsion without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of sound/color physics feels inevitable; risk-taking (mute protagonist preserving wonder through vibration) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
