<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interiority shines through embodied contradictions (scientific rigor vs emotional vulnerability), but the scarf memory flashback lacks sufficient present-micro-choice integration to fully earn its cost. Micro-choices like hand grounding during prism communion reveal authentic hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "frost reforming in slow spirals of acceptance" crystallizes the conceptual cost of relinquished assumptions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as frost patterns reconfigure meaning through causal pressure of the prism's translation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and prism function as micro-setting that constrains choice (communion method) and charges the final image (frost's transformation). Sensory details like "velvet soaked in rain" masterfully filter perception through Elara's mystic lens without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: frost patterns shifting from terror to acceptance reweight Elara's hypothesis with conceptual cost. The prism's forced memory extraction creates authentic tension between her scientific goal and emotional exposure, narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the prism's transformation of "She never knew I loved her" into universal truth about emotional release. Final image ("frost reforming in slow spirals") offers resonant non-literal answer to absorption question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen breath," "fractal scripts") creates rhythmic control where syntax mirrors emotional shifts. Purposeful compression ("truthful lies woven into every note") taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "droplets climbing back into vapor" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "melody, soft as moth wings" avoids penalty due to patterned lyric payoff in closure image. Final line recharges "quartz arbor" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mystical tropes through specific scientific framing ("measurable truth," "fractal scripts"). Emotional specificity in "tear-streaked, mouth open in a scream that made no sound" avoids generic templates while risk-taking (objects as emotional archives) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
