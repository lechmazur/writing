<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through micro-choices: playing until bleeding fingers to voice "I miss believing" crystallizes the joy/sorrow dichotomy without labels. The seashell's copper heart revelation forces stance crystallization with felt cost in the mother's dual legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "carrying the ephemeral compass in her chest" reconfigures truth/myth convergence while the shell's dust becomes "pigment for her next myth." The Accumulative lens holds as density peaks when heartbeat syncs with copper wire.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The seashell constrains every choice—glowing to crack to crumble—and charges the final image as galaxy-shaped dust. Observatory details (rusted dome, peeling star charts) actively pressure the ritual, not backdrop: dome rotation aligns with epiphany while platform holds the cello.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: each hum reimagining conversations tightens the universal riddle until the shell's copper heart forces the realization about "who controlled the story." Cost is unmistakable in "fingers bled" and the shattered comfort of "I miss believing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the seashell's transformation: "memory was the ephemeral compass" crystallizes the non-literal answer to why humans need lies. Final dust-as-pigment image rejects tidy morals, embracing complexity without sentimentality or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision ("resonant hums," "calcium") fused with poetic compression ("gloomy cheerfulness," "whisper of closing pages"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short bursts during climax ("She played harder")—avoids head-hopping while teaching patterned elision early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats avoid overwriting ("shell crumbled to dust, its copper wire unraveling into spiral galaxy"). Information density soars: "maple ribs gleaming like wet bone" conveys texture, emotion, and thematic weight in one visceral image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms the "myth buster" trope through the seashell's mechanical heart—truth preserved as folklore. Emotional specificity ("I miss believing") avoids generic templates, while the observatory's active role creates freshness. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
