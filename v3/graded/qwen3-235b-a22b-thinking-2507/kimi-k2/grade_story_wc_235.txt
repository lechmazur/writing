<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied jealousy ("resented the girl who still believed flight required only will") and micro-choice bleeding thumb to ignite scroll; final renunciation of chronology earned through prior causality with visible cost in burned timeline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("one face, ageless and unafraid") reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (ash-flake words, timeline consumed); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as selves' fragments accumulate pressure toward conceptual repricing of chaos as narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountain cabin actively constrains choices (floorboards softening to cloud enabling flight) and charges closure (fresh bark on shelf), but micro-setting focus on birch bark slightly overshadows environmental pressure beyond atmospheric tilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: blood ignition, shouting at selves, and scroll-burning narrow options toward accepting chaos; cost legible in "heat consumed the timeline" with tangible stakes reweighted through ash-flake hoarded words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (burning scroll reweights "chaos was truest narrative"); final image of writing with ash offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through embodied action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of iron and pine sap," stars humming names) modulates rhythm under pressure; minor slip in "jaded wonder" bordering label-speak redeemed by immediate embodiment ("surprise hurt") in same sentence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cabin floorboards softened into cloud" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline abstraction ("ridiculous" in jealousy flare) barely avoids penalty due to contextual grounding in physical sensation ("hot").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "meeting past selves" trope through specific mechanics (birch scroll as timeline, blood ignition); emotional truth in "wasted wings/never learned to fall" dialogue avoids derivative safety with bold synthesis of chronology and creation.</comment>
