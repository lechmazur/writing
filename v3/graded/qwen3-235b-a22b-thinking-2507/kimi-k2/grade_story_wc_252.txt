<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hiding her strength behind grace because grace was safer," but secondary pressure is absent without another on-page character to crystallize status dynamics under tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost—"island fraying at sunrise" forecloses safety—but escalation lacks one visible price paid mid-scene to tighten pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe actively constrains choice as cathedral nave during dance; scrimshaw’s physical warmth charges the final image as Lira "carries grace like a cutlass."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via live clock (sunrise vanishing), but internal/external conflict interweaving is thin—harbor’s "polite" surrender lacks concrete on-page test beyond Lira’s reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "I’m not cargo" reprise, avoiding moralizing; final image’s "laughter braided with whale song" offers non-literal answer to authenticity vs. surrender.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magical island" trope via dock worker’s occupational grace; "dancing defiance" synthesizes freshness, though "combative tenderness" risks thematic echo without sufficient novelty.</comment>
