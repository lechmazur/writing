<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (control vs. surrender) drives micro-choices; "strand of her own hair" binding shows embodied value hierarchy with visible cost. Near-flawless sensory specificity avoids therapy-speak despite high-stakes moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "it needed story, the living wrapper" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout; tide reversal tightens options meaningfully. Cost proof: "relinquishing control to communal creation" implicit in final realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Treetop village micro-setting constrains choices: swaying bridges dictate seed placement, firefly light dims during bloom. Recurring doodled paper evolves from tool to living soil, charging final image. Meets 9+ gate requirement decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via seven-night ritual deepens "serenity within motion" stake; tide reversal narrows options to communal trust. Cost is visible in Ari's relinquished control during bloom. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens with no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: doodles becoming petals reweights "story as living soil" without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer to central question ("seed needed story") while avoiding thematic echo. Complexity in serenity requiring communal surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: scent-driven POV ("taste every petal") with syntax mirroring focus shifts. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during seed placement, flowing rhythms during doodling. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "swayed like slow pendulums" establishes visual rhythm immediately. High density: "lanterns of fireflies blinked in violet dusk" does triple duty. No figurative muddle—"distilled serenity" remains lexically precise even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms magical seed trope through specific synthesis: doodling-as-journalizing mechanic feels inevitable. Fresh inflection in "living wrapper of communal breath" resolving the rot/rebirth duality. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
