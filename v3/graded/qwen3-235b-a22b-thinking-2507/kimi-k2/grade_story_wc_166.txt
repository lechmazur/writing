<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in exile/connection tension; "spontaneously anchored" concept lacks concrete embodiment during pivotal "Remember" choice, slightly undercutting earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("Remember" sealing exile's transformation); accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to starlight fountains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden actively constrains choices: cracked pool enables memory-folding realization; black roses unfurling at touch directly charges the final "hush that sang" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via moonstone's physical transformation (taste→warmth→dissolution), but "spontaneous anchor" lacks clear escalation trigger before climax, slightly muddying agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Between tide and stone, memory survives the law" emerges organically from runes; avoids moralizing by reweighting ban through "hush that sang" without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bare feet reading dark soil like braille") masterful; minor rhythmic hiccup in "obsidian grace" repetition during high-pressure fledge sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "tidewater writing on sand" metaphor risks overwriting in pivotal fledge beat; final line "hush that sang" achieves crystalline propulsion despite lush density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through "obsidian grace" specificity; cosmic verse concept fresh but "nostalgia ban" premise lacks distinctive world logic to fully escape derivative guardrail.</comment>
