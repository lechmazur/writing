<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority grounds abstract motivation through synesthetic embodiment ("forge’s orange hummed like a distant trumpet"), but brother’s memory revelation edges toward convenient epiphany without sufficient prior causal tension in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("hear not warning but witness"), though Accumulative/Textural lens wavers slightly when the brother’s memory shortcut replaces earned escalation in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: the dividing cells function as a live biological clock dictating the protagonist’s urgency, while the forge’s heat physically imprints absences into slag, charging the final mosaic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("violet said 'forgive,' indigo said 'forget,' but crimson screamed 'flee'"), but the protagonist’s discovery of the "hush" relies more on revelation than active agency-driven escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the mosaic’s transformation: trust breaking as "a hush" rather than a crack reweights the entire premise without moralizing, culminating in the resonant final image of underwater blossoms "like ears finally ready to listen."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in synesthetic compression ("gold tasted like the first time my brother had handed me a seashell"), with rhythmic control tightening during the memory wave ("The memory struck like a rogue wave") without sacrificing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals opening like ears finally ready to listen" achieves high-density resonance. Minor deduction for "cells kept dividing" bordering on transit telling, though redeemed by "seeds splitting like tiny clocks" in the same beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis: the hearing-aid designer’s profession becomes essential to the core metaphor ("shaped silence"), avoiding abstraction via concrete mechanics like slag tiles capturing "the shape of what was missing."</comment>
