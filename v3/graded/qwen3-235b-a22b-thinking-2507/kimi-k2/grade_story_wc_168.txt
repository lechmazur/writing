<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("pain was not a wound but a prism") manifests in simultaneous action (coaxing colors while reliving fire) without diagnostic labels; scarred cheek as text rather than shame crystallizes earned renunciation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("debt now a bridge") lands with conceptual cost in "innocence was not lost but lent," holding Accumulative/Textural lens through density increase in the ritual's color-splitting; celestial indifference reweights grief with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (cracked porcelain box) constrains ritual choices and charges closure: hinge refracting moonlight into "seam stitching past to present" transforms the object from vessel to active metaphor under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening reflection narrows options to the ritual's "moment before," with agency in Mara's micro-choices (kneeling, speaking aloud) reweighting the dominant stake (unpaid debt) into "bridge" under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "words tasted of smoke and iron."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("aurora teaching the night how to hold hard softness") offers resonant answer to central question without moralizing, emerging from concrete particulars (moth dissolving into "forgive") rather than abstract commentary; avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ink faded to old blood," "boots silent on frost-silvered gravel") filters all detail through firefighter's embodied memory; rhythmic control peaks in compressed syntax during fire memory ("the roar, the column of orange that ate the stars").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pain was not a wound but a prism" exemplifies high-density propulsion where metaphor clarifies rather than obscures, with cadence shifts ("She closed her eyes...") matching emotional intensity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transformation of grief through firefighter's occupational specificity ("coaxing seedlings into burned soil" repurposed for auroras) avoids tropes; "hard softness" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, resisting abstraction with verifiable details like soot-powdered moth wings.</comment>
