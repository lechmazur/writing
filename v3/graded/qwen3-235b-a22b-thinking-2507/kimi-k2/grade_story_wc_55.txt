<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elian’s fear of "the world would break it" versus his graphite-redrawn silent mechanism; embodied emotion in "palms open, letting chill enter skin" avoids labels. Slight causality gap in crystal’s whisper initiating action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("lighter by abandoned dream, heavier by reclaimed"); Accumulative lens holds through droplet rearrangement deepening pressure. No causality breaks despite garden’s agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (redrawing without "speaking" escapements) and charges closure via sphere "ticking only when heart skipped"; micro-setting replaces occupational exposition perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when garden warms after Elian’s whispered fear, altering his tactics (omitting sound-producing parts); cost legible in dual weight shift. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "gears of moments fear almost won," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights silence as active reconciliation, not passive retreat. No thematic echo in closing fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in clockmaker’s precision ("interlocking rings mirrored gear train"); rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to sparse under pressure. "Petrichor nostalgia" repetition slightly flattens voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; high density ("excusingly gentle chill enter skin") with varied syntax. Verbatim "petrichor nostalgia" repeat in Q7 creates minor loop, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms artist’s-block trope via crystalline specificity; emotional truth in "measure silence between heartbeats" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (garden as active pressure source) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
