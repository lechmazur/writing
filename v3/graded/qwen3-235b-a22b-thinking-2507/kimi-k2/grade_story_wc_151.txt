<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in chalk symbols (public innocence/private confession); final mailing choice earned by tactile details like "fingertips smudged with chalk" showing cost of vulnerability. No second character limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: walking backward while violinist's note becomes "sound of city waking" crystallizes stakes with felt cost in "chalk smudged with fingerprints." Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation to this crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marble floor constrains choice (chalk requires surface); final image of fractured reflection among symbols charges closure. Micro-setting (chalk dust on hands) directly alters tactics when adding final glyph, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via tactile deepening: hesitation at postbox → adding winged envelope symbol under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "chalk squeaked, a sound like childhood scraped across time" as irreversible vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through surface mail's physicality vs. digital erasure; final "Read the cracks, not the words" reweights margins without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo by embedding insight in action, not declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "holograms of antique penny-farthing bicycles" filtering tech through nostalgia. Rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn description to staccato "chalk squeaked" under pressure, teaching pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sound like childhood scraped across time" achieves high density. Minor overwriting in "heart ticking faster than drones’ rotors" (-0.1) but closure beat ("fractured among chalk symbols") immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms analog/digital tension via sidewalk chalk codes—a fresh synthesis where "carefully inventive" life meets tactile communication. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
