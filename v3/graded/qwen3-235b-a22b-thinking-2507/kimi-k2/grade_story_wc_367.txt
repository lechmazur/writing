<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; Kael's flawless competence undercuts struggle. Final choice (becoming the storm) is earned with visible cost, yet micro-choices like angling the wick don't reveal hierarchical values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: black sun blinking open reconfigures dawn with undeniable cost (lighthouse crumbling, Kael's transformation). Orientation clear by line 3; accumulative lens holds as fracture density tightens pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (glass wick) constrains choices and charges closure—its fracture guides Kael's steering, while the floating shard finale reweights the prophetic vision. Sensory details ("tasting salt and ozone") are purposefully urgent during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency: wick fracture forces millimeter mirror adjustments, narrowing options toward the black sun's alignment. Cost is unmistakable in "sweat and rain indistinguishable" and the lighthouse's sacrificial crumbling during the final ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—laughter as creation tool, shadows as "ink" for rewriting dawn—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("shiver with joy") reweights "world ends quietly" into earned resilience without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Kael's storm-attuned noticing ("constellations pressed like curious fish") modulates rhythm from ritualistic cadence to frantic spins. Zero register drift; compression under stress ("laughed harder, tasting salt") heightens pressure without muddying voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or stakes. "Hairline fracture that forked like prophecy" avoids cliché while "braided light and shadow" crystallizes climax without figurative muddle. Final paragraph’s rhythm accelerates flawlessly into closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through specificity: prophetic wick fracture guides ritual mechanics, black sun as "open pupil" reframes apocalypse. Risk-taking (lyric escalation over causal turns) heightens stakes coherently; the shard’s whispering finale feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
