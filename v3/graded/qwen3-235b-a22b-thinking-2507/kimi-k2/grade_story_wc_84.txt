<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied contradiction ("heartbeat like Morse code she never learned") and micro-choices under pressure (hovering fingers, palm-completion of bracket). Pilgrim remains a symbolic device, slightly weakening relationship-as-crucible despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: pilgrim's absence "as articulate as scripture" and observatory's darkness crystallize the conceptual shift from destination to compass. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through star-trail rhythm redefining belonging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" and matrix chip constrain choices (alignment with meridian, slotting into drone) while charging the final image ("sky’s empty corridors"). Observatory’s gears "dreaming of the next pilgrim" makes setting a living pressure point, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when Lira realizes drone sought "resonance that would make every place home," not coordinates. This reconfiguration forecloses physical destination with visceral cost (pilgrim’s vanishing, observatory’s darkness), though escalation leans slightly thematic in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through diegetic projection ("WE ARE THE MISSING PIECES") transformed by the final open parenthesis glyph—a non-literal answer to "belonging." Avoids moralizing by making cost tangible (pilgrim’s absence) rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots crunching on fallen star-charts") and rhythmic control under pressure ("rotors whispering like turning pages"). Elision (drone’s "dreaming of home") taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("gears gaping like mouths missing teeth" does triple duty). Minor register drift in "frequency of belonging" risks thematic echo but saved by diegetic context. Final line’s "sang in its proper key" avoids cliché through sonic specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes drone tech and pilgrimage into fresh metaphor where "missing pieces" feel inevitable. Risk-taking (star trails as connect-the-dots story) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "brilliant dimness" redefines belonging as rhythm, not light.</comment>
