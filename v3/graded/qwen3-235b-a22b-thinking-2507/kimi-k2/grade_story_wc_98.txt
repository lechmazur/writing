<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's "simple and fierce" motivation slightly told; "luminous doubt" blind spot shown through micro-choices (tasting flat tales, planting depth as lullaby) but internal contradiction needs sharper embodiment during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: monsoon rain striking cheek while sapling roots memories, with "luminous doubt flickering" proving visible cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as forgetting density escalates to dream-pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ridge functions as micro-setting: composted song soil dictates planting depth, monsoon clouds "counting down days" constrain tactics, and final "ridge straightened" charges closure with embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: interpreting orchid dream → summoning witnesses under monsoon pressure; cost crystallizes in "luminous doubt flickering" as she endures with protected-but-fragile memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: biting the fruit floods her with "belonging," not information, and truncated ending ("must be questioned or they oss...") reweights doubt as preservation's necessary cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" voice shines: tasting story pH, moss "humming like sleeping lute," and syntax tightening during dream-pressure ("pages began to curl, edges browning") create unmatched perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "knowledge fruit seed" evolves organically to "luminous fruit," though "luminous doubt" risks abstraction—saved by "flickering at corners of eyes" embodying the cost in final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through visceral mechanics: petals carrying syllables, doubt as active preservation tool; "whale-rise tune" and shadow-weaving witnesses avoid quirky ornament by charging the climax.</comment>
