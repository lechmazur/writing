<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "insomnia was the price of keeping her memory awake," with embodied choices like planting the postcard driving the climax. Minor deduction as sister remains off-page, limiting relationship crucible depth despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly when "armistice settle inside his ribs like a seed," with conceptual cost of transformed grief made undeniable. Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors by line 2 with no disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (broken tip for wind, calcite cracks for planting) and charges the final image as "gargantuan lantern." Recurring postcard evolves from object to vine to dissolved petals, reweighting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten decisively when poet plants the postcard, narrowing options to "root your sorrow." Agency drives escalation through watering with tears, with visible cost in "magnesium and regret" taste. Final reconfiguration of armistice between memory/forgetting crystallizes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "blossom armistice" redefined as memory/forgetting reconciliation in the sister's silent shoreline dream. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through "seed that would not bloom until next longing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "coral-colored minutes" and "wisteria and gunpowder" scent; rhythm modulates perfectly from fragmented lullabies to flowing closure. No head-hopping; "photosynthesized" slightly stretches lexicon but fits transformative theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tears tasted of magnesium and regret" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final fragment "He" pays off taught pattern. Minor deduction as "photosynthesized" borders academic register in peak beat but remains thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through "reef-shadow joy" specificity and shell micro-setting. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without confusion; "blossom armistice" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh. Emotional truth avoids abstraction via tangible star-flowers and kelp parchment.</comment>
