<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied regret via flute's scarred lip plate and wrist sigil burn, but "tending the wound" edges toward diagnostic language risking -0.3. Contradictory impulses (holding tight vs letting go) earn closure through driftwood rearrangement, though emotional progression lacks sufficient irrationality during peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when markers shift into a "gentle wave," reconfiguring guardianship with felt cost ("live in the tear"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: each driftwood marker deepens the stake through density, culminating in the gold leaf's sigil reweighting the core conflict without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range's moaning crack actively constrains choice by triggering her epiphany, while the flute's fracture physically embodies her mistake. Micro-setting functions flawlessly—cedar spindle's vibration charges the closure when the flute resonates, proving environment-as-character. Minor deduction for "basalt" lacking idiosyncratic specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when she turns markers 45 degrees, narrowing options from compass to spiral. The cost is visceral: "wrist sigil burned black" during failure now demands accepting permanent vulnerability ("live in the tear"). Escalation culminates in the flute's fracture widening—a direct consequence of her choice to rearrange, with no coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the driftwood spiral and gold leaf sigil (closed gate/open eye) reweight "weaving vs braiding" without abstraction. Final image of playing a note that "does not open or close" offers resonant non-literal answer to guardianship, avoiding moralizing. "Tending the wound" phrasing risks thematic echo but is redeemed by physical enactment with the leaf.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in noticing "bleached branches angled toward memory of collapse," not mere wood. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short clauses ("She knelt.") amid lyrical density. "Avalanchingly quiet" refrain pays off when canyon hush becomes "shelter," teaching the pattern early without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "folded space like silk" and fracture metaphors maintain physical logic while charging momentum. Sentence rhythm varies from staccato ("She remembered how...") to flowing cadences, accelerating during the spiral rearrangement. Final cutoff "the echo that—" avoids overwriting, with every modifier serving closure's density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian" trope through specific emotional calculus: failure stems from misapplying music ("soothe what steel could not") not villainy. The "weaving vs braiding" insight feels inevitable yet fresh, grounded in flute mechanics and driftwood physics. Risk-taking with open ending pays off through concrete actions, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
