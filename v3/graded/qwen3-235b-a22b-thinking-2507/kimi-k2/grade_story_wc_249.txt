<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority excels via sensory memory embodiment ("tasted of sea salt and violin rosin"), but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; rebellion remains consistent without visible internal tradeoffs during the lagoon climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when memories return to donors ("ripples leapt outward...carrying seed back"), with tangible cost ("fingertips tingling"), but serum threat introduced too late weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound-wave garden functions as micro-setting where resonant vines constrain choices (drumming as communication), charging the final image as "sleeping eye" – environment actively shapes the closure's rebirth motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory ownership) tightens via drumming-to-lullaby cadence shift, reweighting options under Accumulative pressure, but serum threat lacks mid-scene integration to deepen cost before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "seeds their keepers planted" metaphor, resolving into resonant non-literal answer via lagoon's golden hand offering "weave them all into one breathing song" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("tasted of sea salt"), but "auroral sorrow" repetition creates rhythmic flatness during high-pressure lagoon climax, slightly dulling tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural specificity ("liquid ember answering her drumming"), but adjacent "open mouths, open hands, open hearts" creates paraphrase loop in closure beat, costing 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical trauma and sonic ecology feels inevitable, with "drum-everything compulsion" transforming cliché into organic metaphor; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
