<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over contradictory; "reverence" dominates without counter-impulse during decoding. Final choice to "plant knowledge with gestures" lacks prior micro-choices showing struggle against abstraction, though "trembling with cold and reverence" hints at embodied tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orientation delay past 120 words ("golden dock" appears late) triggers -0.4 penalty. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (stepping off dock with "every unspun mile"), but cost proof is thin—lightning's "slow electricity" implies stakes without concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rope functions as micro-setting: constrains decoding through tactile pressure ("bump a syllable his tongue could almost taste") and charges closure ("fulgurite beating faint gold inside"). Snow's "powdery" footprints visually echo the rope’s fragility, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Hara’s tactile decoding ("each bump a syllable"), but escalation lacks visible cost—no moment where failure seems possible. The "infinitely patient" trait creates conceptual pressure yet remains label-heavy until the final walk, missing a mid-beat tradeoff like discarding a seed pouch to save time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "to preserve is to weave, not store" crystallizes through action (coaxing fulgurite into rope), not moralizing. Final image of future children feeling "ancient shock" reweights the premise with conceptual cost—no sentimental resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Hara notices rope textures, not scenery ("knot patterns by touch"). But "velvet pouches of rare grains" slightly overreaches lexicon for a collector; diction stays consistent under pressure though, with rhythmic shifts matching decoding intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Warm as blood" is cliché, and "prayer of salt and pine resin" borders on overwriting. No scaffold or loops detected—sentence rhythm varies effectively (short phrases during decoding, flowing cadence at revelation)—but minor figurative muddle in peak beats prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "knowledge preservation" trope through rope-as-language specificity. Risk-taking (fulgurite as memory conductor) heightens stakes, though "philosophical seed collector" verges on prompt-like. Emotional truth anchors universality in tactile details like "snowflakes on lashes like tiny white moths."</comment>
