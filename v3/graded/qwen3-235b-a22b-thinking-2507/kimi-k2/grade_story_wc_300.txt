<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("seal vs dissolve walls") and embodied emotion ("armor against feeling") earned through confessions; final renunciation of survival-through-forgetting lands with visible cost in the pearl's revelation. Minor deduction as profession doesn't deepen tactical choices beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise when walls turn translucent, revealing silhouettes with undeniable conceptual cost ("Mara understood the pearl had never been an object but a vessel"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly: confession density reweights stakes without causality breaks. Cost legible in "latent radiance finally surfaced".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: quartz veins conduct light to dissolve walls, directly constraining the climax ("light seeped into quartz, threading veins"). Pearl's physical warmth charges the final image; no generic postcard description. One deduction for minor over-reliance on visual cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency: each confession tightens pressure until the vortex of shells forces her final admission. Dominant stake (dissolving emotional walls) forecloses her bunker mentality with felt cost in "I believed survival required forgetting how to love". No reversals needed; deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "cultivated layers grown around abandoned hopes" reframes survival as collective vulnerability. Final image ("world exhaled, walls forgotten") resonates without moralizing, reweighting the premise through "pearl of latent radiance". Avoids thematic echo entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots crunching frost into the heartbeat of hesitation") modulates under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("resonant hush") and paid off in the closing "gentle dark". No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored to Mara's tactile awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with rhythmic control ("The caves sang with resonant hush, quartz veins pulsing faint blue"), but "dissolve" repetition in climax ("dissolving steel," "dissolved ceiling") creates a minor synonym loop. No figurative muddle; density serves momentum without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes through "confessions in seashells" mechanism; emotional specificity ("I told my daughter the sky was painted on concrete") avoids generic trauma. Fresh inflection: bunkers as sites of emotional suppression rather than physical safety. Lacks one bold risk to reach 9.0.</comment>
