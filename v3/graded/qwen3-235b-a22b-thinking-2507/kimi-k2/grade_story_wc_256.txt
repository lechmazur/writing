<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory contradiction ("silence inside her feels heavier than any cathedral bell") and embodied choices (lifting lens, questioning assumptions) earns the closure choice. Micro-choices like passing the lens through the whistle refract motivation organically. No stock phrasing; flaws (inner silence vs. seeking connection) compound realistically without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "she questions the last assumption: that she must leave" forecloses departure, crystallizing her stance with the tuning fork's hum in her chest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens via sound-density escalation (train whistle to lullaby to oceanic hum), reweighting stakes through resonant reconfiguration. Orientation clear by line 3; cost proof in "felt or conceptual" vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The carbide lens functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (refracting sounds, balancing on the fork) and charges the final image ("lens through which the world learns to see"). Laboratory jars aren't backdrop—they supply resources (released sounds) that alter tactics, evolving from labeled curiosities to "gentle planets" orbiting her. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: crisis narrows to tactile vibrations, calmer moments admit golden shadows' depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering connection's texture) tightens through protagonist agency: questioning assumptions deepens understanding until jar-opening choices narrow options. Cost is legible in renunciation of departure ("she questions the last assumption..."), charging the final image. Accumulative escalation—sound density increases (Bakelite laugh to tuning fork hum)—reweights stakes without coincidence. Moral calculus sharpens as she braids lost sounds into sanctuary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the "minute vibration between difference and echo" reweights connection from thread to field, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("texture of connection is not a thread but a field") offers resonant, non-literal answer to the pilgrimage's purpose, earned by refracting the train whistle into "chords she never learned." No thematic echo; complexity lingers via "infinitely gentle, infinitely powerful" ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices sound textures ("hush of a lover's breath on a long-distance wire") and light refractions, with rhythm modulating under pressure ("golden shadows ripple... slow wings" vs. staccato questioning). No filter verbs; diction stays within her lexicon ("prism-song," "tectonic plates shifting continents of memory"). Purposeful elision (off-page city blackout) taught early and paid off in closure's "golden shadows pulse."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere ("spiderweb fracture... splits into a quiet rainbow") or realization. Final line's truncation ("smiles at the way the...") creates intentional resonance without muddle. Figurative language serves purpose: "silence... heavier than any cathedral bell" embodies emotional weight. Information density peaks in closure—"heartbeat made of every voice"—with no overwriting in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "laboratory of lost sounds" transforms trope via verifiable details (Bakelite laugh, prairie train whistle) and emotional specificity (connection as "minute vibration"). The cracked lens isn't symbolic convenience—it's a causal engine refracting sound into texture. Risk-taking heightens stakes: Accumulative structure follows implications of "texture" without retreat, avoiding middle-ground hedging. Proximity check passed—no famous echoes.</comment>
