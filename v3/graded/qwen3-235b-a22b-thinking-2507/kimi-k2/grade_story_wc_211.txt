<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s interior contradiction—archiving dead vows while deaf to living city—drives her final oath. Embodied emotion shines in "wax shaving rearranged into miniature skyline," though epiphany risks slight over-articulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: her whispered oath fractures the cylinder, symbolizing reciprocity’s necessity. Accumulative lens holds as memory immersion tightens stakes, with "archiving required reciprocity" crystallizing the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wax phonograph constrains choices (must speak back when it cracks) and charges the finale (halves form wings). Micro-setting mastery: bark contact and wax shavings directly alter tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via memory immersion deepening knowledge—"prophecy chilled her" narrows options to reciprocity. Cost is visceral: "her heart had grown deaf," made legible when blossoms reverse gravity after her whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: whispering the oath reweights "listening" without moralizing. Final image (blossoms drawn to moon like moths) resonates as non-literal answer to the central question of emotional reciprocity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—"blossoms glowed like pale lanterns" filtered through scribe’s lens—but "accidental prophecy chilled her with velvet disquiet" slightly abstracts emotion where embodiment would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; every line propels meaning. "Shaving of dark crimson wax curled... like dried blood" exemplifies triple-duty prose. Final line’s "heart now beat in time with hers" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional archiving via phonograph in skyscraper orchard transforms tropes. Specificity ("Etruscan, then Hittite") avoids generality; risk-taking (prophecy as "syntax") heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
