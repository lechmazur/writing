<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's micro-choices under pressure (tracing constellations, slipping diagrams) reveal concrete hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of loud rebellion is earned through library's whispers, but lacks genuine struggle—town cooperation feels effortless, weakening moral ambiguity and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "checkmate avoided, game drawn" crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("shelves settling into deeper stillness"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the rebellion method appears fully formed without narrowed options or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto constrains choice (enabling town-wide coordination) and charges closure ("grotto hummed"). Cobalt library's mist reappears as "librarian’s shawl," but town square spatial choreography falters—shuttered shops lack tactile grounding during display setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (books' unfinished regret) tightens via knowledge shift (regret → gratitude), but no live option foreclosed. Cost remains conceptual (library's contentment), never viscerally felt—baker/florist cooperation lacks resistance, leaving escalation passive rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final stars ("possibility endless") reweights "past meets prophecy" into non-literal answer without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through particulars—accountant's merger reversal shows earned wisdom—but "humble rebellion" phrasing risks thematic echo, slightly muddying organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara notices through chess lens ("cradle idea like fragile rook"). Rhythm accelerates during grotto scene, but filter-verb stacks ("she heard," "she felt") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy where compression should heighten tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; concrete verbs ("croissants into knights") compress occupation/theme. But template cadence mars climax: "A baker shaped... florist braided... watchmaker set" creates drumbeat rhythm that dulls the pivotal display activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "magnetic grotto" transforms quiet rebellion trope—iron-rich stone tugging compass needles grounds universality. Emotional specificity avoids cliché, but "humble rebellion" concept lacks bold risk-taking; safe middle avoids deeper societal friction.</comment>
