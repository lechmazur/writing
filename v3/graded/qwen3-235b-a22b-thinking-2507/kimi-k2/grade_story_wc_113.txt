<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's liminal existence ("between stage and audience, sound and silence") driving her to disrupt the legend she's drawn to; embodied choices like reading silence as language and playing the clarinet bell against water show earned agency without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the receding flood and blank program crystallize the cost of transformed understanding ("The music is the space between..."), with the single note suspending Mara and ghost in shared breath under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation clear by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded opera house functions as micro-setting: water actively constrains movement (knee-deep rise), creates ghostly glyphs, and charges the final image via receding flood; lantern reflections on water make walls "breathe," directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation tightens under Accumulative lens as Mara follows ripples into rising water while lanterns dim, narrowing options to perform the code; cost is visceral in the flood's recession and program's transformation, driven by her agency (tilting clarinet to spill the note).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: water glyphs and negative-space clef reweight "in between spaces" into earned wisdom ("music is the space between what we remember and what we forget"), avoiding moralizing while charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through musicality ("silence composing a symphony of anticipation"), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure; no head-hopping, and lyrical compression ("flickering lanterns turning the hall into a trembling kaleidoscope") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("droplets slid off, carrying flecks of gold leaf that glittered like suspended stars" does triple duty); final line’s ellipsis ("began not with overture but with") recharges motifs without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through musician’s specificity: water as "solvent and quill" for ghostly communication and "negative space" as performance method feel inevitable yet fresh, with emotional truth in silence-as-language avoiding generic abstraction.</comment>
