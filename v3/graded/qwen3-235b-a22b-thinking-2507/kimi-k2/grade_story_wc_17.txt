<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "sensitively perceptive" trait is told not shown during sensory overload. Epiphany about legacy's burden feels unearned as no prior struggle with secrecy versus truth is dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (note redefining legacy's burden) with conceptual cost, but the cost ("hiding deepens sorrow") isn't sufficiently legible on-page during the climax beat where ribs rattle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ivy passage functions as active micro-setting: sound mapping constraints drive choices, and fossilized starlight bricks charge the final image. Only minor slip: "fossilized starlight" borders on overwrought abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. protection) deepen texturally but lack meaningful resistance; diaries/film strip yield secrets too readily without Mara's active struggle. Pressure accumulates but no palpable cost shapes tactics until the very end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "negative light" mechanics and the note's rewrite of "legacy's burden." Avoids moralizing; final image ("sky the color of old photographs") resonates without stating the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound mapping) shines, but "sensitively perceptive" repeats as filter rather than embodied trait. Overwritten moments like "ivy threading cracks like green nerves" slightly disrupt rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("half-burned diaries found in the fireplace" x4) and one mixed metaphor ("bricks sighed, dreaming of nebulae"). Final line’s rhythm perfectly resolves the cadence shift, but scaffold lingers in middle beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms climate grief through sound cartography; "negative light" mechanics feel inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "walls that breathe" edges toward familiar metaphor.</comment>
