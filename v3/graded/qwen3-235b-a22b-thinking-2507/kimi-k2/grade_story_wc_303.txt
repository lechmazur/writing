<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (grandmother's dismissal vs plant telepathy), but accidental telepathy lacks rooted struggle; micro-choices like touching seed shape reveal values, yet flaw integration feels slightly convenient rather than compounding under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: empire arrives to find transformed space, violin's final note seeding rebellion. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (coffee islands bleeding, melting runes), orientation clear by 40 words with velvet observatory/starlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Velvet observatory micro-setting actively constrains choice—starlight refracting through violin creates melting runes that reweight pruned futures, directly charging the final image where dome becomes hothouse of snow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency: coffee reading deepens knowledge ("perforated destiny as permeability"), tightening via starlight refraction that reweights stakes; cost legible as empire's arrival meets irreversible propagation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—thawing violin completes its purpose—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("scales made of starlight and chlorophyll") offers resonant answer to "weigh dream against empire" without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("mulberry ache," "frost remembering wind"), rhythm modulates perfectly with pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s fragmented "the" as earned stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "poured coffee so dark it reflected constellations" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor deduction for "accidentally telepathic" register drift amid lyrical flow, but peak beats avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific integration: "perforated destiny" shifts from loss to root pathways, with empire’s sigil dissolving into seed. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
