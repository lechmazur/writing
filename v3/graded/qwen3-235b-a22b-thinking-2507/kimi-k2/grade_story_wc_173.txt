<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in chastity-as-weapon compels action; micro-choices during unraveling earn closure. Limited internal contradiction beyond surface resolve weakens 9+ potential despite embodied emotion ("fingers trembling from reverence").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("weight of every echo settle into her bones"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through echo-density escalation; lens named by midpoint with seamless pressure buildup to shattering climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (threads beneath snow) and charges closure (dissolving walls, absorbed prism). Snow/marble details evolve causally with events, avoiding static postcard syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each untangled thread intensifies pressure until sanctuary shatters. Cost unmistakable in final image—"prism warm against her ribs" reweights empire's silence with visceral consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "empire’s lullaby" falters via children’s strange words, not abstract statement. Final image offers resonant answer to erasure—memory spreading like scent of lavender—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("snow caught starlight like glass shards") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure’s lyrical precision without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light poured out—not gentle, but searing" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle, even in peak beats where snow turns to steam.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transformation of resistance trope through prism logic and quiet aftermath (no statues, only shared memories). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring emotional truth of collective remembrance.</comment>
