<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Lira absorbs grief yet releases it through action, embodied via salt-biting palms and memory-infused fingertips. Micro-choices like guiding the spirit’s hands reveal her truth-centric hierarchy under pressure. Minor flaw: her "broken mask" flaw lacks visible mistake-compounding, but length excuses depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: spirits depart but Lira’s promise ("I will return") crystallizes cyclical cost—"weight lighten, though she knew tomorrow new silences would begin." Accumulative lens holds; knot-unraveling density shift narrows options toward cloud-pricking. Cost proof: "lighten... though" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary actively constrains choice—knots bind souls, starlight refracts grief into actionable specters. Tapestry needle (micro-setting) charges closure: pricking the cloud transforms it from tool to "conductor’s baton," then "pen that finished a letter." Sensory specificity (frosting breath, barnacle-scraped memories) avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: each knot undone deepens hush while releasing names, escalating toward cloud-pricking. Cost is unmistakable—"weight lighten, though she knew tomorrow new silences would begin." Moral calculus (truth vs. forgetting) sharpens the exhume action; no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: knots as "vows of silence," names as "silver scales" the sea swallowed. Final image—"mask... stitched with threads of silence set free"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting grief as cyclical liberation. Avoids thematic echo; silence’s dissolution implies earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: restoration-focused diction ("fracture was a doorway," "lacework of absences") mirrors Lira’s profession. Rhythm modulates perfectly—dense metaphors during knot work, sparse lines post-release ("ordinary night sounds"). Zero head-hopping; "accumulates silence" typo minor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("tapestry needle... filament of moonlight" establishes character/object/atmosphere). Figurative language purposeful—silence as "frost thickening on glass," cloud unraveled into "soft nets of sleep." Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "broken mask restorer" applied to grief-absorption, "exhume names" as emotional labor. Specificity elevates tropes—moonlight-threaded needle, silver-scale silences. Risk-taking (accumulative structure over causal) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; "tide of forgetting" made visceral.</comment>
