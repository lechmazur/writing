<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Guard's dreamlessness and cultivation motive feel consistent, but interior contradiction lacks embodied escalation; archive interaction reveals values yet emotional progression remains abstract despite vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when flames "pollinate" embers—visible cost of perpetual burning reconfigures the guard's purpose, though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) slightly weakens causality at transition to mirage door.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phosphorescent blossoms and chess clock constrain choices (planting clock, humming lullabies); final forest's glass leaves charge closure by feeding on "absence of what was lost," meeting 9+ gate through micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when guard presses spark into clock—agency-driven escalation narrows options to cultivation versus preservation, with felt cost in recurring burning forest; secondary stake (dreams vs. sparks) lacks sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final line "The sparks you seek are the dreams you guard" reweights the premise through concrete action (soft flames pollinating), avoiding moralizing while crystallizing theme via image; thematic echo avoided through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand pulsing like a slow heart," "twin faces stopped at the same black second") persists under pressure; rhythmic control falters only when "probability tides he feels in his teeth" strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dense imagery occasionally obscures momentum ("edges curling like burnt paper" during critical exchange); no loops but stacked modifiers in high-pressure beats (archive dialogue) slightly dull immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive metaphors with ecological renewal—burning forest that "pollinates" avoids cliché while feeling inevitable; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
