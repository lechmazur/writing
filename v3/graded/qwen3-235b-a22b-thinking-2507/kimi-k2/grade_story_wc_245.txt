<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between mapping impulse and emotional avoidance crystallizes in the stillpoint confrontation; embodied grief ("tasted of salt and cedar") avoids label-speak while the ring’s pigment absorption shows external/internal divergence. Micro-choice to name grief earns closure with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: naming grief widens the stillpoint, transforming her from mapmaker to "living chart." Accumulative lens holds throughout—sensory density tightens toward the melody’s completion—while the ring’s lavender glow to cooled silver traces persistent constraint. Cost legible in "swallowed words" becoming mapped rivers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and compass ring function as micro-setting, constraining every choice: moss read as braille, quartz trunks humming like tuning forks. Final image of the ring "turning gently" charged by prior absorption of "whale, wind, violin" proves environment charges closure. No generic placeholder details; sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (crisis narrows to vibration decoding).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating uncharted emotional depths) signaled immediately and deepens through musical notes’ density shift from "silver droplets" to "melody that tasted of salt." Agency-driven escalation: her barefoot tracking and naming of grief narrow options to a single path with felt cost ("grief" as missing chord). Orion’s backward step crystallizes the earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "coastlines of sorrow" and "rivers of every word swallowed" reweight mapping as self-discovery without moralizing. Final image of the ring "aligned to the hidden stillpoint she now carried beneath her tongue" offers non-literal answer to the central question—grief as compass—avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature defined by tactile synesthesia ("vibrations soaked like ink," "melody tasted of salt") remains consistent under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from measured ("pulse steadied") to urgent ("melody tightened") without syntactic monotony. Elision of sight loss backstory taught early via lullaby pressed into wrist, paying off in pigment absorption mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density where every line advances atmosphere ("starlight pooled like liquid mercury") or character ("quiet blaze of determination"). Figurative language serves Accumulative lens without muddle—cedar/salt melody concretizes grief. Final line’s "language the leaves had not yet invented" achieves propulsion while recharging the compass ring’s purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker trope transformed through ultrasonic forest mechanics and emotional cartography. Fresh synthesis: platinum ring absorbing "pigment" as heat/texture makes abstraction visceral. Risk-taking (lyric structure, sensory mapping) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the stillpoint’s "inhale and exhale" balance feels inevitable in hindsight, charging closure with emotional specificity.</comment>
