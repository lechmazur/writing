<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Embodied grief via somatic markers avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (survivor identity vs. hope) crystallize in micro-choice of writing "Still possible" with visible cost in rearranged bodily signals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: somatic markers shift from "warning" to "witness" when she leaves the photo, foreclosing denial without resolution. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Olive tree micro-setting constrains choice (pressing photo to bark to feel sap heartbeat) and charges closure as "guardian" of the planted memory, transforming setting from backdrop to active participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening somatic markers reweights the dominant stake (can grief coexist with hope?) with cost visible when her lungs "freeze mid-breath" then later "rearrange," narrowing options to acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silt metaphor—"grief simply sat beside her like a guest"—avoiding moralizing while offering resonant answer: optimism anchored in realism requires holding both sorrow and breath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("repeating phrase until species name," "somatic markers") modulates rhythm during panic attack; no head-hopping, with lexicon rooted in trauma's physicality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "paper thin at folds, almost translucent, like skin" demonstrates high-density prose. Final line’s cadence shift ("arboretum kept its cliffside") perfects propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma tropes via specific details (olive tree in cliff crack, writing on photo), but "pearl of stillness" concept slightly familiar. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through earned specificity.</comment>
