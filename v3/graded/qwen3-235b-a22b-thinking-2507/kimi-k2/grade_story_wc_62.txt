<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's embodied emotion ("throat tightened," "voice steady as winter iron") and contradictory impulses—carving stone versus understanding migration—drive authentic choices. Micro-decisions like unspooling the ribbon tie to her grief arc, though off-page family members lack pressure. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws feel genuine in her need to "shape that motion into stone."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the mentor dissolving into "pollen and dusk" crystallizes grief's reconfiguration from monument to migration, with felt cost in Mara's solitary "fiercely meditative" return. Accumulative lens holds—each ribbon-unspooling deepens the stone-carving metaphor toward the final image of collective grief shifting "from stone to flock."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse's "shallow grooves that caught rain and reflected sky" directly enable the butterfly motif that charges closure. Stone-carving mechanics constrain choices (Mara follows the ribbon's map), while "bruised citrus" and "pale snow" pollen create tactile specificity that mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency: her refusal to trade a poem escalates to carving "not to fix the path but to honor its passing." The cost—losing spectral guidance for purpose—forecloses her initial stone-lifting struggle. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the "weeks" time jump slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the epitaph "space between them" and stone's river/wing etching reweight grief as movement without moralizing. Final image ("flock taking shape against the sky") offers a resonant answer to "shape of collective grief," avoiding Thematic Echo by embedding insight in the whispered stanza.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wings beat overhead like distant drums," "citrus and loam") modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression ("decades of being unspooled") is taught early and paid off in the ribbon's transformation. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally from Mara's throat tightening to the wider butterfly vortex.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; lines like "pollen drifted like pale snow" advance atmosphere and theme. Near-loop on "thundering calm" (3x) feels intentional as motif, but the "weeks" transition risks slight momentum drag. Final line’s rhythm ("listening for the next thundering calm") flawlessly recharges the motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific stone-carving lens: the epitaph "carve not names but the space between them" feels fresh, avoiding abstraction with mica flecks and ribbon mechanics. Emotional truth in Mara’s struggle to "shape sorrow" into recognizable form, though not radically innovative beyond its synthesis.</comment>
