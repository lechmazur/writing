<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (methodical precision vs. suppressed grief) manifest in micro-choices like numbered brushstrokes preceding tearful release. Final endurance of absence as closure earns visible cost through Elias’ embodied tears and the woman’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the painted iris gazing into stone’s darkness crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("stranger’s absence hurts as much as your own"). Accumulative lens holds as density increase (voids merging) reweights empathy’s stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Quarry functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (shadowed ledge selection) and charges closure via "stone’s darkness" for the painted eye’s gaze. Mist evolves from erased evidence to "returning fog," directly altering tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’ agency: painting voids narrows options until ribbon fragments unite, forcing stance crystallization. Cost legible in "tears... warm against cold mist" and the woman’s dissolution, reweighting dominant stake (truth through art) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via the painted iris—a resonant answer to "how does empathy transcend identity?"—avoiding moralizing. Woman’s whispered line earns thematic weight through the charged reunion, resisting tidy binaries by embracing ambiguity of "the whole lie."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "counting paces the way others recognize smiles" and ash/gesso color logic reflect Elias’ face-blind artistry. Rhythmic control tightens under pressure ("voids touched, ribbon fluttered") with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "furrowed hush" repetition functions as patterned motif. High density ("lash of midnight shaped like a clef") avoids muddle. Final line’s "ribbon fused... like a scar" delivers closure image with precise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Face-blind artist investigating via negative space transforms true-crime tropes. Emotional specificity ("distance between cheekbone and grief") avoids abstraction, though premise risks slight familiarity without the ribbon’s irreplaceable role in closure.</comment>
