<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines ("palms sweated," "throat tightened") with "cautiously hopeful" driving micro-choices like the fader adjustment. Tricksters remain abstract antagonists, limiting relationship dynamics despite strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tight: interference → retaliation → phase-shift gamble. Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("Lyra slumped," comet's "apologetic" light), but the town's unity shift lacks visceral felt consequence in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Radio station's transmitter and charts constrain choices (amplitude risks, phase calculations). "Tubes glowing like coals" and "spooling tape like black water" charge the final image, though campus quad unity feels slightly detached from the basement setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: subsonic signal war narrows options to Lyra's phase-shift gamble. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the comet's altered tail, but the inversion threat ("compassion into contempt") resolves too neatly without deeper communal consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "fear transmuted into vigilance" crystallizes in the final lullaby drifting over a fractured town. No moralizing—just the comet's "softer" light reweighting cosmic power plays through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("17.3 hertz," "quarter-second delay" as character-particular noticing). "Burnt sugar and regret" slightly overreaches POV plausibility, but rhythmic control during signal war ("glass dragged across teeth") anchors stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "spooling magnetic tape like black water" compresses time/image. Minor density issue—"ethereal grit of cosmic politics" risks mixed metaphor—prevents 8.8+, though closure beat remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic horror via audio engineering specificity (subsonic warfare, phase shifts). "Cautiously hopeful" as tactical mindset—not just mood—avoids tropes, though tricksters' motives lack fresh inflection beyond "puppeteers."</comment>
