<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (preserve memory vs survival) drives the perfume-drop climax; embodied emotion in "memories rose—her mother’s laugh" avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: micro-choices lack visible struggle during coral snarling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise when Mara chooses the surrender moment; cost (mother’s smile fading) is legible in "began to fade from her mind." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through hush density shifts. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perfume vial constrains the climax choice and charges the final image ("empty yet luminous"). Sensory hierarchy sharpens under pressure: algae-filmed constellations early, gardenia scent blooming mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via HUD countdown (43→31→20 min), narrowing options to surrender memory for survival. Cost (irreversible memory loss) is unmistakable when "mother’s face flashed, vivid, unbearably tender" then fades.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial’s evolution: from preserved memory to surrendered object to "empty yet luminous" vessel. Final image ("candle no storm could touch") reweights surrender as power without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: marine scientist’s precise observations ("HUD blinked red") blended with poetic interiority. Rhythm modulates under stress—short clauses during coral snarling, flowing cadence in reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "ghost of gardenias spiraling through cold water" achieves high density. Minor overwriting in "gathered hush" explanation (lines 11-12) slightly blurs immediacy during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "magical artifact" trope through marine archaeology specificity (coral-fused circuitry) and emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet closure ("lonesome splendor no surface glare could reach") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
