<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses in action; "awkward confidence" shown physically yet closure choice (transmitting coordinates) lacks prior micro-tactical tradeoffs to deepen earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stones quieting while spaceport stirs crystallizes the rebellion's underground persistence with felt cost (her shift from observer to messenger), under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opera glasses and stone circle constrain choices (projecting coordinates onto tug) and charge final image (rust into constellations), transforming micro-setting into indispensable narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory accumulation (hum rising to chord) narrows options to transmission; cost legible in her run toward responsibility, though "lull in rebellion" stake could deepen tactical friction earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (rust constellations, hum as signal), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "lull" as transition without stating the central question's answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thunderous serenity," coolant drip as heartbeat) modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping, but minor syntactic uniformity in high-tension beats slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("brass touched granite with a soft chime") with precise propulsion, though "luminous whales" metaphor slightly strains physical logic without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ancient mysticism and rebellion (stones as transmitters) avoids tropes through specific details (banned symphonic recordings); risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
