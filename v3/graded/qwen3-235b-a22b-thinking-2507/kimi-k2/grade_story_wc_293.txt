<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic but risks abstraction; "luminous disbelief" and "pixelated amnesty" verge on thematic labels without sufficient embodied contradiction in peak moments. Hitchhiker functions as symbol over character, weakening relationship crucible despite strong micro-choices like tucking flake under chin rest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "never" becomes bridge cables with visible cost (hitchhiker fading). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but hitchhiker's reappearance lacks causal setup, weakening escalation. Cost proof solid in "erasing 'never' from her tongue" and final surrender-flag scaffold wrap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: gravel-to-pixels transition actively constrains movement, scaffold wrap flutters spell coordinates, fog dragon dissolution charges final image. Environment directly shapes climax (climbing staircase of light), satisfying 9+ gate with tool-as-setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("never") tightens through pixel lattice entry and hitchhiker's fading, but escalation feels passive—magic systems (flake, scaffold) resolve rather than test agency. Cost legible in loss of hitchhiker, yet pressure lacks earned struggle against internal limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "never" transforms from barrier to bridge material without moralizing. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost (hitchhiker scattering into light), but "pixelated amnesty" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: fiddler hears scaffold flutters as sheet music, fuses sensory/rhythmic control with "dynamically observant" POV. Minor register drift in "lattice of impossible doors" but pattern taught early; lyric compression pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax, high density ("melody started low, a drone like tires on wet asphalt"), but "luminous disbelief" verbatim repeat (para 1 & 10) triggers paraphrase loop. Figurative language sparse in high-pressure beats, preserving clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: wet-plate photography meets digital pixelation as tangible "never" alchemy. Risk-taking (scaffold wrap as Morse code) heightens stakes, but bridge motif feels derivative despite specific execution. Transformation test passed—plot fails if setting/tech swapped.</comment>
