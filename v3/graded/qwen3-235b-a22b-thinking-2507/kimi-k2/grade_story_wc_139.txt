<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lila’s contradictory impulses—loyalty warring with moral revulsion—act simultaneously in high-stakes beats (e.g., whispering apology while calculating "one death equals one life"). Her embodied emotion avoids labels; the ink pot’s weight manifests inherited guilt physically. Minor deduction: external behavior/internal tension distinction slightly muted during the cap-click moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "fairness was not a number but a process" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (complicity as inheritance). Causal lens holds perfectly—Lila’s active waiting creates the breach, driving the decisive document switch. Orientation anchors (prep room, Alvarez’s corpse) by line 3, avoiding disorientation penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (enabling the distraction) and charges the final image ("darkness ready to liquefy rigid certainties"). Sensory details (formaldehyde-lilies scent, iron-violet ink) reflect Lila’s urgency and bias, avoiding white-room syndrome. No generic placeholder; every detail pressures the forgery attempt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (securing the seal for asylum) tightens meaningfully when the director’s return forces Lila to exploit the "breach." Escalation driven solely by her agency—waiting actively, weaponizing the ink pot’s scent—and cost (moral complicity) is legible in the final pocket gesture. No coincidence resolves conflict; the breach arises from her taught patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the ink pot’s residue embodies "guilt spreads outward," and the final line reweights "mathematics of fair trade" as an ongoing process without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries—Lila gains asylum but inherits corruption. Subtext operates in Alvarez’s rigor-mortis smile, charged by the earlier apology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lila’s perceptual signature—counting heartbeats in "Mississippi," noticing "paper-cut" suspicion—is distinct and stress-modulated. Rhythmic control heightens pressure ("palms open, counting heartbeats... until certainty liquefies"). Minor deduction: the director’s dialogue slightly flattens under stress, though Lila’s internal voice remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels plot or deepens theme (e.g., "scent of iron and violet rose like a ghost" advances both distraction and moral residue). Figurative language stays coherent under pressure—no mixed metaphors. Final line’s "spilling pale ink across the city" recharges the ink pot motif with devastating clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms asylum tropes through specific moral calculus: fairness as "continuous revision" of borders, not transactional math. Emotional truth in Lila’s conflicted pragmatism ("borrowed shoes" for condolences) avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (ink as liquefying agent for rigid systems) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable by the dawn reprise.</comment>
