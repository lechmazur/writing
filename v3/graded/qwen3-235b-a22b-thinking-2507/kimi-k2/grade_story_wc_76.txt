<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refusal rather than hope" and micro-choices like aligning discs under salt fog, but "gut-ache" abstraction slightly dilutes embodied cost during the stone's destruction. Final asymmetrical smile earns change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("universe hesitating, foot half lifted") lands with undeniable conceptual cost—"waves crawl uphill" proves stakes. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly, though the "private chuckle" muddies cost legibility by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hunger stone's "drilled channels" and yoyo's "frayed silk cord" directly constrain ritual choices, charging the closure via "dull snow" powder and Moebius loop. Micro-setting mastery elevates beyond vivid description to causal necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marrow's agency—splicing stone into axle narrows options to "one potential flashing forward." Cost ("sea birds forget how wings fold") is visceral, but "cosmic grain" phrasing risks abstracting the conflict slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "latent radiance" as dormant ellipses, reweighted in the final "sweet scent" without moralizing. The asymmetrical smile offers non-literal resolution to "can chaos be harnessed?" with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("salt fog settles on brass like frozen breath"), with rhythm modulating under pressure ("crooked increments—no steady climb"). Minor register drift in "unsponsored by any god" barely mars consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "zigzagging over black water in absurd Morse" exemplifies textural specificity. Slight register drift in "icy, frank" during high-pressure beat prevents 9.0, but propulsion remains flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" transforms abstract chaos into tangible physics (ellipses of brightness), while the Moebius yoyo reconfigures time non-gimmickly. Specific synthesis feels inevitable—remove "widdershins" detail and the premise collapses.</comment>
