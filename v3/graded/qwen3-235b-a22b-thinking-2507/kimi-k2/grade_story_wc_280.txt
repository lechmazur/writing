<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; ghost’s sole drive to "lure possibility" lacks competing internal tensions. Final dissolution earned yet feels inevitable rather than chosen under duress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the "hush before overture" crystallizes time’s fragility with palpable cost as her form dissolves into motes. Accumulative lens holds as echoes braided into a resolving chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mystic orchard constrains every choice—the coin’s spin scatters years through apple trunks, and the split-lightning tree drinks metal to project spotlights. Final image of street gate hinges on this setting’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory deepening: coin’s thinning song warns of collapse, then echoes swell into ovations. Cost is felt in the minor-key chord and frost beneath roots, tightening pressure toward the dance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment>Theme emerges through action: "fragile, luminous thread" reweights the premise without moralizing. But "despair lurking beneath roots" slightly overstates; ambiguity risks neatness in final bow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dew that is also stage light," "cymbal crash only synesthetically blessed could hear." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("pirouette produces echoes that bounce... returning louder").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels atmosphere ("blossoms fall upward, reforming on branches not yet grown"). Final-third artifacts absent, but "synesthetically blessed" borders on label-speak without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost’s encore-seeking heart intertwining with tomorrow’s dew transforms death trope. Risk-taking (fractured timeline as sensory mosaic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making the "hush" inevitable.</comment>
