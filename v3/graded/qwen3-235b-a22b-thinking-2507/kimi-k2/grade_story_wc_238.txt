<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exorcist's embodied emotion shines ("voice roughened by sleepless nights and ether"), but ghost's internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in scene; micro-choices like perfume application reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when ghost dissolves with "pressure of forgiven silence," cost crystallized in stumps "glistened like open mouths mid-phrase"; Accumulative lens holds with orchard destruction tightening tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sheet music archive functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (copper pipes for induced currents) and charges final image (stumps as "open mouths"); sawdust "haloed like stardust" reweights orchard's destruction through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency as chainsaws start during apology, narrowing options to metaphorical delivery; cost is unmistakable in "stumps glistened like open mouths mid-phrase" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through apple-seed rest charging prior material without moralizing; final image ("ghost rehearsed the requiem... in another key") offers resonant answer to "imperfect miracle" question via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "margins scarred by salt rings" and "fallen scales," rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "induced currents" slightly disrupts voice-motivated lexicon during high-stakes ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "a faint current of bergamot and regret drifted out, stirring the dust into slow spirals"; single paraphrase loop in archivist's "stories, like ghosts" line costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through specific details (perfume carrying "evaporated longing," apology via musical metaphors); synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight with orchard singing "in another key" heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
