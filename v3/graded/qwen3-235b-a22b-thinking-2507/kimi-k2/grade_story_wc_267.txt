<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the bolt examination scene: numb fingers feeling "tiny teeth" while choosing observation over action. Micro-choice to study the bolt rather than investigate the scream reveals hierarchy of values (silence > safety) with embodied cost ("first sting of returning nerves").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "stepped outside" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost (collapsing fortress, "stone under stars"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the bolt's discovery deepens the dominant stake through patterned escalation ("bruised lavender" banister to "snow falling upward"), with cost legible in "walls cracking like thawing skin".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress functions as active antagonist: its "smooth as frozen lake" surface directly constrains the gate-opening choice, while the discolored banister ("bruised lavender") charges the final descent. The bolt’s physicality ("threads catch against his skin") makes the conceptual cost tactile, elevating micro-setting to closure-defining constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by textural deepening: the bolt’s "hairline crack" transforms the fortress’s silence from covenant to devourer, narrowing options to "carry the bolt down" or "stay until snow." Cost is unmistakable in "boots sinking into snow that tasted of salt and old songs"—a visceral price for memory’s return that reweights safety’s meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "the cost of safety is forgetting" reframed by the bolt’s physical crack and final "stone under stars." No moralizing—only resonant image of snow falling upward reweights the premise, with emotional aftereffect in "first word... 'Enough'" charged by prior sensory details (salt-tasting snow, clinking key).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "corridors hushed as held breath" filters setting through conditioned numbness. Under stress, syntax compresses ("He crouched, fingertips still numb") while maintaining rhythmic control. Voice modulates from glacial observation ("seraphically mundane") to thawing urgency ("felt the first sting") without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture. "Snow began to fall upward" demonstrates masterful concision—reconfigures the premise while avoiding figurative muddle. Final line’s "stone under stars" achieves maximum density: erases fortress mythology with three concrete words, no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted fortress" trope through specific logic: danger-devouring memory replaces supernatural threats. Risk-taking (snow falling upward) heightens stakes without gimmickry, while "nerve regeneration" grounds metaphor in bodily truth. Emotional specificity in "frostbitten hope" avoids generic templates.</comment>
