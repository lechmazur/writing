<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority embodied through textile metaphors ("swallowed thorn," "threads snapping") avoids therapy-speak; final renunciation of hearing reply earns Earned Stasis with visceral cost in "heart lighter yet heavier." Slight abstraction in "stoically sparkling" tears limits full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Lira's smile while gathering apples crystallizes the cost of one-way hope. Accumulative lens holds: pressure deepens via sensory density (bamboo rattling, puzzle pieces) to reweight silence as bridge. Cost unmistakable in "she would never hear reply."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting: cracked basin enables sap discovery, moss-laden trunks mute footsteps forcing alternative communication. Final image of "silence... rewoven into a bridge" charges closure through environment. Dew "like glassy tears" risks cliché but redeemed by narrative context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sending "return" across impossible distance) tightens through deepening: couriers fail → dream reveals puzzle → bead fuses silence into conduit. Agency drives escalation; cost (thimble sacrifice, accepting one-way hope) visibly alters tactics and final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through amber bead's transformation: silence evolves from obstacle to message carrier. Final image ("silence itself can be rewoven into a bridge") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting "raveling" as active connection rather than loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via textile lexicon ("heddle," "warp threads") reflecting Lira's craft. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry") to sparse ("Understanding dawned like cold water") under pressure. No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "glassy tears" and "stoically sparkling" adjacent phrasing slightly dilutes momentum in opening beat. Final paragraph achieves high density ("steps recommencing... grief from turning to stone") with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope via textile physics: amber bead isn't vessel but silence-seal needing fusion. "Raveling silence" as active medium feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
