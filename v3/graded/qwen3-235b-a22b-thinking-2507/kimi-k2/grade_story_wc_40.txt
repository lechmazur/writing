<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (decoding vs surrender) earned through micro-choices like speaking "Mother"; embodied emotion in "tears blurred dawn light" avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: minimal prior demonstration of over-analysis flaw compounding before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("library exhale"/"grow again") with felt cost (surrendering scholarly identity) under Accumulative lens. Hairline slip: recursive growth insight precedes climax beat, slightly diluting escalation pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crystal/chandelier) constrains choices—placing crystals back alters tactics; "dawn light" evolution charges final image. Environment as active participant meets 9+ gate without generic placeholder risks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode vs surrender) tightens through scholar's testimony choice; cost (tears, shifted identity) visible and legible. Agency-driven escalation under textural lens, though secondary stake (library's survival) lacks mid-story friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal's sonic memory ("recursive growth"), avoiding moralizing; final "grow again" reweights "hush" non-literally. Near-slip: "recursive" explanation slightly over-articulates the earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sonically reflective facets," linguistic details); rhythmic control intensifies during "fractured sequences." Zero head-hopping; compression taught early ("murmured testimonies") and paid off in closure chord.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "pale blade of light" to "sliding gold" progression shows textural specificity. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle—"cobwebs" shawl metaphor deepens without obscuring cause/effect in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library tropes via sonic memory; emotional specificity in "printer cursing misaligned page" avoids genericity. Derivative risk in "decoding growth" premise mitigated by concrete execution, but not fully transformative.</comment>
