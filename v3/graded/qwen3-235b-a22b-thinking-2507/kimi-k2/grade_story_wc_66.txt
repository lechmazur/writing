<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (diligence vs scarcity) drive micro-choices: lifting dust as ink substitute shows value hierarchy with visible cost when no paper remains. Motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is embodied through tactile actions, avoiding abstract labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands unmistakably: gathering motes into a vial forecloses immediate storytelling with tears tasting "salt and ink and distant thunder" as visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds through dust reconfigurations without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (no paper forces dust-as-ink substitution) and charges closure (vial at heart). The radio dial's "submarine light" evolves from tool to symbol of narrative rebirth, shaping every escalation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake tightening through density increase: dust shifts from floor spirals → phantom book → luminous motes, narrowing options to preservation. Cost is legible in the vial-tucking gesture with "tears mixing with dust" reweighting the famine's toll under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of the vial "next to her heart" offers non-literal answer to narrative survival without moralizing. Theme emerges through dust's transformation ("dust remembers every footstep") reweighted by the pirate's whisper "until ears grow hungry again," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("thistled calm," "submarine light") remains consistent under pressure. Compression taught early ("mist clung to broken columns like unfinished phrases") pays off in dust-book scene without scaffold; musical lexicon stays within copyist's plausible expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops: "tasting salt and ink and distant thunder" conveys three sensory costs in one phrase. High density without muddle—"dust rearranged itself into the shape of a small book" shows concrete action where lesser prose would tell. Final line recharges "ember" motif with "pale stars."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "story famine" trope through dust-as-medium specificity. Emotional truth in "librarian who shelved laughter in glass jars" avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking (lyric broadcast mechanics) heightens stakes coherently—pirate's "driftwood baton" feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
