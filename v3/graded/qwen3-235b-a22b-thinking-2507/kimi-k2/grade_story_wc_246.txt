<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives micro-choices like editing "they flourished" to "they endured," with embodied cost (tasting iron). Final renunciation—walking away penless—earned by edits' emotional toll, though internal conflict could deepen beyond surface-level doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the fountain learning to "fall downward again" crystallizes her shift from thresher to witness with visceral cost (raw throat, snapped pen). Accumulative lens holds as each edit tightens narrative density without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (slowing time for edits) and charges the closure (water spirals reconfiguring gravity). Pen’s "fossil of intention" in the fountain directly reweights the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: each edit ("unbending the lie") narrows options by spawning new sorrows, with visceral cost (planet shuddering, iron taste). Moral calculus between mercy/justice makes the cost unmistakable when "grief widened, more honest now."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fountain’s transformation—"meaning isn’t threshed, it’s watered"—avoiding moralizing. Final image of upward-falling water recharging into downward flow offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hair floating like pale smoke," "timelines braided so tightly they cut the wrists of causality") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in compression ("She unbent the lie, straightened it into a confession") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("harvest had turned to thorns") propels momentum. Minor overwriting in "causality’s wrists" is justified by voice, but "confidently uncertain" repetition risks thematic echo without sufficient variation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "editing history" trope through specific, grounded choices: pen as "comet’s apology," gardening metaphor for meaning-making. Emotional truth in exhaustion ("hands shook, confidently uncertain") avoids generic templates, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening coherence.</comment>
