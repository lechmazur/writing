<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trembling yet sure" fingers and "nervously confident heart stuttered," but substitution cost lacks sufficient internal wrestling during the mirror climax; trait embodiment strong yet pivotal choice feels slightly under-pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Morag's emergence crystallizes exile's cost through "sea-etched" reflection, with jet stream's ghost battering walls as tangible pressure; accumulative lens (stanza-by-stanza escalation) held rigorously to the final pinning of the nail.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Weather station actively constrains choices: meridian ring enables nail alignment, barographs' "jittering" raises stakes, and "spongey dread" physically oozes up calves; final image of "instruments sang in unfamiliar harmonies" charges closure through setting's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening via stanza progression ("lights flicker" → "hatch descends" → "mirrors fogged") drives irreversible choice; cost is unmistakable in Lila's aging reflection and Morag's silent question, with jet stream's ghost intensifying pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>"Bravery wasn’t a single act but a lineage" risks thematic echo but is saved by immediate concrete action (stepping aside); final image of "archipelagos no atlas had ever named" resonates non-literally with exile's reversibility, though ancestral wisdom leans slightly toward earned insight rather than pure subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "coastlines gone obsolete," "stanzas fluttered like trapped moths," and "shadows pooling like spilled ink" filter world through map librarian’s eyes; rhythmic control under pressure ("counting steps in the same meter as the stanzas") avoids head-hopping despite mirror multiplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spongey dread" repetition is pattern-taught payoff, though "nervously confident" appears twice with minimal evolution in high-pressure beats (-0.1); final line’s "temperature anomalies" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather systems as exile metaphors avoids trope through specific "jet stream’s ghost" mechanics; risk-taking (mirror lineage chamber) heightens stakes coherently, though copper nail borders on familiar relic without its blunted-point payoff in closure.</comment>
