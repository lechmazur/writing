<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans on poetic abstraction ("wreckage of her own mind") over embodied contradiction; salt-stiff hair and neoprene hood ground emotion, but "sorrow thawed one echo at a time" edges toward label-speak without sufficient struggle in the key exposure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (drowned "gave willingly"), but cost proof fails—no exact line shows visible sacrifice; "heartbeats thaw sorrow" implies cost yet remains abstract, missing the Q2 9+ requirement for legible price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacier shrine functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (breathing frost onto globe, candles writing paths); the warped snow globe evolves from drowned hull to salvaged snow sphere, charging the final star reflection with undeniable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (salvaging purity from mental wreckage) tighten when radioman spells her name, but "wreckage of her own mind" remains abstract—no concrete option foreclosed; cost is felt but not visibly dramatized in tactics during the exposure climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image of "snow that never stops falling" reweights the snow globe’s "permanent winter" into enduring hope without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by rooting "pure drift" in prior particulars (salvaged snow, brother’s jersey cameo).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("octaves of wreckage," "crepe-paper fish") shines, but high-pressure moments lack syntactic compression—uniformly lyrical phrasing during radioman’s signal ("spelling N-A-D-I-A") misses stress-induced diction shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Glowing dragons of wax, guardians of liminal script" creates mixed metaphor coherence issues; minor figurative muddle in mid-beat, but zero loops and propulsion remain strong through closure ("vanishes into snow that never stops").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes wreck-diving with dream-cameos uniquely (captain’s helmet on bread-buyer); risk-taking heightens stakes via lyric structure, but "borrowed starlight" trope slightly dilutes freshness despite glacier-specific transformation.</comment>
