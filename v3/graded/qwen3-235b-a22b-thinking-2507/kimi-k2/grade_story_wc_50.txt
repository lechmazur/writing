<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("neither happy nor sad") without embodied contradiction; "peripherally focused" trait stated but never shown altering choices under pressure, weakening the final filing decision's motivation despite clear external goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—the reverse-ticking timer crystallizes the cost of "safely filed" wonder against the empty cavern—but "cellar of reason" metaphor over-explained slightly diminishes the earned stasis's subtlety in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Marble cavern actively constrains choices: frost's advance threatens the mechanism, quartz veins enable the echo-harvest, and reflections dictate the entire reverse-engineering process, charging the final image of "mirrors waiting" with irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder before season ends) tighten via frost's creep and swallows' departure, but cost of failure remains abstract; pressure accumulates beautifully yet lacks visceral urgency about what's truly lost if the timer isn't fixed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: filing the girl's laugh in a tin box reweights "reverse-engineering wonder" into poignant preservation, with the final reverse-ticking echoes offering a resonant answer—safety requires suffocation—without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veins of quartz catching... like cracked glass") and rhythmic control under pressure ("gears bite reluctantly, as if tasting their own death") teach the lyric pattern early, paid off in the crystalline closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in early beats ("trembling reflections... harvest of echoes" proximity) slightly dilutes momentum, but zero loops and masterful final line ("mirrors waiting for the next locksmith") compensate with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes time/memory tropes through the concrete, non-obvious lens of "harvesting echoes" as threshing-floor labor, with the marble cavern's physics transforming abstraction into tactile stakes—risk-taking heightens without gimmickry.</comment>
