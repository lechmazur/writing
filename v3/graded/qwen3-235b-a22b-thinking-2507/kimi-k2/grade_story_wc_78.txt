<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in fear flickering yet continuing to dub, but emotional layering lacks depth during climax; micro-choices under pressure (adjusting tempo to whale clouds) reveal values, yet "restless euphony" abstraction weakens embodied emotion at critical moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: reef's transformation into marimba reconfigures the orchard from adrift to "conducted" with visible cost (exhaustion, physical reordering); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sound density escalates pressure toward earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard setting constrains choices (rotating toward reef via resonance) and charges final image ("lit from within"), but body/tool specificity falters; mallet's silk-wrapped head lacks tactile integration during pivotal strikes, slightly weakening micro-setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: prophet's dubbing transforms dissonant glass into harmony, foreclosing escape path with felt cost (physical/emotional strain); escalation driven by heartbeat-rhythm grooves reweights survival as artistic creation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "turn obstacles into instruments" motif, crystallized when limes strike glass marimba; avoids moralizing but final image's "conducted" orchard leans slightly toward tidy resolution, missing deeper complexity in the cost of perpetual adaptation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds as pages," "citrus mist as euphony") and rhythmic control peak during reef transformation; non-standard punctuation ("dub the pattern she saw overhead into the wood") taught early and paid off in closure's sonic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with zero loops, but "spiraled like nautilus shells. Each groove deepened by the fractal generating rhythm" contains paraphrase redundancy; figurative language avoids muddle yet "restless euphony" slightly drifts into abstraction during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical physics and survival creates inevitable emotional truth; risk-taking (orchard as instrument) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though floating-raft trope slightly echoes magical realism conventions without full transformation.</comment>
