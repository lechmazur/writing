<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rewriting papers vs burning them) drive credible endurance; micro-choices like balancing on atlases reveal value hierarchy. Backstory shift to cartographer lacks sufficient dramatization to fully earn the final admission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (burned papers, returned feather); Accumulative lens holds through dust motif density. Escalation slightly passive—the boy's letter relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains choices (stacking atlases to balance, stove for burning papers) and charges closure via dust storm projecting shadows. Cracked encyclopedia spines function as recurring object that mirrors fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust vs deception) deepens through paper trail destruction, but escalation leans on external catalyst (returned letter). Cost is unmistakable in burned documents yet lacks protagonist-driven tightening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust emerging from silence resonates through concrete particulars (meteorite chip, ash/dust spirals); final image reweights "blooming withering light" without moralizing. Child's drawing and returned feather deliver non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via deafness-filtered details ("dust motes swirl like notes," pigeons cooing in minor thirds"); rhythmic control modulates from lyrical to taut during crisis. Zero head-hopping, patterned elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High density with zero scaffold; "feathers snowed down among dust" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor synonym loop ("cracked" for spines/trust) but no closure impact. Final line's ash spirals achieve textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf violinist/pigeon trainer transforms tropes through meteorite-as-compass and dust-mote cartography. Emotional truth in "rusty but true" laughter avoids sentimentality; risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
