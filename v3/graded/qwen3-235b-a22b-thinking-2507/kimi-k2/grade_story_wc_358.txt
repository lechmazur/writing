<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (adapting stride, ribbon tests) shows contradictory impulses; Mara's fear of abandonment charges closure cost but lacks depth in secondary character motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (burst bulb, snapped ribbon) under Accumulative/Textural lens; "sphere inhale/exhale" mechanics make conceptual cost undeniable during containment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting constraining choice (doors opened/closed with tidal rhythm); silk ribbon charges final image by recording tremors, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through investigator's agency (practicing door rhythm) under Accumulative lens; cost of vigilance made legible when bulb bursts at low tide, narrowing options to one decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (patch resewing, ribbon physics) but final line's "foresight is a door" edges toward stated moral, slightly undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hazy precision," salt-stained concrete) persists under pressure; controlled rhythm in climax ("slammed the doors") avoids stress-induced syntax collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "metal lung" metaphor integrates cleanly with action during containment beat; final image ("containers aligned like letters") delivers high-density closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shipping logistics and quantum collapse feels inevitable; risk-taking (tides as reality's pulse) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "singular convergence" premise borders on familiar sci-fi tropes.</comment>
