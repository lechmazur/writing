<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s shift from solitary caching to immediate sharing of lullaby II, embodying "visibility travels in both directions" with embodied cost in her tear-blurred perception of the girl’s shaking shoulders; no diagnostic labels mar the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when Lira places the tape under the floorboard: the girl’s soundless crying crystallizes mutual visibility with felt cost ("felt the tears as if her own"), under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density (tape vibration, footsteps) reweights the stake without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library’s pipe chases function as micro-setting that constrains choice (crawling, caching in hollowed beams) and charges the final image—knothole placement of tape transforms the philosophy section into conduit for "You are not alone," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lira’s agency: her decision to break protocol and share lullaby II immediately (vs. saving for seven shards) narrows options with visible cost (emotional tremor, altered tactics), deepening under Accumulative lens as outage-induced vibrations heighten sensory pressure toward mutual recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tape’s physical journey—from personal relic to shared voice—avoiding moralizing; the final image of the girl hearing "You are not alone" reweights Lira’s opening motivation into a resonant answer about reciprocal visibility without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct (Lira notices textures like "rusty petals" of tape, "cobalt smears" of tears), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure ("counting heartbeats until the next uncertain flicker"); no head-hopping, and elision of the custodian’s fate taught early via "vanished the same winter."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("lighter than a moth wing yet heavy with sense memory" compresses emotional weight), with no figurative muddle—closure image ("shoulders shaking like pages in a draft") crystallizes cost through precise textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Risk-taking elevates stakes: transforming "ghost currents" from metaphor to tangible memory conduit feels inevitable through lived detail (pipe chases, felt seals), avoiding trope clichés while synthesizing homelessness and spectral tech into fresh emotional truth about visibility.</comment>
