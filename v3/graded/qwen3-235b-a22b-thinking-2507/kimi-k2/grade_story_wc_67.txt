<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "guilt and unfinished love," but motivation for ash-weaving ritual lacks concrete roots; "crystallize fleeting emotion" remains abstract without specific biographical anchors. Micro-choices like whispering "lies shaped like syrup" reveal value hierarchy yet flaws don't compound causally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise with legible cost in "tears welled... adding themselves to the scattering," under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens. Density intensification via ash-weaving reweights the "mirage of safety" stake, though curator's appearance slightly dilutes agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery actively constrains choice ("corridors became perspective vanishing into charcoal nothing"), while the mask as micro-setting charges closure through "light poured through shattered shards like mercy." Recurring ash constrains tactics and reweights the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's ash-weaving deepens the "mirage of safety" stake, with cost unmistakable in emotional crystallization ("raven set in amber"). Curator's coincidental presence complicates but doesn't resolve, though tightening could more viscerally narrow options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mirage of safety" motif without moralizing; final image ("memory could be both wound and suture") delivers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity through ash/mask duality, earning exceptional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ashy petals of what had once been her lover’s charcoal portrait") and rhythmic control under pressure elevate lyric compression. Purposeful elision taught early pays off in closure, with zero head-hopping despite fragmented time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Temples throb" typo ("temperatures" in draft) triggers -0.3 artifact penalty; otherwise high density with no closure-dulling muddle. Strategic figurative language ("powdery echoes") avoids loops, though "syrup" metaphor slightly strains coherence in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through gallery/mask specificity; "vanishing point" as emotional metaphor feels fresh. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional truth anchored in verifiable details like "six hundred possible futures."</comment>
