<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied emotion ("breath became pale ghosts") and micro-choices under pressure anchor interiority, but limited contradictory impulses during climax weaken the 9+ threshold; final renunciation earned through prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("felt her joints click into the grand mechanism"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup, with eclipse timing as persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen library actively constrains choice (frost-floor resonance, mirror navigation) and charges closure ("library closed its doors"); micro-setting (brass key fusing to skin) reweights the final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally escalate from personal (father's grief) to global (stuttering continents), driven by protagonist agency; cost crystallizes in transformation, unmistakable in "driftwood nostalgia" as the mechanism's price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rhythm of repair" motif without moralizing; final image reweights it as embodied cost ("heartbeat, steady, patient, eternal"), avoiding binaries while embracing complexity through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of iron and old paper") and rhythmic control peak in closure; lyrical elision taught early pays off in final "silver pools" reconfiguration without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density ("light folded into light") achieves propulsion without muddle; closure image pristine with "brass key fuse to her skin" avoiding figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "fixing time" trope through specific, irreplaceable details (god's tear gear, driftwood nostalgia); risk-taking heightens stakes while maintaining emotional truth and conceptual integrity.</comment>
