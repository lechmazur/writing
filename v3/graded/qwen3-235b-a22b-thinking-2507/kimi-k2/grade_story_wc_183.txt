<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "to stay was to forget; to leave was to lose her again," with embodied choices like clutching the card until it cuts the palm. Slight abstraction in "trapped freedom" concept prevents 9.0, but micro-choices reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: the emerald card crumbling as names scatter reconfigures "trapped freedom" into earned liminality. Accumulative escalation holds through density—threads to garden to engine room—without lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned ship functions as active constraint: melting clowns block paths, calliope chord enables climax, and roots-as-syllables charge the final image. Every detail serves urgency, like fog erasing names forcing the "Stay/Go" choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: "to stay was to forget; to leave was to lose her again." Escalation via protagonist agency—pulling threads, exhaling the chord—narrows options to one irreversible choice with visible cost (card crumbling, ship sinking).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "raft of syllables beneath my tongue" answers "garden of forgotten names" without moralizing. Final realization ("journey, not arrival") reweights prior material through the "half-alive" state, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "greens that never existed in nature" and "blissfully aberrant chord." Rhythm modulates perfectly—fragmented during climax ("I caught one: 'Stay.' But I chose the other: 'Go.'")—with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "piston pumping silence" compresses engine room tension. Figurative language stays coherent ("fog shaping itself into her silhouette"), with rhythm accelerating into the decisive exhale.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival ship as memory vessel transforms grief tropes. "Narrative threads" made literal through vines reconfigures naming stakes, with bold structural risk (accumulative escalation) heightening emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
