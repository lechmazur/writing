<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in cloud taxonomy (grief vs. guilt), but final career shift lacks visible cost; embodied emotion strong ("telescope felt heavier") though epiphany edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (spaces remember), Accumulative lens held through cloud observations; minor deduction as cost ("carried its quiet explosive truth") lacks concrete on-page manifestation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brass telescope functions as micro-setting—constrains choices (scanning clouds) and charges final image as "sacred relic"; sensory detail ("cool metal," "dusty starlight") evolves with emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Stakes deepen via cloud observations, but dominant pressure lacks visceral cost; "forty-seven signatures" feels arbitrary without tangible trade-off beyond career shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete cloud imprints ("altocumulus rippled with laughter"), but final line moralizes ("spaces we leave behind") risking thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cumulus gathered like mourners") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "spooled wholeness" exposition slightly disrupts voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful repetition ("dusty starlight"), but "quiet explosive moment" is label-speak; no fatal loops though "47 signatures" feels scaffolded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and emotional memory, though "clouds as archives" risks familiarity; specificity ("nimbostratus sagged with unshed tears") elevates beyond trope.</comment>
