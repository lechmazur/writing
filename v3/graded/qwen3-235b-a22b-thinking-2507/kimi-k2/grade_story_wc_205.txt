<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's mirror-covering ritual (avoiding past vs transcribing futures), but "poetically inclined toward elegy" tells rather than shows her shift; micro-choices like frantic draping during storms embody guilt without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Mara pressing the whole vase into Solenne's hands ("belongs to everyone") reconfigures ownership stakes, with visible cost in "sorrow transformed into burnished gold" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's mirrors constrain choices (covering them during storms) and charge the final image (reflecting constellations), while chronal dust storms evolve from torment to collaborators, perfectly mirroring internal shifts through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from artifact dispute to civilization reimagination under Accumulative pressure, but Company enforcers' conversion lacks escalation—they "found themselves listening" without prior friction, softening the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final poem etched into crystal ("gardeners of time") offers resonant non-literal answer to ownership question, avoiding moralizing through concrete action; "sorrow transformed into burnished gold" earns thematic weight via prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bruise-colored ribbon curling across glass" and refracted time; rhythmic control under pressure ("pen scratching against vellum as storms rattled") with consistent lyrical compression taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, high density ("music written in light, lovers exchanging memories like pressed flowers"), but "burnished with sorrow" slightly overwrought; no figurative muddle though closure beat remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological dispute as story-weaving rather than extraction; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes (vase healing via accumulated narratives) without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior refracted-time logic.</comment>
