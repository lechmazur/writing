<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: logical indexer compelled by folio's impossible compass rose, yet her final catalog rejects certainty. Micro-choices like pressing the stamp onto clay reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal vault entry, slightly muting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "tucked the stamp into her pocket" crystallizes rejection of digital certainty with conceptual cost ("overwrite doubt with certainty"). Accumulative lens holds through layered discoveries, but blackout's temporary constraint doesn't persistently shape tactics beyond forcing analog methods.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library functions as micro-setting: canal water alters light affecting stamp behavior, bronze vault doors require physical prying, and "dappled resolve" transforms from moonlight to dawn in final image. Water pressure literally constrains choices and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency: testing the stamp's rotation, descending to vault with marlinspike. Dominant stake (truth vs. certainty) tightens when blackout erases digital indices, forcing analog verification. Cost unmistakable as lights threaten to "overwrite doubt," but single pressure point limits escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "honest tremor of curiosity beneath settled ink" crystallizes without moralizing. Final catalog listing origins as hypotheses reweights truth-seeking as active process, answering the central question through action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive" shown through methodical actions ("fingers grazing spines"), not labels. Rhythmic control under pressure—long sentences for discovery, clipped phrasing during vault entry ("heart steady in reclaimed stillness")—avoids uniform tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sepia sequence told of architects who had built the library as a dry chamber inside the future lake" exemplifies high-density prose. Final line avoids cliché with "honest tremor of curiosity," but "copper gleam" slightly edges toward ornamental description in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through sunken-city mechanics: ink stamp as compass rose responding to iron bones feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric abstraction) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but "reclaimed stillness" recurrence lacks fresh inflection in middle development.</comment>
