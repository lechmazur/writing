<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "uncertainly certain" micro-choices, but Mara's weeping lacks earned emotional progression; Admiral's memory dump slightly over-explains stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: compass needle "never settling" crystallizes reweighted stakes with felt cost (Mara's reversed time), under Accumulative lens where "coincidence became pattern" tightens pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: compass rose physically tugs downward and fuses, while greenhouse ivy crawling "backward toward soil" constrains the descent path, charging the final "Perhaps" clock.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (fractured direction) escalates through 11:17 clocks tightening options; cost is visceral in Mara's backward-ticking grief, though coincidence slightly softens agency in the descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing via Admiral's "improvise with the void" note, but memory dump risks thematic echo; final image reweights uncertainty without stating morals, though "beneath the ashes" leans abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rusted gears," "leaves swirling") modulates rhythm under pressure, though cabin description slips into omniscient voice with "time had waited politely outside."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "compass rose spun lazily" uses filter verb in closure beat; "dry bones" simile pays off, yet "oil and regret" risks overwriting without sufficient pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via compass mechanics (needle pointing down) and backward-crawling ivy; emotional specificity in Mara's reversed grief elevates beyond magical realism clichés.</comment>
