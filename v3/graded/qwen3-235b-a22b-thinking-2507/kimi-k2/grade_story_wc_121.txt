<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in simultaneous impulses: retracing to land yet propelled by the wish that made her weightless. Final surrender of the tablet earns endurance with visceral cost ("gravity claiming her at last"). No therapy-speak; emotions embodied through concrete action like kneeling on the hospital marble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when gravity returns; "feet settle on the floor" crystallizes cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through procedural failure to final ripple. Orientation clear by word 10; cost proof in "gravity claiming her at last" forecloses the path of endless retracing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Viaduct functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: "to stop was to let labyrinth grow." Rain evolves from liquid light to mercury to ordinary rain, charging the final image. Hospital floor segment directly pressures the climax when she kneels, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tablet's map forces confrontation with childhood wish, narrowing options to surrender. Cost crystallizes when gravity returns as "rush of blood and memory," altering her state irrevocably. Pressure tightens through procedural failure ("looping cracked marble") under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "labyrinth is the hollow where your heart should be" shown via tablet destruction, not stated. Final ripple's "widening circle of now" reweights the premise without moralizing. Epiphany earned through the viaduct's collapse into her childhood room.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "runnels spelled warnings in liquid light," "laugh like glass breaking in reverse." Rhythm modulates under pressure—staccato during procedural failure, lyrical at surrender. Zero head-hopping; compression during crisis ("She knelt") heightens stakes without muddle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "puddle" reprise crystallizes closure without muddle. Every sentence does double duty (e.g., "rain falling upward" establishes setting and internal state). Figurative language precise even under pressure ("glass breaking in reverse"); final line recharges the opening drop/ripple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Gravity defier" transformed through specific emotional stakes: flight ability born from fractured timelines, not generic power. Procedural generation of regret-made architecture feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens the cost of surrender without gimmickry.</comment>
