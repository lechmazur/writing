<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Zev's raw-palmed memory wars with present precision; embodied flaw ("lungs burned") compounds choice. Final reweaving earns covenant endurance with visceral cost in "palms how ropes must feel." No stock phrasing—only character-particular sensory logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "arbor holds him in absolute stillness" crystallizes covenant endurance with felt cost (vanished rookie, cracked buckle). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via atmospheric shear whispers narrowing options. Orientation flawless by line 3; cost proof in "palms how ropes must feel."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Living pulley and parachute buckle constrain every choice—webbing revision alters tactics under shear risk. Final image ("steps no louder than stars") recharges resin scent with conceptual cost. Micro-setting mastery: moon-blessed plank, lavender-gray web, and buckle cracks charge closure beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cracked buckle (immediate death risk) to atmospheric shear (operation-wide peril), but deepening lacks visible price paid mid-scene. Agency shines in reweaving, yet pressure tightens too abstractly—shear whispers don’t concretely narrow options until closure. Dominant stake (trust as weight) holds firm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "thousand silent knots" motif—no moralizing, only earned resonance. Final image reweights "trust lighter than carbon fiber" into visceral cost: covenant endures via palms reading ropes, not words. Avoids binaries; complexity lives in Zev’s endurance amid guilt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: Zev notices "buckle tongues glinting," "resin crack," and "living rope" torque—professional bias woven into rhythm. Lyric compression taught early ("soundless echo") pays off in star-quiet steps. Zero head-hopping; stress shortens syntax without breaking voice ("diagrams... across eyelids").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line propulsion flawless—"threads through arbor’s living pulley" merges action/image. But "failure to note flaw tomorrow..." paraphrase-loop with next sentence costs 0.2. Figurative language sparse in peak beats; "soundless echo" motif avoids overuse. Final line’s cadence shift ("steps... no noise than stars") elevates closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms military trope via organic constraints: living-wood platform demands "gentler torque," parachute webbing becomes "lavender-gray" art. Risk-taking heightens stakes—no dialogue, yet trust crystallizes through buckle revisions. Fresh inflection: "trust as thousand silent knots" feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
