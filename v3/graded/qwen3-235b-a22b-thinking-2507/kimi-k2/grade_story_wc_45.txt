<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy’s contradictory impulses—skepticism bending "like light through old glass" while pocketing the tooth—act simultaneously under pressure. Final choice (humming lullaby to knit bones into light) is earned through prior bone-setting micro-choices with visible cost: the skeleton dissolving into constellations reconfigures her guilt into guidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the skeleton’s transformation into a "constellation labeled in a language that tasted like forgiveness" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds perfectly—each beat (tooth pulse → skeleton revelation → ritual) tightens options without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The changeling’s tooth functions as micro-setting: it constrains Ivy’s ritual choice (pressing it into the skeleton’s hand) and charges the final image when opalescent. Specificity shines in tactile details like "surgical steel tweezers" used on foxes, which later anchor the bone-setting ritual’s emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally escalate from abstract doubt ("cleft in certainty") to concrete action: Ivy’s agency in initiating the ritual forecloses skepticism when she presses the tooth into the skeleton’s hand. The irreversible cost—the human child’s death made literal via the cleft palate—is felt in the dissolving bones and the girl’s tears catching starlight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "turning mistakes into constellations" crystallizes when the skeleton knits into light, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The opalescent tooth handed back—"being borrowed doesn’t mean being broken"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that embraces complexity while rejecting simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Ivy notices "roses in colors no nursery catalogued" through her vet’s pragmatic lens ("same tweezers used on foxes"). Rhythmic control under pressure—long lyrical sentences during revelation, clipped actions during ritual—avoids head-hopping while compressing time via taught patterns ("dawn... twilight").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("milk-white and sharp as a star" conveys tooth’s unnaturalness and emotional weight). Strategic telling compresses backstory ("last autumn a wild-eyed girl...") without dulling closure. Final line’s "nostalgic scent of bruised roses" recharges opening sensory detail with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope via specific emotional calculus: magic "meant to heal, not replace" reframes the girl’s guilt as borrowed identity. The cleft palate detail makes universal truth visceral. Risk-taking (bone-setting as ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight when bones "knit into light."</comment>
