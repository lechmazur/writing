<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finch’s motivation (serenading monotony via ordered randomness) is concrete and action-driven, with micro-choices like marble release revealing hierarchy of values. Lacks visible internal contradiction—competence borders on infallibility, muting stakes. Final renunciation (walking away) earns closure but cost is externalized to bystanders, not felt personally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the violet halo crystallizes options with undeniable pressure as sailors reconcile and old man recalls song. Cost is legible in altered human connections ("sailors laughed at absurdity of quarrel"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred by midpoint via density of orchestrated details, held flawlessly through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal arcade constrains every choice: Finch measures slopes at dawn, marbles follow imperceptible gradients, and starlight refracting through syrup creates the halo. Final image (lingering violet footprint) charges closure by merging setting with theme. Environment isn’t backdrop but active tactical resource, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (can chaos be "politely asked to dance?") tighten when marbles collide into the triangle—a single meaningful deepening narrowing options. Agency is pure Finch: his calculations force the serendipity. Cost is unmistakable in bystanders’ transformed interactions, though personal stakes for Finch remain oblique, slightly muting escalation’s visceral punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: marbles merging paths, ribbon placement as predictable hunger, not chance. Final image (violet halo) reweights "calculated wilderness" without moralizing—it shows order/chaos coexisting. No thematic echo; epiphany is earned via spilled syrup and refracted light, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is Finch’s analytical precision: noticing "kerosene on chin," "dripping snow-cone," and tide-table-derived melody. Voice modulates under pressure—juggling sequence uses clipped rhythms ("soft slap of water against glass")—yet remains consistent. No head-hopping; distance control impeccable despite multi-character moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with specificity ("wet marble," "captive fireflies") but risks overwriting in high-pressure beats: "calculated wilderness where chance and design blurred" slightly muddles immediacy. No loops or scaffold, yet final truncated "metron" feels like artifact, dulling closure’s rhythm. Density remains purposeful, avoiding synonym churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms street performer trope via "orchestrated serendipity" grounded in tide tables and carpenter’s level. Emotional truth in Finch’s quiet control avoids quirkiness; the bishop’s coordinates leading to moonflowers feels inevitable. Risks lyrical density without gimmickry, though premise’s freshness hinges on execution over radical novelty.</comment>
