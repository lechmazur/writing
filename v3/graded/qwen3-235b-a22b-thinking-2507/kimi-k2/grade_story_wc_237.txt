<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines through crystallizing scars as contradictory impulses (fear/strength), but the quill-tapping superstition feels slightly unearned in micro-choice hierarchy without deeper prior establishment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("lungs burned; held breath felt like molten glass"), though Master Tenju's off-page instruction slightly muddies the accumulative lens at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea platform and crow quill function as micro-setting that constrains choices (quill-dipping, tapping ritual) and charges the final image of Lira tucking it behind her ear as the rock rises.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through breath-as-clock ("lungs burned; held breath felt like molten glass"), but the "rock plummeting" threat remains abstract without concrete escalation beyond Lira's internal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through scars-to-stories transformation, though "scars can choose to become stories" risks near-explicit statement but is redeemed by the teardrop-feather rune's final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("saturated hush that pressed against the ears like deep water") and rhythmic control under pressure, with intentional elision of Master Tenju taught early and paid off in thematic weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "saturated hush" repetition functions as patterned motif, though "crystallized scars" phrasing risks slight echo in high-pressure beats without sufficient variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bodily trauma as crystalline scars transforms familiar rune magic tropes, but the "held breath" storm frame leans slightly on established mythic structures without radical reinvention.</comment>
