<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lucien's complicity in propaganda creates authentic interior conflict; secondary characters lack distinct flaws but their embodied reactions (tears, recorder clicks) show earned stakes under pressure without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: audience adding lines reconfigures storytelling's purpose with visible cost (pilot's tears, singer's ash butterflies); Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Decommissioned radar dome actively constrains choices: curved walls project puppets, residual electronics activate the stick; final projection onto dome charges closure with environmental specificity that shapes the entire performance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation through Lucien's agency as puppets transform "truth is loudest scream" into a question; cost is unmistakable in pilot's tears and data-runner's unbidden recorder click during the tyrant's reversal beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (rewriting sparks into fireflies) not moralizing; final image of projected performance offers non-literal answer to "ethical storytelling" without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("meteor hush," "mascara streaked like comet tails") reflects Lucien's calligrapher eye; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to urgent during puppet scenes without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ozone scent," "grime on cheeks" exemplify textural specificity; sentence rhythm accelerates during reversal beat ("syllables sucked into its mouth like smoke") without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ethical storytelling" via calligraphic puppets and radar dome; tyrant's mirror-script speech transforms the trope through specific mechanics that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
