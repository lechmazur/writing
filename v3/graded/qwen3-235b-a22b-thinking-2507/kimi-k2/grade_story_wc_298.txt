<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("exits where entrances should be") and embodied emotion ("sap beaded like blood") compellingly drive the barter choice; recklessness flaw compounds authentically but village fire reflection slightly overextends BRR limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis via visible cost ("tree drank another tomorrow she would never live") under Accumulative lens; pressure deepens through sensory density shift as roots tighten, reconfiguring "tower" into salvation bud without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choice (sapling splitting pelvis, roots tightening bones) and charges final image with inverted tower bud; every sensory detail reflects Lira's urgency ("bruised apples," "sap beaded like blood").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as Lira escalates barter from abstract ("patch holes") to visceral self-sacrifice ("feed them mine"), with cost unmistakable in heartbeat-by-heartbeat forfeiture of tomorrows under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete barter mechanics and the inverted tower bud's resonant reconfiguration; avoids moralizing while offering non-literal answer to repair-through-loss without thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised apples," "bones clacking like wind chimes") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("roots cradling the bone as fiercely gentle as a mother who knows the child will never wake") multiplies meaning without muddle; final line’s translucent fruit seeds crystallize closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard as living wound-repair system feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming tarot trope through bone-knitting roots.</comment>
