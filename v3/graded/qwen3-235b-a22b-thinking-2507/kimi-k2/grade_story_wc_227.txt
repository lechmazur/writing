<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "uncertain alchemist" archetype—fear versus duty embodied through ritual submersion and gold-quilting. Final choice to continue earns closure via prior causality (statue's approval triggering transformation). No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion in "caustic tide scour doubt from my tongue" avoids cliché. Minor over-tidiness in emotional progression slightly softens stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—"meaning demands a keeper"—under Accumulative lens. Workshop shudder and statue's dissolution crystallize irreversible stakes. No orientation debt; lens taught by "quilting memories" motif. Minor repetition in "break, mend" cadence doesn't dilute cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Key ring charm constrains every choice—mending scars alters workshop's fate—and charges closure as furnace fuel. Acid sea's sensory immediacy (hissing, green fire) evolves causally with events. "Porcelain charm clicks into hollow wrist" exemplifies micro-setting as pivotal constraint. No generic placeholder; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"conjuring meaning from oblivion"—tightens via protagonist agency: narrating scars accelerates pressure as workshop shudders. Sixth crater triggers irreversible cost: statue dissolves, leaving narrator "keeper" with "quilt unfinished." Cost unmistakable in "dire enchantment deepens" amid golden seams. No coincidence; escalation pure Accumulative density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: kintsugi becomes literal memory-fuel, not abstract philosophy. Final "break, mend" mantra reweights premise with conceptual cost—breaks must "shine brighter than whole." No thematic echo; statue's dissolution offers non-literal answer to "meaning is re-membered." Earned wisdom avoids sentimentality through acid-scoured specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct—"voice threading clatter of ratchets," "taste of every story"—with rhythm modulating underwater dips. Purposeful elision ("between breaths held") taught early and paid in closure's "breathless plunge." No head-hopping; stress compression ("counting heartbeats") heightens pressure. Slight register drift in "dire enchantment" doesn't fracture voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; every line propels narrative—"gold in my veins flows out like luminous thread" compresses backstory and action. No figurative muddle in peak beats; "milky but seeing" eyes crystallize transformation. Minor density in "caustic tide scour doubt" risks overwriting but earns payoff. Final "break, mend" cadence avoids drumbeat through conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: floating workshop on acid sea transforms kintsugi into survival mechanic, avoiding trope. Emotional specificity in "uncertain alchemist" grounds universal stakes—"traded for vial of silence that did not work" reveals flawed humanity. Risk-taking heightens coherence: Accumulative structure lands closure without causal turns. Near-echo of mythic archetypes transformed through mercury-from-tears materiality.</comment>
