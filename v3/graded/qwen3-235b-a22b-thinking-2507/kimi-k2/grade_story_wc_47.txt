<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (filed rose thorns, whispered "not to erase but to grow over"), but "protected vulnerability" risks therapy-speak without the bird-rib simile's embodiment. Final grafting action earns credible endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the drip-pattern "forgive" hologram reconfigures memory with conceptual cost ("data can become mercy"). Accumulative lens holds throughout with drip patterns tightening pressure toward earned stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moss garden constrains every choice—kneeling on pulsing moss, grafting into salt-crusted ports—and charges the final image ("moss-cooled aisles murmuring with leaf and root"). Micro-setting (drip patterns) directly shapes the "forgive" revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when the pendant's hologram refracts lost conversation into drip-patterned "forgive," transforming passive search into active grafting. Conceptual cost (trading viral spectacle for organic hope) is unmistakable in the rose petal resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete grafting: "data can become mercy" avoids moralizing by embedding in the rose petal. Final image reweights "honeyed hush" from childhood memory to active reconciliation, though "protected vulnerability" slightly echoes prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Perceptual signature is impeccable—Lira notices only what serves her grief (drip patterns, warm metal hum). Rhythmic control peaks in the icicle "syllable in the long sentence of thaw," compressing time without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "amber flared, projecting... fragments refracted through resin" achieves high density. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near closure barely avoids artifact penalty but caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms data-center tropes through mycelial logic: servers don't "die" but "dream still," grief becomes "chlorophyll." Risk-taking (hologram code as drip patterns) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
