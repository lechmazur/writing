<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concretely embodied in frost-reading and shard-handling; final renunciation earned through mentor's "follow the pause" motif. Slight thematic echo in "purpose hides in pauses" edges toward abstraction but stays anchored in physical action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure: tears blurring projected ledger while refusing to look away crystallizes remembrance-over-vengeance with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds through frost-to-light progression; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon actively constrains choices—frost feathers guide movement, obsidian shards form trail, kiln remains supply closure image. Micro-setting (frost lattice) charges final projection; environment integral to tactics and payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through physical evidence: ledger → frost patterns → obsidian trail → kiln discovery. Agency-driven deepening when shard placement reveals truth; visible cost in tears blurring the image yet enduring the sight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mentor's "three lines, pause, two lines" pattern reweights into "pauses speak louder than strikes." Avoids moralizing; final image answers "purpose" through resonant light lattice, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices glass refractions, frost angles, and breath in cold. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("sound like distant applause") to urgent ("knees stiff"). Minor register drift in repeated "steadily adaptive" label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with purposeful imagery ("dark mirrors that reflected her silhouette—fragile, bright, unfinished") but minor scaffold in "steadily adaptive" repetition. Final deduction for "drifting resonance" near-synonym loop in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glass artist reading frost as map transforms revenge trope. Specific verifiable detail (obsidian reflecting fragmented face) avoids quirkiness. Transformation test fails only if removing glass medium; otherwise irreplaceable.</comment>
