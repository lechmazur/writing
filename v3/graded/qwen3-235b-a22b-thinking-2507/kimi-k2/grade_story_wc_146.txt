<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Flawless embodiment of "infinitely patient" via footfall rhythm; micro-choices in stride adjustment show value hierarchy. Lacks interior contradiction but earns endurance through concrete pressure. No interiority limits higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "balance restored" and departing tuner crystallize the wild hush. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; mortar dust exhaling as visible cost anchors the Resonant Reconfiguration. One hairline slip: ghost feet "silent yet in time" strains physics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobblestones function as micro-setting that charges closure—cracks closing "like lips after a secret" and later polished to "low sheen" constrain the tuner's rhythm and reconfigure the final image. Sensory hierarchy masterfully filtered through his tactile focus on sound and stone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring shared balance) tightens through the procession's evolving rhythm; cost legible in the dog's "ribs like harp strings" and the bell's autonomous ring. Escalation driven by tuner's agency via footfall adjustments, though the ghost integration slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of the bell ringing "like dawn" reweights the "wild hush" with conceptual cost—memory made tangible without moralizing. Theme emerges purely from cobblestone rhythms and breath-like dust; avoids thematic echo despite the hummed resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sound-focused syntax ("Tap, rest, tap-tap") mirrors the tuner's profession. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless; "wind forgets its own name" establishes lyrical compression paid off in the archway's lullaby. Zero head-hopping despite multiple focal points.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mortar dust drifted like breath exhaled" exemplifies high-density propulsion. "Fur matted with neglect" borders on label-speak but saved by concrete context. Final line’s "rolled down the street like dawn" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival transformed through rhythmic specificity—footsteps as heartbeat rebuilds community. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "ebony fork" risks trope without the "tasted of rain and cedar" sensory reweighting. Fresh synthesis of sound physics and memory.</comment>
