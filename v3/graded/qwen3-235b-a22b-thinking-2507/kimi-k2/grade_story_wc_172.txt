<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in pivotal micro-choice: setting the egg while calculating "one gesture of restoration against the fortune." Embodied emotion avoids labels ("heart hammering with an emotion she refused to name") with visible cost scaling to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: walking away as rain falls, empire crumbling. Cost legible in "strange grace of a gift that cost her everything." Accumulative lens holds through salt flat's harmonic response to the egg's note, reweighting stakes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Salt flat constrains every choice: cracks guide egg placement, dissolving crystals enable river's return. Final image of "whitening crust" under rain charges closure. Micro-setting (feather-shaped salt) directly alters tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake tightening via agency: pouring river water as "betrayal of empire" forecloses profit path. Cost crystallizes when she doesn't command orbital mirrors to stop rain. Single deepening suffices, with drought's reversal earned through her actions, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fractured grace" embodied in split-mouth reflection, cracking egg, indigo-gold feather. Final image reweights "amoral philanthropy" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "thunder... a taunt from the sky" and "dust that smelled faintly of wet reeds." Rhythmic control accelerates during egg's cracking ("A hairline fracture appeared...") then breathes with lyrical closure. Zero register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "mottled shell to her ear" does triple duty (character/setting/theme). Final fragment "fractured grace sharp" taught through prior "fractured" motifs. Zero figurative muddle in high-pressure beats like the egg's shuddering.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms eco-fiction tropes through specific moral calculus: amoral philanthropy weaponizing drought for profit, yet broken by sentimentality. "Map drawn by cracks" device feels inevitable, not checklist. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
