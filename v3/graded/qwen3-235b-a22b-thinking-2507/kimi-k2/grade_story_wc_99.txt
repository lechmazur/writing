<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks sufficient simultaneous tension; the "unspoken sigh" echoes but micro-choices like sealing the lace box don't actively wrestle with competing impulses. Strength lies in embodied regret through lace/compass handling, yet the final renunciation feels resolved without visible internal struggle at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: bonsai shifting from "anchors tethered in shallow pots of regret" to "ships pointing toward the open sea" crystallizes the emotional price of acceptance. Accumulative lens holds through lace-mist pattern density, though the compass’s passive guidance slightly weakens protagonist agency in the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The compass constrains choice by directing Helini’s ritual ("tucked beneath her tongue, felt its cold point whispering left"), charging the final image where it aligns her breathing with "water returning to stone." Micro-setting (lace, moss-lined box) actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure as the mist’s instructions ("gather sky after you have left it untouched") reweight Helini’s options, but her passive reception of the lace’s guidance ("instructions appeared") undercuts protagonist-driven escalation. Cost is felt in the bonsai’s transformation, yet the ritual’s mechanics rely on atmospheric inevitability over active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lace’s evolving symbolism—holes forming "letters no brush ever traced" become the vessel for "apology catching moonlight"—avoiding moralizing. The final image ("fade to quiet dawn") resonates as a non-literal answer to "how would we paint memory open again?" without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-driven diction ("vowels lingering like still dew," "resin of creased fingers"), with rhythm modulating under pressure. The Accumulative lens justifies the mist’s indirection, though a single line ("the separation as rhythmically placid") risks abstract description without embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean" shifts meaning from mist shade to regret tone without muddle. Propulsion excels in sparse, multi-jobbing lines ("She set the compass on lace coordinates that mapped regrets to scars"), though "rhythmically placid" repetition borders on ornamental in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms apology into tactile color theory via lace and compass, avoiding tropes through specific mechanics ("skip three airs, let the color of withheld kindness bloom"). The bonsai-as-ships metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric compression) heightening stakes without obscuring the closure’s quiet charge.</comment>
