<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "mildly obsessed" is labeled not embodied. Final renunciation (tearing sleeve) earns closure but motivation remains singularly focused without internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the obsidian mirror vision reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (sleeve sacrifice, star's death). Accumulative lens holds through density of silences, though lens clarity arrives slightly past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet constrains every choice—its physicality (gilt edges, blank pages) directly shapes the map's creation and charges the final glowing image. Sensory details are purposefully woven into action under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by oracle's accumulating silences under Accumulative lens, with clear cost (sleeve, star's death). Stakes tighten via the dimming star, but protagonist agency in deepening pressure feels passive rather than active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the map's evolution; the traveler's vision offers resonant, non-literal answer to "guiding after the last star died" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete image work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("marbled hush," "topographical curves of quiet") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early ("retell of earlier silences") pays off in closure's obsidian mirror vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gilt edges trembling in rhythm with her mildly obsessed heartbeat" shows textural density without muddle. Final truncated phrase ("folding itself into") intentionally charges closure without obscuring cause.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope through specific silence-cartography; emotional truth in mapping "what could not be said" avoids abstraction. Fresh synthesis of silence-as-landscape feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
