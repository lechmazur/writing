<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brightly attentive eyes hunting for something the law never imagined" versus corporate duty; embodied emotion peaks when heart beats "117, 117, 117" as servers hum. Final renunciation of corporate identity earned through prior causality with visible cost in carrying the patch like a locket.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable cost: "the patch warm against her palm" as decommissioning looms. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—density increase in 117 recurrences narrows options, with cost legible in "overwritten by ads for sleep aids" and the silent archive flicker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting as constraint: server rack 117 and patch metallic threads directly alter tactics (storing star charts in jewelry), charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy excels—"silence that tasted of sensed absence" filters through Mara’s grief without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency under Accumulative lens: numbers 117 accumulate pressure until "heart beat the same rhythm as the servers," narrowing options to lie or lose the crew. Cost unmistakable in "overwritten by ads for sleep aids," charging the decommission deadline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "not about bodies but about memory itself," with final image ("wherever Leo was, he was still singing") offering resonant non-literal answer to "where deleted files go." No moralizing—conceptual cost of erased longing reweights the premise without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "archive hummed like a hive whose queen had vanished" reflects Mara’s grief-tinted tech lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in fragmented climax ("She copied... uploaded... walked out"), though minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; high density in "pixel dimensions of a corrupted image, again in the temperature readout" advances plot. Minor paraphrase loop ("again... again...") in number recurrence avoids scaffold penalty by pattern-teaching, but "felt like breadcrumbs" slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "corporate memory keeper" trope through specific tech-poetic synthesis (storing star charts in patch threads). Risk-taking heightens stakes—lyric compression of "0117 hours" as decommission deadline makes digital afterlife emotionally specific without gimmickry.</comment>
