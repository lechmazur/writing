<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "quantifying absence" as embodied action, not summary; vendor’s transformation to listener earns cost through "grief unborn" labeling. Slight abstraction in peak moments slightly weakens concrete embodiment of forgiveness’s weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "compass needle glints with bottled moonlight borrowed from zero" crystallizes conceptual cost of absence. Accumulative lens holds tightly; "quantifying absence" drives escalation without causal breaks. Minor deduction for cost being conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard directly constrains choices: bottle reshapes into keyhole via counted voids, floating above clouds after lanterns lit. Final image of "fractal aisles printing FORGIVE" charges closure through setting’s evolution. Micro-setting (bottle) is indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through vendor’s agency: "quantifying absence" narrows options by reshaping bottle, culminating in "incise" act. Cost is undeniable—"becoming listener" forecloses vendor identity as lanterns lift building. Escalation flawless under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "distance between lost and found is quantifiable only by what is missing" reweights premise without moralizing. Final compass image resonates as non-literal answer to "forgive the beginning," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fifteen threads missing, eighteen shadows impossible") and rhythmic control peak during incising surface—"no blood, just shimmer of alphabetic filament." Zero head-hopping; elisions (judge reference) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver vapors not inside the bottle" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "newborn quiet" avoids figurative muddle. Deduct 0.2 for slight overwriting in "veined lattice of leaves also made of glass" without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "bottled moonlight" as narrative seed transforms tropes through specific mechanics (counting absences). Emotional truth in "grief unborn" avoids generality; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
