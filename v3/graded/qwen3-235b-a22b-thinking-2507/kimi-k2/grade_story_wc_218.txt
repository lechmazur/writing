<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("foster interspecies respect strong enough to outlast her pulse") manifests through embodied choices like synchronizing heartbeat with sap flow, avoiding therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (weakening body vs deepening calm) drive her final renunciation, with ashes traveling the circuitry crystallizing visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "moonflowers opened on cue, silver petals trembling to the hush of her last breath" reconfigures the temple's purpose while making mortality legible. Accumulative lens holds—each architectural secret deepens pressure without causal breaks, culminating in the island-as-sanctuary realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The copper wires function as micro-setting that constrains choices (guiding sap vectors) and charges the final image (ashes traveling circuitry). Mineral spring feeding roots/her cistern directly shapes the closure act, satisfying the 9+ gate by making environment inseparable from Mara's legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency: discovering the fossilized heartwood core (secret #2) deepens her approach from grafting to seismic integration, narrowing options as her body weakens. Cost is unmistakable in "brazen calm deepening as her body weakened" and the final synchronization with her last breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "Respect is not taught but transmitted, like sap, like calcium, like song" arises from concrete particulars (snail ramps, whale-song hollows), avoiding moralizing. Final image of pillars "already growing the next room" reweights the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in how Mara notices "copper-warmed stones" for iguanas and "tuned hollows" for bees. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the closure beat: "pressed it into the hollow... moonflowers opened on cue" compresses diction while maintaining voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances multiple elements (e.g., "iguanas sunned themselves on copper-warmed stones" establishes setting/action/theme). Near-flawless propulsion, though "brazen calm" repetition (3x) slightly dilutes momentum in high-pressure beats, costing 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "dying caretaker" trope through specific, grounded choices: limestone-banyan grafting feels scientifically plausible, whale-song resonance in hollow trunks avoids quirkiness. Emotional truth in her quiet renunciation ("anchored the last wire") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
