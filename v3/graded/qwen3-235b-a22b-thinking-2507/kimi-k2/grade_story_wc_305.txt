<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira's "hollow echo" versus oath-driven action; embodied emotions like tasting "iron and salt" avoid therapy-speak. Sister's sudden appearance lacks setup but final choice ("tending is mine") earns endurance with visible cost in ash-soiled hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "green shoots pushed through ash" reconfigures rebirth with undeniable conceptual cost ("needed caretakers more than heroes"). Accumulative lens holds through scalloped mist/petals density, culminating in hairpin's transformation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cloud-oak's pulsing bark and hairpin function as micro-setting that constrains choice (climbing releases memories) and charges closure (glinting as "thousand tiny suns"). Sensory specificity like "petals tasted of merlot" avoids white-room syndrome while serving rebirth theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: her climb escalates to mother's ghost reframing contentment as "recognizing the cycle," with visible cost in ash-choked roots and sister's "shock of rebirth." One deepening suffices for Accumulative lens, foreclosing isolation via "the tending is mine" choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete rebirth imagery (hairpin→trellis→grapes) without moralizing; final image ("rhythm of footsteps between rows") answers "source of contentment" non-literally. Avoids sentimentality by embracing complexity: "cycle needed caretakers more than heroes" carries conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence tasted of crushed grapes") modulates with pressure; ghost dialogue carries subtext through vineyard hush rhythm. Elision of sister's arrival is taught by Lira's focus on internal state, avoiding head-hopping while maintaining psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm to mirror climbing ("Each branch... released soft scallop of mist"). High density in lines like "hush between heartbeats" charges closure without figurative muddle. Final image recharges motifs with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms forgiveness trope: contentment as "gentle weight of responsibility" via vineyard-specific tending. Emotional truth in sister's weeping over "petal to tongue" avoids generic redemption; cloud-oak mythos feels singular, not derivative.</comment>
