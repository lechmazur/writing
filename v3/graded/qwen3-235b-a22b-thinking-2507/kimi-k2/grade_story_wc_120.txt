<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through mapping urgency vs. exhaustion; embodied emotion in "metal and pine" memory taste. Micro-choices like rotating the shell for dawn light reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to lower the shell is earned through accumulated sensory anchors, though the eight-year-old's sudden comprehension lacks prior friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: exhaustion touching her as she surrenders the shell. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through density of mapped memories (sneakers, glue, thunder) culminating in the lake cracking. The "single spiraling dawn" reconfigures options with conceptual cost, though the transition to childhood feels slightly unearned by prior mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The nautilus shell constrains every choice: mapping memories to whorls dictates her tactics, and its warmth/glow charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("scent of library glue," "squeak of new sneakers") filters through her composer-father legacy. The glass spire’s transparency revealing the ice staff directly enables the symphony release, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conducting unheard symphonies) tightens through her escalating mapping under dawn’s approach. Agency drives escalation: placing memories at precise whorls (2.7, 4.1, 5.9) narrows options as exhaustion looms. Cost is legible in "exhaustion finally touching her" at the climax, though the mirrored horizon’s role in enabling the resolution slightly edges on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "music is only time folded small enough to hold" gains weight when the shell conducts fragmented memories. The final image reweights the premise—unheard symphonies aren’t trapped but shared—without stating a moral. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "childhood contained unheard symphonies" in creaking swings and dandelion pops.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: memories manifest as sensory fragments ("tasted of metal and pine"), and syntax mirrors pressure with staccato beats during mapping ("sneakers squeaked, glue breathed"). Rhythmic control under stress shines in the symphony release’s cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks to the shell’s grooves as exhaustion hits.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; every line advances atmosphere or character (e.g., "ink distilled from auroras" conveys her alchemy). Figurative language ("frozen exclamation," "upturned hush") remains coherent and purpose-driven. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing near closure, but density and propulsion stay impeccable through the symphony climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "fortune cookie writer" trope through the nautilus-shell conductor metaphor. Emotional truth anchors the fantastical: mapping childhood sounds onto spiral grooves feels inevitable. The "upturned hush" reconfiguration—silence louder than applause—is a fresh inflection growing from established motifs. Avoids abstraction by tying universals to "gym varnish squeak" and "icicle baton."</comment>
