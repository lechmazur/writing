<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in heartbeat synchronization—fear tightening throat yet quickening rhythm as fuel. Embodied emotion avoids labels; micro-choices (mirroring mother’s gesture) earn closure’s cost. Final endurance as "fierce grammar" crystallizes stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: garden’s dissolution into vacant lot ("a single petal... winked out") charges cost visibly. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks via heartbeat-petal rhythm narrowing options to translation. Cost proof undeniable in Mara stepping "across the threshold" carrying archive alone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Velvet garden actively constrains choices: petals become letters, paths rearrange under pressure. Final image of "vacant lot ringed with chain-link fence" recharges setting’s cost. Micro-setting (shell/lectern spiral) directly shapes climax, fulfilling 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: heartbeat synchronization deepens pressure, narrowing options to one rhythm. Cost legible as garden’s physical collapse ("vacant lot") while internal archive persists. Single escalation (resonance method) suffices, reweighting "isolation into independence" with felt loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "forgetting and remembering were partners" crystallizes non-literal answer to memory’s cost. Avoids moralizing; final image ("writing new memories") reweights quarantine without abstraction. Subtext in shell’s shift from plea to "translated" wisdom feels earned, not imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "resonance structures folding space like paper" filters physics through emotional need. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, urgent beats during synchronization ("Mara did not stop... quickened it"). Zero head-hopping; voice sustains lyrical compression without obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "petals fell upward, dissolving into the bruised sky" avoids scaffold. Minor figurative muddle ("lattices of sound") in one beat, but no loops or closure artifacts. Final line’s "fierce grammar of independence" recharges opening motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine trope via neural soil/garden mechanics—specificity ("resonance structures," heartbeat matching) avoids genericness. Risk-taking (lyric escalation over causal turns) heightens emotional stakes coherently. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable: "translation" reframes isolation as ground, not void.</comment>
