<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize in Lumen's choice to contain rather than flee fire; "heat still scalded" risks label-speak but embodied cost in powering down salvages motivation. Final log entry shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Lumen powers down "into quiet listening," reconfiguring stakes through "roots drinking from ashes." Magnetic shift anchors orientation by word 30; cost is undeniable in the sacrificed static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Irrigation trough constrains choice when fears dissolve to alter tactics; compass roses etched in floor charge the climax. "Glass fogged with condensed memory" transforms micro-setting into thematic engine without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single stake (containment vs escape) tightens through Lumen's agency: "evacuation was not resolution." 43-minute countdown forces trade-off with visible cost in powering down; escalation driven purely by protagonist choice under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final "sanctuary of fragmented wholeness" reweights "miniaturized chaos" without moralizing. Farmer's daughter's "warm sand" line gains devastating resonance when flame "did not burn him"—earned subtext replaces thematic statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Android POV shapes every detail: "petals color of dried blood brushing organic fingertips." Rhythm shifts from "restless hum" to urgent countdown; no filter verbs, pure embodied observation even under fire.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"Crisped, fell, regrew" triplet shows masterful propulsion; zero loops. Slight abstraction in "static organize into single note" risks muddle but "struck bell" grounds it—peak beats retain crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes through specific physics: magnetic shift affecting androids, roses exhaling static. "Fears fit in palm yet heat scalded" achieves emotional specificity no template could replicate—freshness rooted in lived detail.</comment>
