<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Kael-2’s drawn blade yielding to surrender, embodying numbness without labels. Micro-choices like forehead-to-mat reveal values under pressure, though clone’s initial flatness slightly weakens status dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "tears return, salt stinging like thaw" crystallizes cost while history collapses. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation—spilled fluid’s micro-memories tightening stakes into joint stewardship.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating dojo constrains choices via event horizon shielding custody contract; brain jar’s fluid spillage evolves into rain charging closure. "Rewritten Pacific" anchors time/place early while magnetized obsidian cradle reflects professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single stake—defeating numbness—tightens through Kael’s deliberate jar-cracking, narrowing options to surrender. Cost is visceral: tears stinging like thaw, raw laughter slicing numbness, scaling perfectly to short-form pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final scroll line "become the storm that remembers it is water" reweights numbness through concrete rain-in-jar imagery, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges from spilled fluid’s micro-memories, not abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "chronal heat" and "anesthesia through shared veins." Kael-2’s flat dialogue contrasts Kael’s lyrical interiority; rhythm modulates from tense blade-draw to flowing closure breaths.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cerebrospinal fluid spilled... each droplet carrying a micro-memory" advances plot/theme simultaneously. Minor deduction for "numbness spreading like anesthesia" mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope via brain-as-character speaking "I am the feeling you outsourced." Risk-taking with custody contract’s living ink pays off through concrete rewriting history mechanics.</comment>
