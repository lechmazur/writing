<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in naming fears while holding the rosette, but "brittle armor of certainty" slips into diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, slightly undermining embodied emotion at peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when she offers the rosette to the girl—cost legible in "bitterness loosen, flakes of rust falling away"—though the hallway slur backstory slightly exceeds BRR limits without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rosette (micro-setting) charges the final image as a "portable silence," but "amber light pooled like spilled honey" edges toward sensory cliché without sufficient POV-specific filtering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through her micro-choices (naming fears, inviting silenced voices), yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—realization feels earned but not actively wrestled from the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through the rosette’s hollow becoming "an ear," avoiding moralizing; the final image’s "shared hollow" resonates as a non-literal answer to unlearning hatred.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("geese crossed the sky in shifting chevrons") and rhythmic control elevate tension, though "expectantly resigned" repeats as filter-phrase, momentarily dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density stumbles in "vanishing arts of mercy fraying like silk"—mixed metaphor—and a paraphrase loop ("subtract noise... subtract noise by naming it") slightly dulls closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "symbolic object" trope through the rosette’s concrete evolution from artifact to "wooden galaxy," but autumn/library motifs risk cliché without sufficient fresh inflection beyond lyrical execution.</comment>
