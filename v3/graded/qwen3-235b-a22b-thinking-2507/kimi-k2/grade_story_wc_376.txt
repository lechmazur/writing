<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through embodied action (vine shivering from half-truth), but brother’s absence lacks sufficient friction in peak apology scene; micro-choices under pressure (spreading map fragments) elevate interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (sweat-fogged glass during reconstruction, wilting fern), under Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure intensifies via sensory density ("vapor brightened, strengthened") without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Toxic sky actively constrains speech and shapes the archive’s rules; final image of "sky’s reflection... fractionally less bruised" recharges setting with earned thematic weight through character action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via archive’s physical cost (vapor wilting near lies), but brother’s apology lacks prior dramatic testing; pressure tightens through Lysandra’s spoken exchanges altering the environment ("vines unfurled greener").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (sealing vial with gilded ink, planting silver-leafed tea), avoiding moralizing; final image of etched voices on shoots delivers non-literal answer to "where lost conversations go" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in calligrapher’s synesthetic details ("apology smelled of crushed mint"), though "candor in small moments" slightly drifts toward thematic abstraction during map assembly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "phosphorescent fungi lit shelves of glass jars" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent during archive discovery avoids peak-beat dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "lost words" trope through zinc-etched postal codes and vapor physics; risk-taking (lyric archive mechanics) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise echoes standard magical realism tropes at surface level.</comment>
