<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (leaving vs. returning) shown through action, not summary; "intimately aloof" borders on label but embodied via physical stillness during rising water. Epiphany earned through lagoon dissolution, though younger self observation lacks deeper friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: lagoon receding leaves shell blank, painter walking away without looking back—visible cost in dissolved pigment and scarred mirror. Accumulative lens holds; pressure tightens via water rising to heart-level, reconfiguring "temporary eternity" with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cave network functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (wrong turn forces entry) and charges closure: lagoon's rising water physically alters tactics (stillness) while dissolving pigment reweights the final image. Mangrove roots as "unfinished brushstrokes" integrate tool into environment with causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with departure moment) tightens via lagoon rising, forcing renunciation of the sunrise's permanence. Cost legible in pigment bleeding and shell's blankness, but escalation leans passive—water's rise feels environmental rather than protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "temporary eternity" reweighted through lagoon dissolving/reforming the sunrise, answering the central question via final image of painting "space between heartbeats." Zero moralizing; cost crystallized in "stay long enough to forgive the leaving" as visceral, not abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: painter's visual/textural focus ("coral-pink pigment," "briars and whispering grasses") modulates rhythm during rising water. Minor drift when "conceptual cost" implied, but voice remains consistent; "intimately aloof" repetition taught early and paid off in gulls' "dialect."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dissolved and re-formed" repetition is patterned and purposeful. One borderline overwrought phrase ("breathing cool, tide-scented air") but no figurative muddle in closure beat. Final line's "space between heartbeats" achieves textural specificity without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "return to origin" trope via cave/lagoon metaphor—fresh synthesis where "temporary eternity" reconfigures time as dissolving pigment. Risk-taking in quiet closure (no dialogue, passive climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity of mangrove roots anchors universals.</comment>
