<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("music could only add") lacks embodied struggle; final choice feels sudden rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("dewdrops unformed," "colors drained upward"); Accumulative lens holds as density peaks at frost-code revelation before silent resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as micro-setting constraining choices (stepping on moss, reading frost code) and charges final image through color reversal; "quietly vivid" actively shapes tactile decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via atmospheric density ("air rearranged into corridors of echo") culminating in prophecy's catastrophic consequence; cost is felt through sensory reversal rather than abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "fold the sound inward" action; final image ("absence of the prophecy felt like music") reweights hush as active creation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting of childhood winters") sustains lyric compression; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing slightly undermines voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Overwriting in opening ("dewdrops forming... as dewdrops form") creates paraphrase loop; otherwise high density ("paper boat no bigger than a tear") drives propulsion without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of musical silence as active force feels inevitable; "folded silence" reconfiguration transforms trope through specific sensory stakes and earned closure.</comment>
