<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s manufactured memories vs. her hidden guilt; embodied emotion in "palms against stone balustrade" and "breath fogged the tin" avoids labels. Micro-choice to dig for truth earns final voice choice with felt cost: abandoning her trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "I chose silence, and I can choose voice" crystallizes stance with cost ("tempered regret loosening its grip"). Accumulative lens holds—driftwood density escalates pressure without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in terrace "exhale."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choice (sifting for truth) and charges closure (paper boat). "Cobalt terrace" pressures via tactile chill and dusk’s weight, but "cobalt" descriptor risks ornamental slightness despite strong integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. erasure) tighten via watch hand discovery, narrowing options to confession. Agency in digging/repairing drives escalation, but discovery feels slightly passive—not Mara’s active choice. Cost ("truth weighs less than silence") unmistakably reweights closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sieved hush" evolving from physical absence to emotional cost; final paper boat offers non-literal answer to "truth vs. silence" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—mother’s note implies wisdom through concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "worn smooth by salt and regret" and "dusk pressing cobalt"; rhythmic control peaks in "tickled faintly though no dial remained." No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via driftwood fragments pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "sieved hush deepened, a hush that was not absence of sound but absence of absolution." Minor "regret" tell in "worn smooth by salt and regret" slightly dilutes embodiment; final cut-off sentence risks confusion despite likely intentional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist guilt with physical relics (driftwood carvings); emotional specificity in "truth weighs less than silence" avoids templates. "Cobalt terrace" borders on trope but redeemed by tactile integration with regret’s weight.</comment>
