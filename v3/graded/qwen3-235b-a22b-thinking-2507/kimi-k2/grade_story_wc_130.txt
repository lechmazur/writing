<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (measuring sorrow to reverse loss) is embodied in concrete actions like tracing chipped patterns, with contradictory impulses (fear of the eyes vs. inventive hope) culminating in earned renunciation. No diagnostic labels; "throat tightened with buried optimism" shows embodied conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "ache soften into accompaniment" crystallizes ambiguous loss as a corridor with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory density (stalactite drip, sap drop) to the fern’s unfurling, reweighting stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone’s chipped patterns constrain Lira’s choices (tracing fractures) and charge the closure ("path glowed faintly from within, each step a solved note"). Micro-setting functions as essential environment, guiding her final walk and reconfiguring loss through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens the dominant stake (resolving ambiguous loss) via protagonist agency: each sensory detail (mineral salt petals, sap drop) intensifies emotional weight until the fern’s unfurling reconfigures options. Cost is unmistakable—"ache soften into accompaniment" charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete action: the fern’s unfurling offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "mathematics of emotion" by reweighting loss as walked-through accompaniment. Avoids moralizing; final image ("corridor rather than a wall") crystallizes complexity without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lira notices geological fractures as "narrative of breakage," with rhythm shifting from fragmented ("lantern trembling") to lyrical ("path glowed faintly"). Elision (sister’s disappearance) taught early and pays off in closure’s "parentheses" motif without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats like "petals of mineral salt drifted down, tasting of tears and iron" achieve high density with multi-sensory propulsion. Figurative language ("parentheses around the moon") remains coherent and payoff-driven, culminating in the un-muddled closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "ambiguous loss" through specific synthesis: grief as mathematical equation walked through step-by-step. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—fern unfurling feels inevitable from prior particulars, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
