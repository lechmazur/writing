<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete (luminescent ache, reeds carrying vanished names); contradictory impulses act simultaneously as Lira weaves while fearing abandonment. Final choice to build the arbor earns her endurance of community with visible cost in tears and "warm bracelets" of kinship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the completed arbor crystallizes options (solitude vs. belonging) with undeniable conceptual cost ("luminescent ache that says: you were expected"). Accumulative lens holds as density increases with each newcomer, reweighting the stake through tangible additions to the sculpture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard constrains every choice—Lira bends reeds through glass without breaking, Fen fuses droplets onto them. The micro-setting (obsidian arbor’s glass lattice) directly charges the final image as a "translucent heart," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira’s agency: her decision to press reeds into the soil initiates the deepening where strangers become kin. Cost is unmistakable in the "tears catching the glow" and the earned shift from solitary art to communal vulnerability, narrowing options to join or remain isolated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—the evolving arbor embodies kinship as labor, not abstraction. Final image ("you were expected") offers resonant non-literal answer to loneliness without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material through generational offerings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Lira notices through sculptor’s lens (smell of peat, reeds bending). Rhythmic control under pressure via varied cadence ("She stepped onto the obsidian causeway...") with no head-hopping; voice modulates from solitary ache to collective warmth without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple elements ("Fen heated a rod... sealing them in place" shows action, setting, and relationship). Figurative language precise ("glassy minerals that sang") with no muddle in peak beats, propulsion through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "found family" trope through specific, grounded details (crystalline orchard, reed glyph). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; the arbor’s generational evolution feels inevitable yet fresh, resisting abstraction.</comment>
