<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses—Elara's flawless execution omits struggle or tradeoffs despite high stakes. Strengths: embodied emotion ("wax yield like warm flesh") and micro-choices reveal archival identity. No visible cost in her process weakens the Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with legible cost ("faint scent of myrrh" marking translated confusion). Lens ambiguity pre-midpoint (Accumulative/Textural vs. Causal) caps score despite strong closure. Orientation anchors firmly by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ceremonial rope functions as essential micro-setting: constrains choices (braid reconfiguration) and charges closure (glowing "living chronicle"). Sensory specificity ("scents of myrrh," "teeth meshing like turning pages") avoids checklist. Meets 9+ gate via closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via rope reconfiguration, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—Elara reacts to the mechanism "pleading for translation" rather than active struggle. Cost ("faint scent of myrrh") is legible but passive under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through braided marginalia and students' sketches, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("borders that had always belonged") reweights absence as presence with conceptual cost. "Protective enchantment" realization risks thematic echo but stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct archival perceptual signature ("cataloguing each gear as manuscripts") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor scaffold: "warmly methodical" repetition (3x) dulls immediacy. Elision taught early; no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loop ("confusion was merely clarity..."/"translating confusion into clarity") and "warmly methodical" repetition reduce density. Final third avoids artifacts, but scaffold prevents 8.8+. No closure-dulling muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival work as temporal diplomacy. "Braids as historical record" transforms tropes via specific stakes. Emotional truth in "rope remembered otherwise" avoids abstraction. Transformation test passed—swapping "archivist" breaks tactile logic.</comment>
