<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority strong through embodied details like "boots humming" and "second heart beating," but clairvoyant's crisis ("futures pressed against skin") borders on diagnostic phrasing. Micro-choices under pressure earn the lullaby climax, though motivation ("magnify magic") remains slightly abstract until payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "I didn't see this, wonder raw in his throat." Accumulative lens holds through sonic density escalation, though "unseen forces" arrive past 25% mark—justified by narrative logic as emergent property of the pearl's interaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: sound becomes gate, crystals rearrange into ribs. Final image of dew reflecting "sunrise and cave’s lingering violet" charges the micro-setting (boots, lantern) with irreplaceable thematic weight. Only minor deduction for late "violet light" establishment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (magnifying magic vs. despair) tightens meaningfully when pilgrim presses pearl to wall, foreclosing clairvoyant's certainty. Cost is legible in his tears refracting light, though "ordinary choices stacked" revelation edges toward explanation versus pure dramatization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grocery-list lullaby and bread-smell steam—not moralizing. Final image reweights "bright darkness" without stating morals, embracing complexity via "small magnification of two strangers choosing to keep singing." Perfect thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: pilgrim notices "boots humming," clairvoyant sees "bruised rainbows" in tears. Rhythmic control peaks in "Sound became mirror, mirror became gate." Minor abstraction in "overlapping shadows" doesn't undermine pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "milk-white and faintly breathing" shows not tells. Sentences vary rhythmically to match tension ("higher, then lower, then sideways"). Only microscopic flaw: "rustled" slightly mismatches crystal setting but sonic context justifies it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via mundane magic (grocery-list lullaby, bread-smell steam). Emotional truth in clairvoyant's vulnerability avoids derivative safety. "Unseen forces = ordinary choices" insight feels earned, not clever—synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
