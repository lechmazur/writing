<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("algorithm than man") embodied in micro-choices like pocketing the globe with reverence while analyzing static; dissolution of written letters shows visible cost of understanding. Slight underdevelopment of Dee's role limits relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: dissolving letters and surrendering the globe crystallize "letting go" as physics. Accumulative lens holds through snow globe's evolving meaning; pressure tightens via recorder analysis to the zero-balance moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sunken library constrains every choice: coral throne seating, silt-sinking boots, and dissolving ink directly charge the final image. "1937 sky into 2023 water" exemplifies micro-setting (snow globe) dictating thematic resolution through salinity merger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding Earhart's surrender) escalates via recorder analysis to the zero-balance revelation; cost is legible in shivering and dissolving text. Agency drives deepening (rewinding, charting) under accumulative lens without requiring causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of dissolving letters and broadcasting snow globe offers resonant answer: "equal and opposite reaction" reweights holding/letting go as physics. Avoids moralizing while charging "quiet certainty of release" through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("boots sinking in silt," "spectral meters flicker like guilt") filters all detail through diver's analytical lens. Rhythmic control intensifies during recorder analysis ("lift decreasing, drag prevailing") without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flakes rearrange into the same broken sentence" demonstrates multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language ("dream that had forgotten to wake") remains coherent in high-pressure beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms death encounter trope through Earhart's snow globe physics; specific "salinity merger" detail creates freshness. Risk-taking (drowned library as analysis site) heightens stakes but proximity to Sandman-esque motifs caps just below 9-band.</comment>
