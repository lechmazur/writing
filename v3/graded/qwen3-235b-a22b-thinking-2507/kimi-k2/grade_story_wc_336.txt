<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in creative surplus as burden drives credible sacrifice; embodied contradiction in "leak through which wonder might drain" elevates interiority. Minor deduction for slightly surface-level emotional layering despite strong marrow-draining cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("hands began to silver," "breath grew thin"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation. One tightening (weaving process narrowing to sacrifice) suffices, though cost proof could be slightly sharper in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall's spray actively constrains choices (prisms for weaving) and charges final image (paused cascade); micro-setting of copper threads directly enables closure. Environment functions as essential tool, meeting 9+ gate with no ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("color leaching into gray") tighten through Arin's agency—each spun essence draws marrow threads, visibly escalating cost. Single deepening (weaving as reciprocal gift) forecloses survival path with felt sacrifice; escalation unmistakable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "reciprocal gift" reweights preservation without moralizing. Final image (tree spiraled like braid) offers resonant answer to "color of wonder" with conceptual cost (Arin's vessel gone), avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hearing extra notes in thrush’s song") controls rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping. Lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure with crystalline control ("radiant hush now inside his ribs").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("coppery taste of a child’s unanswered question") advances multiple purposes without muddle. Final lines achieve propulsion ("trunk spiraled like a braid") with no figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms sacrifice trope through orchard-pruner lens (grafting as world-weaving); emotional specificity in creative burnout feels fresh. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 bonus).</comment>
