<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "sorrow and joy braided so tightly they became the same thread" and voice-cracking persistence, though fleeting abstraction in "maps of where every root had once reached" slightly dilutes interiority under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "memories scatter again, lighter now" crystallizes earned renewal; Accumulative lens holds perfectly as woven dawns' density increase reweights stakes through the blossom sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mica window constrains choice (flaking under pressure) and charges the final image ("unbearably white" panes); alchemical orchard's soil literally answers her whisper, making environment inseparable from the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as night "unravels her song faster than she could weave it," with agency visible in the peach-name whisper that triggers the trembling earth—a single decisive deepening that forecloses easy victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bound release" and the child tasting peach in the final line, reweighting memory's fragility without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by embedding cost in "seeds on new wind" rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dominates ("air tasted of iron and lullabies"), with rhythmic compression during strain ("She knelt. Pressed her forehead.") heightening pressure while maintaining distinct voice; no head-hopping in single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-loop in "sorrow and joy braided" slightly echoes earlier "knotting them together," and "faintly with the last embers" has minor modifier stack, but propulsion remains impeccable with zero scaffold in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through visceral specifics (mica flaking "like fish scales," phoenix fireflies); emotional truth in "bound release" avoids genericity while risk-taking in lyric escalation heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
