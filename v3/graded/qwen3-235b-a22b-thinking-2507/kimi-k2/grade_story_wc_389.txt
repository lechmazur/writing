<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("soldering wires to dreams") without contradictory impulses; "Remember" climax lacks visible struggle to earn endurance. Solitude motivation clear but no flaws complicate choices—anti-pattern of perfect calibration under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "earth began to turn a shade lighter" reconfigures stakes with felt cost ("borrowed clocks"). Orientation flawless from first sentence; Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to equinox rupture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt portico constrains every choice—cracked pane forces ear-to-crack intimacy, final "petals of blue shadow" charges closure. Micro-setting mastery: transistors/candle wax patch evolves into "taste of iron and lilac" communion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("shape new dawn") declared but never viscerally felt; equinox lightning strike is coincidence, not agency-driven escalation. Cost legible only at final image ("shade lighter"), missing mid-beat tradeoffs despite strong density buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "taste of iron and lilac" not moralizing; "Remember" is resonant non-literal answer to "first word" question. Loses 0.2 for underdeveloped counter-theme (ancient shadows' danger) in final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "cobalt glass drank the lightning" shows character-specific noticing. Syntax compresses under pressure ("pressed her ear... tasting ozone") without voice slippage—meets 9+ test for rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "bellies full of static harvested like berries" risks slight metaphor muddle but payoff in "chord made floorboards ripple" justifies density. Final fragment "would not be gentle; it would" risks confusion but serves Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prophet trope via collective remembrance; "second spine of morning" is fresh inflection. Loses 0.1 for observatory setting bordering on familiar archetype despite specific transistors/candle wax details.</comment>
