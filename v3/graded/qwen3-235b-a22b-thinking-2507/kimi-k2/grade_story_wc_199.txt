<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear vs. curiosity) drives action; embodied emotion in "mossy delight curling around ribs" avoids abstraction. Transformation choice earned by prior monument-building micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost: "body dissolved into motes of walnut-stained light" crystallizes the cycle’s price. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—leaf count decline tightens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ashen arbor constrains every choice (climbing, monument placement); moonstone dust charges the final image as "dust-speck pressed into skin." Micro-setting (walnut-stained fingers) evolves to "motes of light," shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via leaf depletion (one tightening suffices), forcing Elian’s agency through monument-building. Cost is legible in dissolution: "roots in clouds" becomes literal forfeiture of human form under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "emerges transformed always" motif—final image of "new leaf spelling next folklore" reweights the cycle without moralizing. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "mossy laughter" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("veins spelling script too delicate for ordinary eyes") filters all details. Rhythmic control peaks in closure’s cadence shift: "seed... sprout... tree... ash... seed." Zero head-hopping; voice modulates with intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "fear pricked him—but curiosity was stronger" has minor scaffold. Final line’s "mossy laughter" avoids sentimentality through concrete sound. Zero loops; density never blurs cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms folklore trope via seed-sorting specificity. "Monuments fit thumb’s hollow" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh stakes. Risk-taking (human-to-leaf transformation) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
