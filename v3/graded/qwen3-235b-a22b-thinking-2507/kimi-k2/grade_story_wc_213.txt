<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in "favoring listening over noise" shown through Coast Guard contrast and "I listened" correction. Micro-choices like battery switch mid-climb reveal professional focus under spiritual pressure. Slight thinness in contradictory impulses during climax weakens 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "feeling the weight settle like responsibility" crystallizes permanent duty. Accumulative lens holds through microclimate data tightening toward zero hour. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bell rope and barometer function as micro-setting that charges closure: coiled rope "like responsibility" and mercury drop directly shape the final image. Sanctuary’s role as "resonant cavity" constrains every action with environmental necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the bell’s purpose) escalates through barometric precision, but conflict lacks visible price during climax beyond abstract responsibility. Agency in the pull decision is strong, yet cost remains conceptual rather than embodied in the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "I listened" correction reweights listening as active practice. Final image ("solstice hush traveled with him") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids binaries by fusing technical skill and spiritual duty through microclimate "syllables."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mercury sink to red line," "clouds like parchment") with rhythmic control: long observation sentences fracture into crisp action at "He pulled." Elision of monks' dialogue taught early and paid off in the Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stars dripped like meltwater" exemplifies high-density imagery. Final line crystallizes theme through concrete action ("tracking microclimate variations"). Minor deduction for "credibly curious" telling, but redeemed by subsequent embodied choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and spirituality avoids cliché by making listening a technical skill. Transformation test passed: changing names/locations would break copper seams and barometer specificity. Risk-taking elevates beyond expected tropes but lacks radical unprecedentedness for 9+.</comment>
