<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysandra's motivation burns bright but lacks contradictory impulses; her defiance remains monolithic without internal struggle (e.g., no moment questioning if beauty justifies exile). Embodied emotion shines in "charcoal-stained fingers against pale spire" yet micro-choices under pressure feel singularly resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the spire blooming into refracted light, reconfiguring forgiveness with visible cost (Council's broken monopoly). But the ritual's deferral feels slightly convenient—guards surrender without showing active resistance beyond lowered weapons, weakening causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bone towers constrain every choice: Lysandra's poetry fractures light to challenge penance, and the pale spire's transformation charges the final image ("prism of possibility"). Sensory specificity—"mist thickened," "charcoal-stained fingers"—anchors urgency while echoing canyon walls mirror internal defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lysandra's agency as refracted stories multiply ("echoes... grew hungrier"), tightening the truth-vs-penance conflict. But guards' surrender lacks felt cost—they recognize hidden stories instantly without visible struggle, making the resolution slightly convenient under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through refracted light as metaphor for forgiveness, avoiding moralizing until "forgiveness as a garden" risks thematic echo. Final image ("canyon transformed... refrains that celebrated") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "imperfect wholeness" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "echoes never died; they only grew hungrier" filters the world through Lysandra’s artistic urgency. Rhythm modulates perfectly—from hushed tension ("forged hush before ritual") to explosive defiance ("symphony of defiance")—with no head-hopping despite crowd presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion excels: "light split through the bone, refracting her words into thousand shards" avoids overwriting while doing triple duty. One paraphrase loop near climax ("rainbow confessions"/"painted canyon walls with stories") slightly dulls closure’s density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone towers as truth-refractors transforms penance tropes through specific physics (light frequencies, echoes multiplying). Risk-taking heightens stakes—poetry as weapon—without gimmickry, though canyon setting leans slightly archetypal.</comment>
