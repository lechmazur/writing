<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "resiliently positive" deckhand shoulders timeline collapse while hiding burden ("permanent transient smile"). Micro-choices under pressure (turning hourglass sideways, radioing frequencies) reveal hierarchy of values with visceral cost ("weight of every parallel second settle into her palms"). No diagnostic labels; embodied emotion through tactile details like sand pooling "like light against eyelids".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with undeniable conceptual cost: sideways sand and "ghost timetable" crystallize Cass's permanent role as threshold guardian. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—radio patterns braiding into music and grotto's responsive starlight tighten options via density increase. Cost proof: "eyes stinging with unshed tears of déjà vu" makes temporal displacement felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hourglass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: Cass turning it sideways aligns flow with tilted clocks, while final image of "sand still slid sideways" reweights time's nature. Spectral grotto actively pressures decisions (starlight revealing "corridors of possibility"), avoiding postcard description. Sensory selection narrows during crisis to tactile radio dials and auditory "low chord that folded space".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Cass's agency under Accumulative lens: radio patterns evolve from "Morse, then melody, then memory" to stitching timelines, narrowing options through patterned intensification. Dominant stake (merging timelines) signaled early via "motivation crystallized" and tightened when "passengers saw their younger selves board." Cost unmistakable in commuters' "déjà vu tears" and Cass's irreversible role shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: radio frequencies braiding into music and sideways sand reweight time's fluidity without moralizing. Final image ("sand slid sideways whenever she tilted it") offers resonant non-literal answer to temporal fragmentation, charging prior material through specific mechanics. Avoids thematic echo—no abstract statements, only Cass's quiet endurance crystallizing the cost of integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Cass notices "stars looked sideways" and "minutes crawl along the horizon like crabs," filtering reality through temporal distortion. Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from urgent short sentences ("She felt the ferry lurch—not forward... but downward") to lyrical radio sequences. Purposeful compression ("time could be folded like paper") taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "stalactites of frozen moonlight dripping into pools that reflected futures" achieves high density without scaffold. Zero paraphrase loops or figurative muddle in peak beats; final line "counting moments that refused to stay in line" crystallizes closure with precise rhythm. Slight synonym churn on "resiliently positive" (para 3 vs. 15) prevents 10.0 but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel tropes through ferry setting: "radio across frequencies that braided themselves into music" transforms merging timelines into tactile, sonic labor. Emotional truth in Cass's quiet endurance ("refused to let any of them drift away") avoids generic solutions. Risk-taking heightens stakes—sideways sand and "ghost timetable" deepen coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
