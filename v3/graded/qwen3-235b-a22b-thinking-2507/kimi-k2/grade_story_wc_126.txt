<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "giving voice to what might yet be" versus family tradition's focus on loss; embodied emotion via "velvet movement against skin" avoids labels. Final renunciation of playing (hair like "strings she would never tighten") earns closure with visible cost—her voice becoming part of the hush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the green shoot in the bowl crystallizes reconfigured stakes (silence as generative) with conceptual cost (her voice dissolved into hush). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density ("drip become waltz rhythm") to narrow options into storytelling as sole action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass "filmed with soot" constrains choice (turning sunlight into sepia) and charges final image (bowl holding new shoot). Every detail serves urgency: "charred mango leaves" narrow perception to immediacy while "passionfruit vines" mirror wild, untamed hope in the violinist's act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: her storytelling deepens pressure as "chronic hush" fractures into "possibility," reweighting the dominant stake (beauty in unfinished). Cost is unmistakable—"voice became part of the hush"—altering tactics (no violin play, only conducting) with felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mendicant's bowl" holding both ash and seed—no stated moral. Final image ("silence... half-complete until someone listens") reweights "chronic hush" as generative without sentimentality, though "beauty in the unfinished" risks thematic echo but stays earned via concrete shoot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("hearing every heartbeat of the world") shapes all noticing; rhythm modulates under pressure ("drip become waltz rhythm" uses syntactic compression). No POV slippage—only her acoustic lens filters "creak of shipwrecks" into "bass line," teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Empty case light as a promise" uses stock simile in closure beat (-0.3 artifact), but otherwise zero loops. Propulsion via strong verbs ("stirred," "fracture," "cradling"); "sepia memory" and "soot-stained fingers" avoid purple prose through textural specificity tied to stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms violinist trope via "soot-stained fingers" and ecological trauma; "chronic hush" as active character feels inevitable. Risk-taking (silence as orchestra) heightens stakes without gimmickry—green shoot in ash-soil proves beauty finds you, resisting template endings.</comment>
