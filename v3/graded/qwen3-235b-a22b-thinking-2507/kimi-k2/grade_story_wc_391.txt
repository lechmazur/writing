<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority shines through embodied choices (cairn marking, compass reliance), but flaw testing is shallow—no genuine struggle beyond observation limits her from 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the viaduct’s emergence reconfigures stakes with elders weeping and children running, making "patience sculpts" legible through cost in the final image without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt shards constrain choice (cairn building) and charge closure (frost melting to reveal iron), while the frozen lake’s micro-setting directly enables the fracture’s geometry—exceeding 9+ gate with environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens—moon-path tracking intensifies to the rails’ hum and deliberate fracture—narrows options with visible cost (elders’ tears, altered town behavior), fulfilling agency through Elara’s patient methodology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "patience sculpts" crystallizes the central question without abstraction, and the town’s daily walks reweight patience as destination, avoiding any thematic echo in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("thunder wearing mittens," compass as "heartbeat under glass"), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure; zero head-hopping and consistent focalization elevate to 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "restrained wildness" achieves maximum density without muddle, and the final line recharges prior motifs with crystalline propulsion—prose flawlessly serves the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of patience as revolution avoids cliché through specific mechanics (mirrored disks, basalt iron), but emotional risk-taking lacks a transformative flaw, capping below 9.0 despite strong originality.</comment>
