<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied emotion (trembling hands shifting to certainty), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear yet resolves too neatly without sustained tension between city/volcano needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (volcano's "gentle pulse" reconfiguring stakes), with felt cost in Lira's stopped trembling and fragile harmony; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The antique surveyor's chain constrains choice (calibrating slack to millimeter) and charges the final image (coiling it as "metronome for new harmony"), meeting the 9+ gate through functional specificity over decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency is subtle (chain tension calibration narrowing options), but the cost—volcano's precarious rest—remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized in the pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (water's "lullaby of regulated flow"), not abstraction; the final image reweights "harmonize conflicting values" without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity in the volcano's "inhale."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines (engineering details filtered through Lira's tactile focus), though "slyly heartfelt" repetition slightly dilutes rhythmic control under peak pressure of the lever engagement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "dappled resolve settle over her like sunlight through leaves" slightly dulls momentum, but no closure artifacts; high density maintained through purposeful concrete verbs ("clinking," "murmur," "fluttered").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms engineering tropes via specific volcanic context and "encrypted compassion" motif; the quiet climax risks sentimentality but avoids it through precise physical stakes (magma chambers vs. terraces).</comment>
