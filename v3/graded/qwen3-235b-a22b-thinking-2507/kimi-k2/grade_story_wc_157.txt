<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lysander's embodied defiance shines through micro-choices (thorn-written "still," flicking mimic) but lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle; "spark might burn hand" shows cost yet internal contradiction remains underdeveloped at pivotal warp moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Valid conceptual repricing closure as gardens exhale "fragrance of defiance" with undeniable conceptual cost, but "grafting onto every" cutoff slightly blurs causality under accumulative lens; moonset deadline tightens pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains choices (pitcher plant disposal, beetle translation) and charges final image; gourd seed's spiral code directly shapes tactics, though pinned moths detail feels ornamental without altering outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lysander's garden checks under auditor pressure, with "moonset" deadline creating live clock; cost legible in "spark might burn hand" but mimic confrontation relies slightly on convenient disposal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("baker who spelled rebellion in basil"), avoiding moralizing; final fragrance image reweights "taxable thoughts" conceptually though "spark of defiance" phrasing risks thematic echo early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct entomological perceptual signature ("orchid mantis nymphs practiced prayers") with rhythmic control under stress; purposeful compression taught early via "candidly cryptic," though "converging chaos" momentarily drifts into elevated diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("sirens returned, louder, converging") but greenhouse description stalls momentum; no closure-dulling artifacts though "candidly cryptic" repetition borders on scaffold without deepening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought taxation via garden ciphers avoids dystopian clichés; emotional truth in "child who taught sunflowers to wink" elevates trope, with beetle-mimics feeling newly imagined rather than derivative.</comment>
