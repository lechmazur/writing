<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grief was a kind of hurry" as Lira suppresses emotion to sustain ritual; embodied choices like heel-to-toe movement reveal character under pressure without therapy-speak. Slight underdevelopment of alchemy specifics holds back full 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the sealed plate beating with starlight reconfigures hope with visible cost ("discarded items crumbled"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through spiral pattern intensification; cost legible in expended items and emotional restraint at "throat tightened".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (copper plate) charges final image as "paper constellations beat in quiet synchrony"; orchard roots directly constrain spiral creation. Sensory details like "frost remembering it was once water" avoid cliché while mirroring internal state through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual precision: hurry becomes "noise" that could shatter starlight, narrowing options to the sealing act. Cost is unmistakable in crumbled items and suppressed grief; agency entirely Lira's under Accumulative lens with "seventh turn" deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete actions: "grief was a kind of hurry" avoids moralizing while final image reweights memory preservation as "paper constellations beat... ready to be unfolded". No thematic echo; resonance built from orchard's "faint shimmer" recharging opening frost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "frost clung like last syllables of a prayer"; rhythmic control peaks with "thum-whump" heartbeat folding. Compression taught early via ritual pacing pays off in closure without head-hopping; stress shortens diction appropriately.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moist quivered, caught between paper and life" demonstrates peak-beat density without muddle. Final line recharges opening with "sky remembered how to shine", avoiding overwriting while every phrase advances atmosphere or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual through specific alchemy ("distilled patience of glaciers"); emotional truth in suppressing tears to sustain starlight avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off with "faint shimmer" charging the orchard's stillness meaningfully.</comment>
