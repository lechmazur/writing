<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "persuasion was not command but invitation" realization, earned through embodied micro-choices (kneeling, dancing) with visible cost in heartbeat skip and permanent rhythm shift; no stock phrasing despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: skipped heartbeat, dual footprints, and children's humming crystallize the "fragile treaty" between reality/possibility; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through lullaby's patterned escalation to terrace's final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism parapet and locket function as micro-setting—wet stone syncs heartbeat, rainbows enable mirages—directly charging the final image where stone retains "soft imprint of two footprints"; sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects urgency (calm kneeling vs. bell-driven stillness).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when "persuasion was not command" insight forces tactical shift to dancing; cost legible in heartbeat skip and permanent rhythm change, though secondary "mirrors dimmed" consequence slightly dilutes primary focus on painter's internal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "brittle truths" vs. "dusky harmony" tension; final mirror image showing "girl with two shadows" reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding anti-patterns through concrete particulars (paper boats, glass birds) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of wet marble," "colors clung like shy memories") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in lullaby description ("intervals between syllables spelled coordinates") teaches the Accumulative pattern paid off in terrace's humming echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—each sentence advances story (e.g., "dripped from stone arches" establishes setting/mood simultaneously); no figurative muddle in peak beats like the heartbeat skip, where "permanent rhythm" crystallizes cost with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "borrowed heartbeat" trope through painter's method (locket as "fragile paintbrush," lullabies as coordinates); avoids sentimentality with concrete stakes (pulse faltering without locket), though "dusky harmony" risks cliché without final image's "colors no eye had yet named" redemption.</comment>
