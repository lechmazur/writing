<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Lira’s resolve vs grief manifests through vial-handling micro-choices; child’s embodied sorrow avoids therapy-speak. "Silence isn’t empty" dialogue risks label-speak but earns resonance via physical action (palming vial). Minor motivation abstraction ("teach silence how to comfort") slightly dilutes causality for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: child stepping off "lighter" with vial’s still water crystallizes transformed relationship to silence, cost visible in dried tears and suitcase shift. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through sensory density (snowflake→rain→flurry) reweighting "vaulting hush" from absence to presence. Orientation anchors (gondola/canal/train) established by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace actively constrains choices (tilting when child boards) and charges closure (refracted starlight halo); storm glass’s evolving weather mirrors emotional shifts. "Fluidly logical" trait isn’t just labeled—it dictates vial’s responses that alter Lira’s tactics. Final still water image inseparable from setting’s thematic charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (holding silence after loss) tightens through Lira’s noise-monitoring rhythm and the child’s sigh catalyzing the vial’s flurry. Escalation is accumulative—pressure deepens via sensory cadence shifts (heartbeat counts → breathing guidance) not causal turns, perfectly fitting the lens. Cost is legible in the child’s physical lightening at departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial’s reconfigured weather: silence as "a room we build together" gains resonance via the snow-train vanishing into stillness, not moralizing. Final image ("smiled at the quiet") reweights the opening’s "heavier than any cargo" without stating a moral. Avoids Thematic Echo despite thematic dialogue by grounding insight in concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "boots whispering over prisms" and "lap of water against terrace edge"—Lira’s sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) reflects her vocation. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: short clauses during the sigh’s catalysis ("Minutes passed like held breath"), lyrical flow in closure. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays embodied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clouds blooming like ink in water" avoids mixed metaphor by serving vial mechanics. Final line’s "ready to ferry the next echo" recharges opening with crystalline propulsion. Slight register drift in "fluidly logical" descriptor is immediately dramatized by vial’s response, avoiding overwriting penalties in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "comforting a child" trope through storm glass physics and prism terrace mechanics—specifics make emotional arc inevitable. "Silence as room" synthesis feels fresh yet grounded in Lira’s vocation. Avoids safety middle with bold quiet closure, though "vaulting hush" risks poetic cliché mitigated by concrete sensory execution.</comment>
