<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("rehearsing loss rather than reversing it") and embodied emotion ("knees stiff with cold") earn closure; micro-choices like thread placement reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("knees stiff," blue flowers folding); Accumulative lens holds through memory accumulation, reweighting absence with conceptual cost in final quince scent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden setting constrains choices (writing on air, thread path) and charges final image ("lonesome splendor inside her"); micro-setting of thread directly shapes tactics and closure's red pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's writing escalation ("wrote faster, threading memory through dusk"), narrowing options to acceptance; visible cost in physical stiffness and dissolving sister-image forecloses return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("boat of songs," quince scent), avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "geography of healing" as shared coastline without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaves like obituaries," tasting absences) with rhythmic control; compression taught early via air-writing pays off in moth-wing sister rendering.</comment>
<question>7</question><question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("frost retreats from first articulate sun") but zero loops; high density in closure beat ("blue flowers folded into seeds, planning explained absence") with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary ritual with absence geography; risk-taking in air-writing deepens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable via thread's charged reprise at fountain.</comment>
