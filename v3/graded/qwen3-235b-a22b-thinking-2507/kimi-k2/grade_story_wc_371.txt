<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("guard memory" vs "coax future") drives earned renunciation; embodied grief in bread-tasting; micro-choice of planting seeds forecloses vigilant guarding with palpable cost in treaty-with-time line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes in "treaty with time" line—visible cost of forgetting balances growth; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through patterned seed/bread/soil motif reweighting loss; frost-to-shoot cadence shift charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moss-swallowed marble and seed-pouch constrain choices; "rectangle of darker stone" where bakery stood charges final image; sensory hierarchy (cardamom, frost, porcelain clinks) mirrors emotional urgency without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred in ordinary) tightens via keeper's "absolution is grown" line, forcing protagonist's shift from guarding to planting; cost legible in "I will forget a little" treaty—agency reconfigures options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread-to-seed evolution: "sacred had never been in the bakery itself" reweights premise without moralizing; closure image (shoot vs frost) offers resonant answer to loss/renewal with conceptual cost of forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer") filters details through grief; rhythmic control in "steam rose, smelling of yeast and memory" compresses time; no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "baptizing the ground" avoids purple prose through concrete context; minor register drift in "heuristically gentle" (-0.3) but no closure impact; final shoot image charges momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic trope via textural focus on "small disappearances"; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth; "map of small defiances" synthesizes premise into indelible final image.</comment>
