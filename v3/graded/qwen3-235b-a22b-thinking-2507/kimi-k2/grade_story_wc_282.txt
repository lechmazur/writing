<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak in climax; Lira's choice to press fossil lacks visible struggle against competing impulses despite clear motivation. No micro-choice during pivotal contact shows hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: sleeper's milky eyes meeting Lira's with cost legible in "recorder silent" and fossil's history rewritten. Accumulative lens holds with density increase reweighting stakes through emotional murals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal cave network functions as micro-setting: narrowing stone throat constrains choice, bioluminescent algae charges final image. Fossil's physical light becomes the final signature's "compassionate gold," charging closure through object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via emotional accumulation, but cost legibility falters—Lira's silent recorder implies loss yet "heart loud" undercuts sacrifice. Agency narrows options (not waking sleeper) but felt cost lacks visceral punch in final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fossil's transformation: "voice travels forward by listening back" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of Lira's self-portrait reweights "transitional being" concept with undeniable conceptual cost of relinquished role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: "salt wind tangling hair" filtered through map-maker's urgency. Rhythmic control peaks in dream sequence with purposeful compression ("cities dissolving into forests") taught early via fossil's solstice behavior.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in "heat-mapping emotions" beats (pulse/release/erupted) slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "grief becoming coral, joy becoming gull wings" achieves maximum density without muddle in peak closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hibernation mythos with sensory cartography; "emotional residue" concept transforms trope through concrete stakes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence—caves sealing "like lips after a secret" feels inevitable yet startling.</comment>
