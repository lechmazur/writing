<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (clinging to echoes vs. precognitive forgetting) drives concrete micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion ("knees grinding," "tasting limestone") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation earned but flaw isn't tested in a high-stakes tradeoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("man-shaped shell of driftwood and chalk") under Accumulative lens; fog folding inward reweights the premise. Minor uncertainty whether the "sound" is sufficiently dramatized before the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (chalk/driftwood) constrains choices—fog erasing chalk lines forces tactile navigation—and charges the final sculpture. Some atmospheric details ("gull cried") feel decorative without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: each action (spiral drawing, chalk press) tightens the Accumulative pressure until the tone "bends into a minor key." Cost is visceral ("years press against his skin") and visible in the transformed sculpture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: echoes as "proof that something had once been louder," the final image reweights it as "the echo of his listening remained." Zero moralizing; insight earned via the chalk spiral's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of magnetic dust," static "flickered like candlelight") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early (e.g., "knees grinding" implies pain) with zero scaffolding in closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("faint white scars that the fog licked away") with clear propulsion. Figurative language precise even in peak beats ("tone wavered, bending into a minor key that tasted of salt and iron").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "junkyard prophet" defined by rusted keys/chalk, not mysticism; emotional specificity in "remembered teaching a girl... though her face dissolved." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
