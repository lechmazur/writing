<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") embodied through appraiser's factual recitation versus gut-level grief; final choice to pocket cloth earned by visceral cloth analysis ("sweat and smoke trapped in fibers") showing micro-choices under pressure without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("it was waiting") reconfigures silence with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds via sensory density accumulation (quarry echoes → cloth vibration → final quiet) with visible cost in "let the facts fall away" beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Speaker cloth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (analysis → pocketing) and charges final image; quarry's "echo valley" actively mirrors internal state through tactile details ("gray scar," "bassline swell") rather than static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist's agency: cloth analysis deepens until reweighted as "a question," narrowing options to "couldn't stay" with visible cost in abandoning factual insulation; dominant stake ("silence after song ends") tested through sensory pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("it was waiting") provides resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing; theme emerges solely through cloth's transformation from relic to question, avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("Celestion speakers replaced in '89") and rhythmic control evident in climax ("He didn't know. But he knew..."); purposeful compression of backstory taught early and paid off in closure's earned stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "fluorescent light flickering...stage lights dying" establishes setting/history/emotion); final line's cadence ("It wasn't empty. It was waiting.") achieves perfect propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis using speaker cloth (not guitar/pick) as emotional anchor; specific roadie details ("Omaha show crowd rush") transform trope; risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
