<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through taste-memories (refugee's lemon, bittersweet cacao), but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension during pivotal pruning; grief/hope remain layered yet distinct rather than clashing in real-time choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the threshold fruit offering crystallizes communal hope with visible cost in the boy's tearful vulnerability, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse actively constrains choices (pruning dead vines to release memories) and charges the final image (rose-gold transformation); broken glass fracturing light becomes the precise tool that reweights closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density: sirens and eviction notices tighten pressure, but the celestial alignment's peak lacks causal linkage to Marisol's agency—transformation feels earned yet slightly coincidental rather than driven by her pruning choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through taste-memory transmutation (grief into chlorophyll), avoiding moralizing; "grow what never was allowed" stays character-grounded. Lacks one deeper layer of moral ambiguity in the rebellion's cost to fully reach 9-band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted the air—copper, ozone, vanilla of hope") persists under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's threshold moment without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-duplicate "synaptic plasticity" phrasing creates a 0.3 loop penalty; otherwise exquisite propulsion ("vines synapses, leaves neurons") with zero scaffold in peak beats, though "silver script" slightly strains botanical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "knowledge fruit" trope through chef's taste-memory lens and synaptic gardening; risk-taking in sensory rebellion feels inevitable. Needs one more unexpected turn beyond the communal forest to justify 9.5+.</comment>
