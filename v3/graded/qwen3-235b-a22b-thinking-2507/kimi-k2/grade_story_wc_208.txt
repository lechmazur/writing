<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in timing ("early"/"late") reveals Mara's tension between agency and fate; micro-choices in knot-tying embody her value hierarchy. Secondary characters lack sufficient pressure on her core conflict despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands when Mara realizes alliances are "spirals, each turn lifting the next"—cost is her surrender to cyclical time. Orientation perfect within 30 words; accumulative lens holds through layered meaning accrual without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Archway actively constrains choices (wind resistance, salvage materials) and charges the final image as "driftwood heart beating with borrowed time." Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows during storm (salt, turbine-hum) while expanding at dawn (polished obsidian marsh).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara's understanding of time as linear vs. cyclical—tightens through her agency in rebuilding the archway. Cost crystallizes when older Mara dissolves: Mara must embrace the loop's "reckless" demand, foreclosing solitary creation for communal legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through driftwood grain and lantern light—not abstract statement. Final image of the blank slide reweights "timewoven alliances" as active co-creation, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material with cyclical responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Mara's sculptor-eye noticing ("crooked rib for every promise kept"). Minor register drift when cartographer arrives; "driftwood tea" slightly over-articulated for high-stress aftermath of temporal paradox.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "turbine-hum reverie" motif varies rhythmically under pressure. Slight overwriting in "threads of light weaving outward" risks figurative muddle but avoids closure impact. Final line’s "spirals" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope through tactile specificity: knots, driftwood grain, and lantern mechanics ground cosmic stakes. Risk-taking (multi-temporal dialogue) heightens coherence; the archway’s "expectant" rebirth feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
