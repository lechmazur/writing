<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Guardian’s embodied contradiction shines (“wait was its oldest vow” vs admitting uncertainty sits beside it), but acolyte’s transformation lacks sufficient motivation groundwork; micro-choice of pressing echo-key reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the boundary holds “by invitation” with conceptual cost of uncertainty welcomed, but orientation debt persists past 120 words (veil of sleep concept unanchored early), narrowly avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains choices: petrified rosemary’s locked scent released only after pendant resolution charges the final image; frost patterns rearranging into alphabets directly alters the guardian’s reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Escalation driven by guardian’s agency: pendant’s oscillations force “interiorizing exteriors” method to deepen pressure, culminating in the cost of admitting uncertainty’s proximity; stakes crystallize through the echo-key ritual with felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (pressing echo-key to pendant), not abstraction; final image of rosemary releasing captive scents embodies “thaw” without moralizing, reweighting “light as wound” with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“mist into sentences, snow into semicolons”) persists under pressure; acolyte’s dialogue (“running only widens the wound”) slightly over-articulates, but foggy lucidity modulates perfectly to crystalline clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; “frost patterns rearranged into unfamiliar alphabets” charges closure with precise textural density; minor scaffold in “membrane becoming drumskin” (redundant with “stretch thin”) barely dents otherwise immaculate propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through visceral specificity (“fur bearing frost’s silver script”); echo-key ritual synthesizes uncertainty into fresh, inevitable action that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
