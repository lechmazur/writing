<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied grief ("slow collapse of shoulders like pane fracturing") and contradictory impulses (broker vs. returner), but "grief were a greenhouse pane" slightly abstracts physicality. Final renunciation earned by scent-triggered memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: releasing the scent forecloses his brokerage with visible cost ("weight evaporated"). Accumulative lens holds through scent memories, with cost legible in the dawn departure. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices (kneeling among phosphorescent leaves) and charges closure (rekindled lanterns). The vial functions as micro-setting, its drop fall directly altering the plants' state and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stake (sell vs. return memory) tightens when scent reveals the cereus transformed into itself. Escalation driven by Elian's agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in evaporated weight of sold memories at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent-as-seed metaphor without moralizing. Final line ("every scent is a seed, every tear is rain") reweights all prior material as resonant non-literal answer to why smells trigger tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aromatically cautious," "crystal shadows") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from measured to fragmented during scent-triggered memories, with pattern taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fragrance burst outward like a silent bell" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only minor deduction: "pane fracturing" slightly overwrites grief's physicality, but never dulls closure's charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through scent-broker lens. "Aromatically cautious" synthesizes emotional specificity with fresh occupational detail, while risk-taking (scent as living elegy) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
