<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied resolve anchors the retrocognition, but contradictory impulses (fear vs duty) remain implied rather than enacted in high-stakes debris arrangement; "tremor in her knees" lacks visceral counterpoint to her stated resolve during the pivotal naming sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the lagoon’s reflection crystallizes the unbroken chain of witness, while "responsibility" replaces retrocognitive hold. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as debris patterns and rising water reweight truth’s cost without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (debris mirrored in water) and charges the final image (dual reflection). Salt-stained twigs and warm water provide tactile specificity that actively shapes the archivist’s method and emotional climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via textural density—rising black veins mirroring debris—narrows options to naming as the only path forward. Cost is legible in the "warm, almost breathing" water and "responsibility" shift, though the lagoon’s compliance slightly softens the stakes’ tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lagoon’s liquid memory and debris-as-language, avoiding moralizing. Final image (names settling "like seeds") resonates non-literally with "truth is tension," though the diary’s explicit line risks thematic echo without full dramatic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "obsidian lagoon like a pupil staring up," with rhythm modulating from lyrical to fragmented under pressure. No POV slippage; the zeppelin’s drift and retrocognition are filtered through archivist’s tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with phrases like "kelp ropes, brittle shells of messages never sent," though "cipher of grief" edges toward stock metaphor. Final image avoids overwriting with precise verbs: "spoke the names aloud, letting them settle into the water like seeds."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in retrocognition as embodied archive-work, transforming "unburied truth" from metaphor to tactile process. The obsidian lagoon’s memory-liquid reframes witness as active collaboration, avoiding derivative magical realism through concrete debris mechanics.</comment>
