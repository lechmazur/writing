<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's embodied contradiction—hiding a bullet while believing in "bronze music"—drives every choice; her micro-decisions (tracing symbols, pressing amber to chest) reveal a hierarchy of values with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: elders protest while the youngest mason embraces "deliberate becoming," crystallizing the mountain’s healing as active negotiation, not passive victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Volcanic springs constrain every action—the obsidian shelf demands scarred knees, ferns shield heat—and charge the final bell image; environment isn’t backdrop but active pressure shaping Lila’s tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (tradition vs. evolution) tightens through Lila’s agency: decoding the kite forces a physical/emotional trade-off (painful retrieval), with elders’ resistance proving the cost of change is immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—weapons melted into bells, embryo tasting air—not abstraction; final bell image reweights "destiny" as ongoing negotiation, avoiding moralizing while charging every prior symbol.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Lila notices "ferns gossip," moss spells translations; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("steam rose like ancestral breath") to urgent ("pried at the obsidian") under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("A sudden gust snapped the reeds") while advancing plot; "chlorophyll courage" slightly elevates register but fits magical realism’s texture without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-war tropes through specific, lived detail: "implanted destiny" isn’t fixed prophecy but a child fluent in "leaf and stone," synthesizing reconciliation with biological urgency in an inevitable, non-obvious arc.</comment>
