<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (hoard/share knowledge) drives action; embodied emotion in "kissed it coolly like releasing a child" shows parental protectiveness toward the breach. Micro-choice of shifting stones reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "delayed disclosure" reconfigures integrity’s meaning while the planted tube forces stance crystallization. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase in "graphite sweet, leaf-flat, wrong" wind description narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brass tube constrains choice (only object tempting the follower) and charges final image as "garden's memory." Sensory specificity ("ivory and reflected lamplight," "wine-dark archway") evolves causally with plot while mirroring internal tension through tactile setting use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (share/hoard knowledge) tightens through protagonist’s lateral movement and stone-shifting choice, narrowing options to delayed disclosure. Cost legible in "kissed it coolly like releasing a child" but escalation lacks visceral pressure escalation beyond internal calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "integrity unfolding beyond her solitary tending" reweights quarantine zone as conceptual cost without moralizing. Theme emerges from "barometric pearls" to "slow migration of truth," avoiding binaries through Liora’s parental protectiveness toward the breach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines in storm-recorder lexicon ("barometric pearls," "ourobros tongues") with rhythmic control under pressure. "Tasting iron silence" compresses tension while avoiding head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during follower’s approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "feet slow, mind loud" creates minor metaphor collision in high-pressure beat. Strategic density excels ("progressing laterally" motif), though one paraphrase loop ("nurturing integrity... integrity in solitude") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine trope through meteorological lens ("electrified rain sample," "weigh the sky" instruments). Emotional specificity in "parental toward the breach" avoids genericity, though "rogue zone" phrasing risks template proximity without the storm-recorder angle.</comment>
