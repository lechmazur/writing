<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when outrage stirs despite her trained rationality; micro-choices like etching lines with the stylus reveal hierarchy of values (truth over comfort) with visible cost in the blood-welled fingertip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: her walk "outward" while recalling the king’s inward deceit crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (blood mirroring the dragon’s tongue), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through the reassembled vellum pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The copper stylus—wedged beneath the tray—constrains choice by enabling the floorboard etchings that map moral erosion; its bright tip charges the final image as truth’s persistent tool against verdigris decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation deepens through protagonist agency: arranging scraps into a spiral transforms knowledge, narrowing options to persuasion, with cost legible in her blood and the wind’s "hollow echoes" mistaken for truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the dragon’s scarlet tongue mirroring her blood drop; avoids moralizing as the final whisper ("Truth also wounds...") reweights the king’s lies via embodied cost, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "rain that pooled like dark mirrors"—selective, biased noticing; rhythmic control under pressure via compressed diction ("Her pulse steadied") as she confronts the plague lie.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "a mouth of iron teeth" exemplifies textural specificity with propulsion. Final line’s "petals fall" recharges the rosebush motif without figurative muddle, achieving crystalline closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "noble lies" trope through granary/plague specifics; the vellum scraps’ exponential deception pattern feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional truth in truth’s "cleaner" healing despite wounds.</comment>
