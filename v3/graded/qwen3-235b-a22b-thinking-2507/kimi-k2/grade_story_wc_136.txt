<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through the phantom punch’s physicality, but the internal tension between mapping as control versus self-harm lacks mid-scene friction despite powerful closure; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak yet could heighten contradictory impulses during the train ascent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the fortress collapsing into the punch bearing a heart-shaped hole reconfigures meaning with visceral cost ("stardust settling into cracks"), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through relentless motif density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The phantom punch functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (gate-punching) and charges the final image, but the starlit vault’s atmospheric pressure remains observational rather than tactically constraining the journey’s critical decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative density—cracks widening to spiral, fortress as "silence shaped like one"—narrowing options via visceral cost (erased bad habits on stairs), though the "hour dividing habits" timeframe’s live-clock pressure isn’t leveraged beyond initial symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mapping metaphor’s reversal ("hurt is also the compass"), with the final image reweighting the premise through stardust arrows pointing inward—no moralizing, yet the mother’s confession slightly over-resolves the central ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("analytically artistic" folding maps into ravens) and rhythmic control under pressure shine, with purposeful elision (truncated ending) taught early and paid off in closure’s crystallized ambiguity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-zero loops and high density propel momentum, but "analytically artistic" repetition in paragraph 6 creates a minor scaffold; no figurative muddle, though the "cracks healed except one" finale risks over-polish without sufficient grit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ingenuity in transforming mapping tropes through visceral specificity (birthmark-matched seats, punch-as-heart) feels inevitable, though the "fortress of unspoken truths" premise borders on familiar emotional architecture without radical reconfiguration.</comment>
