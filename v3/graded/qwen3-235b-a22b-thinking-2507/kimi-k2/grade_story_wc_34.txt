<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as Lira's silence battles urgent need; embodied in brush-tapping lullaby rhythm and throat tightening at ghost's revelation. Final choice to sing earned through bolt plate's accumulating weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence was different now—full instead of empty" reconfigures meaning with visible cost in "weight of articulated needs humming inside." Accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bolt plate constrains every choice—from pressing cloudbloom to becoming lantern—and charges final image where "each step left a pressed flower in the air," transforming mist into tangible memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's escalating encoding under lightning/thunder pressure; ghost's demand "Sing now" forces irreversible articulation. Cost crystallizes as bolt plate's humming weight forecloses silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt plate's metamorphosis: "articulate unspoken needs" becomes "pressed flower in the air," rejecting tidy morals for resonant image where silence transforms into "living, breathing art."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "marble that floated like a raft" and "quicksilver paint beading like dew"; rhythm modulates from hushed encoding to storm-driven urgency without losing lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "glyph was a note in the tinkersong wonder" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. One minor register drift ("tinkersong wonder") in high-pressure beat avoids closure impact, limiting to 9.4.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through concrete encoding mechanics; bolt plate's evolution from relic to lantern to trail-maker feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, as city hums the song below.</comment>
