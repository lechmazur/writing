<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (mourning vs exploration) drives pivotal choice to sketch rather than cross threshold; embodied emotion ("confusion pooling like ink") avoids labels; micro-choice to align compass with slowest star crystallizes agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: chronometer flickering while Captain Lys smiles reconfigures dilation as doorway with felt cost (exile transformed); causal lens holds through sketching compressing centuries; orientation anchored by "03:17 ship-time" in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Compass rose constrains every key choice (aligning stars, pressing on chronometer) and charges final image ("warm against my palm"); relativistic deck gradients physically alter movement ("seconds for me became hours for her"), not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (join refugees vs find solution) tightens when crossing threshold risks "eternal hesitation"; cost legible as chronometer digits flicker back to life; agency-driven escalation through sketching compressing timelines under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "turning confusion into exploration" shown via sketching sequence compressing centuries, not stated; final compass image reweights "true north" as will without moralizing; avoids thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct navigator voice ("vector of my own acceleration," "photon’s journey into centuries") modulates under pressure; perceptual signature filters all detail through chronometer/star-chart expertise; no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts: "confusion pooling like ink" slightly overwrites but justified by sketching motif; every sentence multiplies purpose (e.g., "brass trembled, then spun" advances plot, character, atmosphere); rhythm accelerates during threshold crossing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time dilation trope through specific synthesis: family sketching ritual as solution engine, compass rose as time-containment device; "true north as direction of will" twist feels inevitable yet fresh; bold risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
