<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in mirror confession ("words she'd swallowed") with embodied cost (wet reflection), but secondary pressure lacks depth without on-page townsfolk interaction during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "Mirrored Hush" tavern renaming reweights truth's cost. Wind chime exhale crystallizes stakes with visible cost in her aligned photograph stack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sapphire label constrains choice (triggering mirror vision) and charges final image (passing between hands). "Scabbed-over wounds" roofs integrate setting with thematic cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening via mirror confrontation: speaking confession forecloses silence path with visceral cost (twelve-year-old voice). Agency pure but pressure deepens under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through photos' shift from private burden to communal artifact; "no faces twisted in terror" avoids moralizing while answering "we were more than disaster" without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("porches glistening like wet teeth") and rhythmic control peak in mirror scene. No head-hopping; lexicon stays warden-specific ("levee stones mortaring").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "slow heartbeat" lantern simile extends organically to wind chime. Final line's "voices rising" avoids cliché with concrete propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Flood trope transformed by "precisely humane" photos and sapphire label's conceptual weight. Risk-taking in mirror truth conduit feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
