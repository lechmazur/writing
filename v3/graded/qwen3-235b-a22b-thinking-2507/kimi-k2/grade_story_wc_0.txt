<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (studying violent collapses yet seeking quiet erosion) drives micro-choices like spectral analysis of wings; humility feels earned through embodied details ("brushed soil from her knees") not abstract epiphany. Final renunciation of "loud endings" crystallizes with visible cost in the ashen specimens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "change was neither sudden nor gentle; it was simply continuous" with undeniable conceptual cost—her neutron-star precision humbled by imperceptible erosion. Accumulative lens holds: dust patterns deepen the dominant stake (measuring gradual loss) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice: broken roof dictates specimen decay, irrigation drip marks time, milkweed planter supplies evidence. Dust on wings charges the final image—ashen specimens in field case proving photonic erosion's irreplaceable role in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mara realizes the chrysalis decayed *in place*, deepening the erosion theme beyond initial wing collection. Agency in her spectral analysis shifts knowledge (gradual photonic loss > acute trauma), with humility as felt cost that alters her stance toward colleagues' "supernovae for spectacle."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from dust patterns reweighted in the final image: seedlings threading debris crystallize "continuous change" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality—the lullaby metaphor earns resonance through twelve specimens' color gradient, not abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in scientist’s diction ("photonic erosion," "frequency map") modulating under pressure; "motes drifted like slow comets" compresses lyricism without sacrificing clarity. Zero register drift during emotional peak ("decay can be a lullaby").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "dust on the wing recorded a smaller collapse" does triple duty (image/theme/action). Final line’s "roof beams sagged like tired shoulders" crystallizes closure with zero figurative muddle—propulsion intact through high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics/butterfly ecology avoids tropes: "photonic erosion" reframes decline as measurable process. Risk-taking in quiet closure (no butterfly emergence) heightens stakes—seedlings prove change’s continuity without false hope.</comment>
