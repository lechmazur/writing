<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for "captivating the city" remains poetic but psychologically thin; the final choice (accepting belonging as resonance) lacks visible internal contradiction before the birth chart vision. "Softly ingenious" is labeled rather than embodied through flawed decision-making under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the childhood bottle vision folding "into her chest like a second heart" crystallizes cost through irreversible identity absorption. Orientation anchors ("flooded corridor," "cracked dome") establish setting by word 20, satisfying Accumulative/Textural lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains every choice: bioluminescent algae stitches darkness for navigation, water shivers when feather touches socket, eastern light scattering fireflies forces ascent. The observatory dome’s "constellations rippling across ceiling" charges the final image of belonging as internal resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: her "shared exhale" triggers fireflies, palm-on-screen choice turns ash to ember. Cost is legible in the vision’s "second heart" absorption, but urgency lacks visceral friction until the birth chart reveal narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "belonging is not possession but resonance" crystallized by fireflies writing "new lines across her skin." Final image ("belonging is a place that waits inside") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "silt into slow galaxies," "starlight refracted through fathoms" filters cosmos through astrologer’s lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Light bloomed outward, corridors glowing like veins of molten pearl") heightens the climax without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "softly ingenious" repetitions (three uses); "fireflies rose from cracks... spiraled upward" slightly loops description. No figurative muddle in peak beats—phoenix ash turning to "ember" and "molten pearl" corridors sustain density without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms underwater trope through astrologer’s lens: "phoenix singing city to sleep" and "stars learning to swim" feel inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes, but feather’s magic borders on convenient without prior rules established for engineered beetles.</comment>
