<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority embodied through dust-as-memory and arrowhead pulse, but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; transformation into tower feels earned yet passive without active choice during crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (face cracking, pulse rooted), but early lens ambiguity with "paradox her teacher died before explaining" slightly weakens Accumulative drive coherence by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Towers of bone directly constrain choice (came "not to cross") and charge closure; dust-as-micro-setting shapes tactics (mortar in joints), though "canyon of endless echoes" edges generic in initial description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s passive reception rather than agency-driven escalation; crystallization cost is felt, but pressure lacks active struggle against the paradox during critical realization beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through dust/bone motifs reweighted at closure ("pulse found home in stillness"); avoids moralizing while crystallizing "navigate without moving" through concrete transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("appraise sky through flock patterns") with rhythmic control, though "historically reverent" repetition risks tic-like uniformity under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical density excels ("heartbeat older than language"), but "historically reverent" recurs 3x and "centuries of layered dust" 4x, bordering scaffold in high-pressure beats without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "stone skimmer" trope via bone-map transformation, though "towers of bone" echoes mythological archetypes without sufficient distinctive grounding beyond the dust motif.</comment>
