<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as Elara’s fear of emptying herself through chronicling clashes with her healing gift; embodied cost when naming burdens makes ribs "press against" her. Corin’s guilt for surviving is concrete, not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: leaving burdens for the temple’s seed carries visible cost (Corin’s first unguarded smile, Elara’s lightness). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—stellar pulses and glyph rearrangements tighten pressure without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram constrains choices (alignment with Betelgeuse) and charges the final image (pulsing seed). Observatory’s brass orrery evolves into temple pillars, making setting a living constraint that reweights closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara and Corin naming burdens transforms variable stars into fixed constellations. Cost is visceral—Elara’s "library of other people’s pain" pressing against ribs forecloses chronicling as isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shared burdens" made concrete: glyphs rearrange only when wounds are halved. Final image (planting the seed) reweights the temple as memory without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "orange fibers" and "wavering glow" through a chronicler’s lens. Rhythmic control peaks when "stars stutter their code," compressing stress without disrupting voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "petals trembled, releasing a whisper" shows rather than tells. Near-miss: "a library of other people’s pain" risks abstraction but anchors to ribs for embodied cost. Final line’s "feeling lighter" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "shared burdens" trope through brass orrery/temple fusion and spectrograph mechanics. Emotional specificity in Corin’s sister’s laughter filling the observatory avoids generic grief, making the solace earned.</comment>
