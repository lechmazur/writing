<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the storyteller’s shift from fearing the diamond’s "curse" to recognizing it as instruction; embodied cost is visceral as copper veins harden into grammar-mapping filigree during translation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: bone towers crumble while phonetic dust settles on her shoulders, crystallizing the language’s death yet lingering texture—a Resonant Reconfiguration under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tunnel’s echo mechanics actively constrain choices—her quiet articulation harvests phonemes from slick walls—while bone towers resonate and crumble as causal consequences, charging the final image of canyon exhaling words to stars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly under accumulative pressure: the sunset deadline forces her to translate textures into sound before echoes thin, with visible cost in cooling veins and crumbling towers that foreclose preservation through physical transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—translating feather cuts into consonants—not moralizing; the healed diamond and ordinary post-collapse speech offer non-literal resolution to "how language lives beyond death" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: textures named as hushed phonemes, moonlight refracting through diamond fracture; under pressure, syntax compresses ("Sound crystallized, a pure note that held the taste of river stones") without losing rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "Wind threaded through them, coaxing out the last living vowels" advances setting, conflict, and atmosphere in one stroke; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like translating "feathers cutting air into the precise rasp of a consonant."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "dying language" trope through specific mechanics—bone towers as phonetic archives, diamond fracture as lexicon—while emotional truth anchors the risk: copper veins hardening into grammar maps feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
