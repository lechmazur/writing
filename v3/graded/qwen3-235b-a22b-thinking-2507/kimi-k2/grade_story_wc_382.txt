<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "laugh felt rehearsed" and "neither of us had truly known"; embodied emotion via wax branding memory into skin. Final renunciation of passive listening for being "spoken through" earns closure with precise cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "fluency is not speaking but being spoken through" reweights language with seismic cost ("wax branding memory into skin"). Accumulative lens holds through brick vibrations to cosmic meteors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Seal constrains every choice—from sugar-borrowing prop to interrogation tool—and charges the final image ("period at the end of an unfinished clause"). Verbena and parapet aren’t backdrop but active grammar shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: pressing seal to wall ("I asked the wall what it remembered") narrows options to becoming conduit. Cost crystallizes in "wax branding memory into skin" and the seal’s promise-weight in pocket.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "agreed upon lies" evolving from social lubricant to foundational truth ("language... made of agreed upon lies that have outlasted the liars"). No moralizing; cosmic meteors reprice silence as verbs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "bricks conjugate the future imperfect" and "cornices flexed like eyebrows" reflects linguistic worldview. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure: "centuries slid beneath our knees" compresses time without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "wax branding memory into skin" achieves high density with visceral propulsion. "Limestone inflections" avoids purple prose by serving the Accumulative lens—every image constrains the interrogation stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "talking to buildings" trope through linguistic precision ("conjugations of slate"). Meteor shower rooftop interrogation feels inevitable yet fresh; "borrowed time" kettle reweights sugar motif with emotional specificity.</comment>
