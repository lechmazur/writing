<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the coachman’s silence versus grief-driven offering of his daughter’s memory; embodied emotion (“throat tightens”) avoids labels while micro-choices under pressure (rowing harder, offering memory) earn the closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the bead’s warmth and the gutters emptying crystallize the cost of distilling grief; the accumulative lens holds throughout with fog/needle motifs deepening stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (threading memories) and charging the final image; river’s physicality (“percolates through my ribs”) mirrors emotional state without cliché, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the woman reveals she’s “to unpick the knots,” forcing the coachman’s agency in offering the memory; visible cost in “gutters emptying” and the river erasing their wake reweights the dominant stake under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the palimpsest metaphor without moralizing; the bead’s glow reweights prior sorrow as distillable essence, avoiding sentimentality while offering a resonant answer to grief’s complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (“lantern swings, its flame a closely attentive pupil”) and rhythmic control (“rain begins to tick... spelling regret”) deepen under pressure; elision of backstory taught early pays off in the memory-offering beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; “spindrift serenity” risks overwriting but earns density through character-specific perception; final line’s “fresh ink on palimpsest of night” crystallizes accumulative lens without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ferryman trope via yarn needle as grief-distillation tool; emotional specificity (“rain gutters stop ticking”) avoids generic sorrow, with the bead’s creation feeling inevitable yet fresh in hindsight.</comment>
