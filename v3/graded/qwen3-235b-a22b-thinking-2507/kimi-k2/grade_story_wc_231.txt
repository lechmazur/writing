<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (isolation vs communal burden) act simultaneously in the dock pacing scene; final renunciation of solitude is earned through the Edelweiss-triggered memory with visceral cost in crumbling petals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when he pins the Edelweiss to the railing—"petals scattering like snow" crystallizes the cost of memory-bearing under the Accumulative/Textural lens held since midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (Edelweiss) constrains choice by triggering the alpine memory at crisis point; the opal dock's dissolving horizon actively pressures his observation method, charging the final image where it "fades into darkness."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation as gaps multiply; keeper's agency in "pouring memories into vessels" forecloses solitude with felt cost in the flower's decay, though escalation leans slightly receptive under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of "alpine sunlight and a boy’s last laugh" resonates as non-literal answer to grief's transfer without moralizing; theme emerges through Edelweiss scent and gap-counting, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bruised opal" sky, "taste salt and iron") and rhythmic control peak during memory gasp—"image vivid as a wound"—with patterned elision taught early via negative-space observations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lantern swinging like a slow heartbeat" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; minor cadence dip in "He closes... He touches... He stands" sequence prevents 10.0 despite otherwise flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through "observing gaps" method; Edelweiss-as-memory-conduit feels inevitable in hindsight. Lighthouse keeper archetype slightly familiar but redeemed by specific alpine/salt-world tension.</comment>
