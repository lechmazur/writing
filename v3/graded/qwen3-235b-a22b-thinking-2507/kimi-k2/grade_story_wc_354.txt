<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in the dented stone's tactile map; micro-choices like placing the knight reveal hierarchy of values. Minor deduction for prince's backstory feeling slightly summarized rather than dramatized in present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "the dent in his stone caught the returning light, transforming flaw into facet." Accumulative lens holds throughout, with eclipse phase tightening pressure without causality breaks. Orientation clear by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus actively constrains choices ("each footfall measured against shifting polarity") and charges final image. Micro-setting of the worry stone dent deepens meaning across beats, evolving from failure symbol to redemption catalyst without ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael's agency under Accumulative lens: placing the knight crystallizes stance with visible cost (dent deepening). Dominant stake—finding beauty in failure—is pressured by eclipse deadline and charged through tactile correlation of stone/knight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the final line "every dent tells the story of how we learned to see" reweights exile without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in the knight's physical correlation rather than abstract declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translating silence," "hurt to perceive directly") modulates under pressure. Keeper's voice slightly less differentiated in "weight of stones speaking to stars," but rhythmic control in high-stakes beats ("dent deepened, matching the knight's angle perfectly") compensates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "the hopeful melancholy remained, but now it sang instead of wept" achieves high density with resonant cadence. Minor overwriting risk in "hurt to perceive directly" avoided by immediate payoff in tactile navigation mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy and magnetic phenomena transforms exile trope. Emotional specificity in "hopeful melancholy" avoids generic templates, though the covenant keeper archetype borders on familiar without sufficient distinction beyond her function.</comment>
