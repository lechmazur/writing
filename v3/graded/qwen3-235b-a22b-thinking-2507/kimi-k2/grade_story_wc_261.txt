<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied specifics like "tongue tasting of iodine and regret," but brother's absence weakens motivation depth; final renunciation feels earned despite minimal secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with cost ("bandaged hand with clean linen of acceptance"), but "meteor hush" final line lacks visceral cost imagery to push past 8.8 under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hourglass shard functions as micro-setting constraining choices (pressing to scar), charging final image; tower's evolution from mourning to sighing provides perfect environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via coffee-ring memory triggering action, but Mara's agency feels passive—driven by plant prompts rather than active choice—limiting escalation depth under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar/coffee-ring/hourglass triad without moralizing; "silence of her own heart learning to read stories in scars" delivers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "green static" veins and coffee-ring readings; rhythmic control under stress ("blood welled, bright as sunrise") avoids lyric overindulgence in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "bright as sunrise" blood edges toward overwriting in high-pressure beat; otherwise impeccable density and propulsion serve Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic plants with hourglass trauma creates emotional specificity; "displaced miracle" redefinition through bodily action avoids abstract novelty.</comment>
