<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s fear of betrayal through selective memory versus her eventual surrender to unwanted truths, embodied in "taste of antiseptic corridors" writing. Final choice earned via shadow-measurement micro-choices, though "preemptively nostalgic" trait lacks active constraint on decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: obelisk becoming a page with "crowded names" crystallizes the cost of remembrance, reconfiguring the archive’s purpose under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in "ink bleeding into the monument" and "silence after bells were gone," with persistent shadow constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt and shadow measurements function as micro-setting that charges the final image—the obelisk absorbing the page. Sensory details ("rain softened the ink, turning letters into bruises") are selective and urgency-filtered, with tools (quill, parchment) constraining choices throughout the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: shadow-length pattern deepens until obelisk’s impossible "thirty-three stones" forces reckoning with excised plague memories. Dominant stake (truthful remembrance) tightens through Lira’s agency in measuring and writing, with felt cost in "unmarked coffins" altering the archive’s very purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—writing plague memories becomes the resonant answer to "sculpting identity," reweighting prior fragility. Avoids moralizing; the final image ("obelisk itself became a page") answers the central question without abstraction, embracing complexity through "layered lament" rather than triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" phrasing and shadow measurements. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("ink-stained fingers flicking her summer quill"), with lyrical compression taught early ("preemptively nostalgic") and paid off in the final hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density where "rain softened the ink" does triple duty (sensory, thematic, plot). Minor register drift in "conjectured" (slightly academic for archivist under stress) prevents 9+, but propulsion remains flawless through the obelisk revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory-archivist trope through shadow physics and "void that refused erasure." Fresh inflection in obelisk as excised memory manifesting as impossible shadow, with risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightening stakes without obscuring the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
