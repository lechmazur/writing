<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional embodied emotion (fear as crimson, wonder as gold) avoids label-speak; micro-choices like angling glass reveal value hierarchy. Lacks contradictory impulses in climax—final chord feels inevitable rather than contested—missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "golden droplets fell, no longer frozen" shows cost of emotional labor while reconfiguring silence as visible melody. Accumulative lens holds—density of color-emotion mapping tightens stakes with each fork placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains every choice: glass walls refract light, frost dictates emotional mapping, lemon tree's silvered bark enables sap-thaw imagery. Final droplets "composing a quiet melody" charge closure with setting-as-character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Rowan's agency—fork placements deepen emotional translation—but the converging chord feels slightly unearned; room's response lacks causal link to his final heart-touch. Cost (frost retreating) is visible but escalation misses hairline precision for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "unshaken marvels" reweighted when bird stirs without song. Final horizon lights answer "how could ruin still cradle life?" non-literally. Avoids moralizing; "dark now looked like a song" resonates without explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "frost-numb palms," "heat-caterpillars of emotion" filter world through Rowan's tactile grief. Near-9.0 deduction for "rectifying his riotous inner ocean"—slight academic drift in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "indigo folding into violet" shows textural density without muddle. Minor deduction: "steaming the air around memories" risks abstractness, but "crimson curling above wrist" instantly grounds it. Closure beat immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse trope through specific physics: soundless snow as "mute syllables," forks mapping emotion via color. Risk-taking (music sans sound) heightens stakes; "dark looked like a song" crystallizes vision without gimmickry.</comment>
