<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("courage gone unused so long it had turned feral") embodied in the boy’s frayed leash and whispered "Stay," with micro-choices like flinching at the star stamp revealing visceral conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the stone’s warmth and thread of light crystallize options with conceptual cost ("Stay" as courage), landing under Accumulative/Textural lens through atmospheric density shifts, with the final wave "argument" reweighting the vigil’s endless stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ticket punch’s star stamp constrains choice (marking "where fear ended") and charges the final image (glowing on pulse), while the leash’s physicality ("frayed end," "cracked leather") evolves from tether to catalyst for the boy’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: the lullaby’s density increase ("voices braiding until fog swayed") and cadence shift at the stone reweight the dominant stake (unused courage), with the visceral cost of "Stay" altering the boy’s tactics for the path ahead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the stone’s transformation: naming "Stay" reweights courage as embracing fear, avoiding moralizing while the "echo of lullaby" in waves offers resonant closure without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("knew tides by salt in joints," "shoreline lullaby learned from gulls") filters all description; rhythmic control peaks in the boy’s approach ("coat too thin... eyes wide as harbor mouths") with compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("lanterns swaying like slow metronomes above the fog" does triple duty for rhythm, setting, and theme) with no figurative muddle in the high-pressure stone scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms vigil trope through specific logic: courage waits only when named by "the name you fear most," with the braided kelp leash detail creating freshness that synthesizes theme and setting organically.</comment>
