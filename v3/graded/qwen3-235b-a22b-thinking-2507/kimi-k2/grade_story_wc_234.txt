<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Liora's epiphany feels unearned despite vivid embodiment. Micro-choices (crushing vial) align with motivation but lack struggle against her core flaw—bottling time was never shown as a genuine internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the helix reconfiguration and "density of presence" cost. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned escalation: ember sparks → liquid gold mirror → living-light lattice, each deepening the density concept with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (columella curl) constrains every key choice: alignment with sun, cracking, mirror creation. Basalt tiles drinking violet/copper directly charges the final image ("ordinary basalt" now holding afterglow), satisfying 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density accumulation (vials → shell → lattice), but the reversal lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Cael's whisper resolves the conflict too neatly; Liora's agency in "revaluing" feels reactive rather than earned through prior struggle with bottled time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: crushing the vial embodies "presence not captured but chosen." Final image (columella curl as "portable" pulse) resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire premise through concrete particulars like phosphorescent dew on skin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("palette of resolve," "scientifically romantic") modulates perfectly under pressure. Minor register drift in "residual heat, a map of every dusk they had stolen" slightly distances POV during high-stakes shell-cracking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with masterful propulsion; "shadows lengthened backward, folding into themselves" crystallizes concept through rhythm. One scaffold phrase ("warm from the day’s last light") slightly pads the opening beat without advancing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "bottling time" trope through alchemical specificity (pocket-suns, columella curl). Risk-taking heightens stakes: abstract "density of presence" made visceral via liquid gold mirror showing younger selves, avoiding generic emotional arithmetic.</comment>
