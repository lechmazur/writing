<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lyra's hesitation about "which dreams she was willing to lose," but "purposefully curious" remains abstract without deeper embodiment of the trait's cost during memory surrender.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when scars rearrange into the sigil, with visceral cost in surrendered memories braiding into the seed; Accumulative lens holds through escalating density of light/memory exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt glade actively constrains choices—the eclipse "mouth closing" forces action, while scars function as micro-setting charging the final image; "glass-grass" dissolving into "moonlit pollen" reweights the covenant with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as the maze grows around Lyra with "yesterday’s suns," narrowing options under eclipse pressure; cost is unmistakable when memories weave the new covenant, though "anxious elation" slightly softens emotional friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sigil-as-map reconfiguration; final line ("tasting anxious elation... first word of a new language") offers resonant non-literal answer to "where abandoned futures go" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "boots crunching secrets" and "tasting anxious elation," with rhythmic control during memory release; minor register drift in "purposefully curious" slightly dilutes peak-beat authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "purposefully curious" repetition risks abstraction in high-pressure beats; "braided into the seed" avoids figurative muddle while advancing closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological covenant with temporal mechanics (orbital mirrors stealing light); "seed of darkness" as folded impatient futures transforms tropes through specific, lived-in stakes in the glade’s restoration.</comment>
