<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (worrying drawer pull, showing it to the boy), but secondary characters lack contradictory impulses; Raglen/Della remain functional archetypes despite strong status dynamics during exchanges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: mist thinning and cooling metal crystallize the cost of endurance with visible behavioral shifts (Raglen’s tenderness, grain sacks), though lens inference (Accumulative/Textural) isn’t explicit until midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parapet’s "slick teeth of stone" actively constrains movement and choices; mist’s "furrowed hush" evolves from atmospheric pressure to symbol of shared vulnerability, charging the final image where the setting literally widens post-exchange.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the name dispute escalation, where the drawer pull’s history forces stance crystallization; cost is legible in Raglen’s nod and Della’s unsolicited grain, though the dominant stake (humanizing exchanges) isn’t sufficiently tested until late.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the drawer pull’s tarnish symbolizing shared history; avoids moralizing by showing "recycled wisdom" through Della’s grain sacks, though "names of hunger" risks thematic echo without sufficient subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist combed... cold fingers," "coins of breath") modulates under pressure; voice remains consistently character-bound with rhythmic control during the name dispute standoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful fragments ("Listen, I said"), but "cold fingers" cliché and "names of sovereignty" abstraction slightly muddle peak tension; no loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner exchange trope through the drawer pull’s specific history and "furrowed hush" texture; avoids derivative safety with morally ambiguous exchanges (grain sacks as unsolicited penance), though Voric/Estaran dynamics feel slightly schematic.</comment>
