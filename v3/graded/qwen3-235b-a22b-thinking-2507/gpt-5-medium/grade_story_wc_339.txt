<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction in "unwilling to pretend stability" versus smoothing letters like a child's hair, but the "quietly analytic" trait lacks embodied struggle against grief's weight during high-pressure moments like the line tug.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("time for air and sorrow"), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks decisive intensification—the line tug resolves too cleanly without altering tactics or deepening the physics-of-letting-go premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The snow globe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (tapping, pouching) and charges the final image ("second chance at weather"), meeting the 9+ gate by making "letting go" tangible through glass fracture and flakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("understand physics of letting go") is signaled early but pressure never coheres; the "cost of drift" is observed intellectually rather than paid through irreversible action, missing the band guardrail for visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("paper sighs when water lets it go"), avoiding moralizing while the final image reweights "letting go" as active preservation—not surrender—via the snow globe's return to light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "capillary in glass" observations, but "reference frames" phrasing drifts into academic register during peak pressure, slightly marring rhythmic control under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid propulsion falters only in the final paragraph's simultaneity error ("ship fell away... and my gauge told me"), slightly dulling closure's visceral impact despite otherwise flawless density and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms salvage work into grief physics via the snow globe's "domestic planet" metaphor; risk-taking in quiet closure ("time for air and sorrow") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
