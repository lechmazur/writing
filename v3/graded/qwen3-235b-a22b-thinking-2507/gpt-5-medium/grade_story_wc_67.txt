<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mother's porcelain-cracked eyes and the protagonist's ash-scattering method show embodied contradiction, but motivation for truth-weaving lacks visceral friction beyond abstract duty. Final wrist-squeeze closure earns cost through "surviving without a witness," yet internal conflict between filial duty and artistic truth feels under-pressured until the gallery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the chair rocks autonomously amid breathless quiet, crystallizing the mirage of safety with undeniable cost in "cost of surviving without a witness." Orientation is flawless ("rocking chair slows to stop" anchors within 15 words), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ash-density escalation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rocking chair functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure—its "tired metronome" rhythm bookends the story and literally moves during the final beat. While the gallery's spatial choreography is vivid, the chair’s physical presence ("lift it, hearing faint rhythm") directly shapes the protagonist’s tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-telling without shattering safety) tightens meaningfully when mother nods toward the letters, forcing the powdering choice. But pressure lacks visceral escalation—the "last night" deadline creates abstract urgency without narrowing options; cost feels conceptual rather than embodied until the gallery’s breathless quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: kintsugi mask fault lines, unsent letters as pigment, and visitors "filling gaps with their own ghosts" avoid moralizing. Final image ("danger cannot bear to be named outright") reweights the mirage concept non-literally, crystallizing how love and fear blur in the chair’s rhythm without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "paper dust, a smell like singed sugar" and "light catching [mask] fault lines like tiny rivers," filtering trauma through an artist’s tactile lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—fragmented sentences during ash-scattering versus flowing cadence in gallery scenes—teaches and pays off the lyric compression without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "I mix ash with binder until it moves like dusk across metal" compresses action/image with zero scaffolding. One minor paraphrase loop ("storm of names dissolving into faces" / "crowd that will not be named") avoids penalty as intentional pattern, but no figurative muddle touches the closure beat’s crystalline simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes through the ash-scatterer’s specific methodology—powdering unsent letters into pigment avoids therapy-speak clichés. The risk of abstract closure pays off: the rocking chair’s autonomous movement feels inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes through "safety as lullaby until the verse broke" without gimmickry.</comment>
