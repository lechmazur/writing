<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when admitting fear of "perfect restoration erasing hands that kept living," directly conflicting with restoration mandate; embodied cost visible as wall preserves underdrawings. No diagnostic labels, only sensory-driven micro-choices like rolling the nickel to time breath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: narrator's fear of erasure is answered by wall keeping "underdrawings" visible while "final image gleams without forgetting." Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (echoes triggering layered awakenings), cost legible in "lighter step" earned by surrendering certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices: parabolas force reflection method ("through reflected sound I could bewitch the binder"), and final image charges closure as visitors' words return with "figures' laughter." Micro-setting (hobo nickel) directly shapes tactics like timing breath via "cricketing rhythm."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single stake (certainty vs curiosity) tightens through protagonist agency: each echo query ("who loved her?") deepens mystery, culminating in visible cost—admitting fear of erasure—which alters the mural's outcome. Pressure escalates via pattern breaks (vine greens "in the pause"), reweighting restoration stakes with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the mural's layered revelation: final image of "map keeps unfolding" reweights prior material without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo. Earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle ("fear that perfect restoration erases hands"), resisting tidy resolution by preserving "underdrawings" as whisper.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends conservation expertise ("binder," "varnish") with poetic compression ("pigments woke like eyelids"). Under pressure, syntax tightens ("In the pause... colors woke") while maintaining voice consistency; lyric elision (time jumps) taught early via "at dawn... by afternoon" without loss of causal clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every line propels meaning ("pulses folded like birds wheeling, pigments trembled"). Figurative language clarifies pressure (ash moved "like daylight"), avoiding muddle. Final line's "map keeps unfolding" avoids cliché through specific prior anchoring in grandfather's coin.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms restoration tropes via sound mechanics: garden's parabolas aren't backdrop but active tool that "bewitches" varnish. Emotional truth in specific details (grandfather's "needle file" carving), avoiding abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
