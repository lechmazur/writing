<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when thinking of failure moves the compass; embodied emotion in "gloomy cheerfulness curling in mouth" avoids abstraction. Final renunciation of certainty for kindness/gravity earns change with felt cost ("riddle unclench like a fist").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity" reweights premise after the riddle unclenches. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through resonant image density; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Seashell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (aligning stars with bruise) and charges final image (blushing beneath chipped stars). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: cello vibrations over fog details during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening density: cello vibrations accumulate meaning until conceptual repricing. Cost unmistakable in "riddle unclench like a fist" and shell cooling. Stakes tighten through "tide drags answer away" deadline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final "kindness/gravity" image reweights prior material non-literally without moralizing. Theme emerges through crooked bow answering "why truth hates straight lines," avoiding thematic echo. Epiphany earned via concrete struggle with cello vibrations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gloomy cheerfulness like a raincoat") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early ("truth climbed onto shoulders"). Minor deduction for "throat full of star-dust" bordering overwritten.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "bow shivers as if wood recalled rain" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves meaning throughout. Deduction only for "wind decides to stay human" slightly violating physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting as resonant retelling transforms tropes through specific logic (compass moves when thinking of failure). Conceptual integrity in vibrations carrying truth; avoids safety middle with "stitched smile" harmony.</comment>
