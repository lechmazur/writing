<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in present action; grief drives choices monolithically despite rich backstory. Miren's memory informs but doesn't create simultaneous tension in the naming ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("new corridor of work"), but the felt price of naming Shoreless lacks embodied specificity in the final beat despite strong Accumulative lens adherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory mechanics are indispensable: the lens focuses light to crystallize fears, and the atlas page taped to it actively constrains the naming process, charging the final scythe/star image with irreplaceable tool logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when Miren's voice appears, tightening pressure through the reaper's agency, but the cost ("no triumph") doesn't visibly alter his method—tomorrow's work remains identical, missing a subtle tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Shoreless" crystallization: "names are agreements, breath shared until walking becomes possible" earns its resonance via the atlas page's transformation, avoiding moralizing while reweighting sacrifice's echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("dome breathed like a sleeping lung"), but minor voice convergence occurs in the "glass creatures" repetitions during high-pressure beats, slightly diluting rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless prose suffers slight paraphrase loops ("names were bridges that held"/"names are not cages") and three near-identical "glass creature" references, creating subtle scaffold in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as cartography elevates the reaper archetype; "Shoreless" as fear of "vacancy between hands" transforms sacrifice tropes through specific, irreplaceable emotional calculus.</comment>
