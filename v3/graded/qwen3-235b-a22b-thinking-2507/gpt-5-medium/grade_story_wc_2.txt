<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "uncertainly certain" and water-crossing choice; embodied emotion avoids labels. Slight abstraction in "value of traveling without certainty" borders on epiphany without full physical grounding at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "clock of water" crystallizes the water-crossing cost with conceptual repricing. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through waterfall rhythm study to final draft. Journal reveal slightly convenient but earns payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Waterfall functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (studying spray rhythm) and charges closure via the water-clock mechanism. "Vines misted the glass like unspoken breath" filters setting through tinkerer's sensory bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (exactness vs. living irregularity) tightens when compass points behind waterfall, forcing agency: "I did what brass teaches: improvise." Cost is visceral in the spray rhythm crossing, altering tactics toward water-clock assembly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: water-clock assembly answers "chase exactness, not fidelity" without moralizing. "When coincidence becomes pattern" reweights meaning at closure via compass navigation, avoiding thematic echo despite journal quote.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is airtight: "time flinches when touched" and "spray's rhythm" reflect tinkerer's embodied cognition. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during waterfall crossing) with zero register drift or scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "each droplet struck a spoon" demonstrates peak information density. Minor overwriting risk in "constellations, each point folding like an eyelid" but metaphor serves closure logic without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms clockmaker trope via water-clock synthesis: "rewound itself into gentle mechanical whispering" feels inevitable yet fresh. Avoids derivative premise through specific brass/water mechanics and admiral's drought backstory.</comment>
