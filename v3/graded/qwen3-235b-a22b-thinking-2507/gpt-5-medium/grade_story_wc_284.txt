<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Ansel's "prudently daring" calculus and scarred embodiment; micro-choices like tracing snow messages reveal hierarchy of values. Final ring acceptance earns change through prior causality, though "courage practiced not spent" risks thematic echo without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Ansel discards microfilm but accepts exile's quiet endurance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the snow messages and pillbox details accumulate pressure toward this reconfiguration. "Bones of decision knitting" crystallizes the cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The pillbox functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (tracing messages, holding ring) and charging the final image as Ansel slips it onto scarred skin. Sensory specificity ("snow accepted work with artisan's patience") avoids cliché while mirroring internal thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ansel's agency: discarding microfilm reconfigures his options from retrieval to trust-based renewal. Cost is legible in the physicality of "ring moving over old maplines" and "silver hush renewed," though the single tightening lacks deeper escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—pillbox weight, snow pressure, ring symbolism—not abstraction. Final image reweights "unused courage" as quiet endurance, but "courage practiced not spent" edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath held between seasons," "snow collapsing under fox weight") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control in high-stakes beats ("Boot for numbers, cane for letters") avoids scaffold, though micro-dialogue risks over-lyricism without sufficient tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("He kept it because the dead demanded witness"). "Ash-fine letters sliced small" exemplifies textural specificity, though "precarious pledge tonight" borders on stock phrasing, slightly dulling early momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through embodied specificity—courage as "circle moving over old maplines," not heroics. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, coded snow) heightens stakes coherently, with the pillbox's evolution feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
