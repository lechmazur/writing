<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("patience in my mouth") and micro-choices (planting spike), but contradictory impulses lack sufficient friction during pivotal moments like the goddess encounter where motivation remains steadfast rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when "I lifted the spike and let the map spill back into the tide," reconfiguring the coast's fate with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation to the constellations' examination.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rail spike functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (transliterating emotions) and charges the final image, though the sound wave garden's atmospheric richness rarely actively pressures tactics until the dune planting scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density increase ("waves rose into antlers") under Accumulative lens; protagonist's agency in voicing silence forecloses hoarding the map, with conceptual cost (returning the coastline) legible in the spillage image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars like "silence that does not sleep but devours," avoiding moralizing; the final map-spilling action resonates as a non-literal answer to the coast's erosion without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ripples of bass and hush") and rhythmic control persist under pressure; non-standard punctuation serves voice, while "voicing silence" mechanics deepen tension without elision penalties.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "waves rose into antlers and broke into petals" risks mixed metaphor; final image clarity avoids closure artifacts despite lyrical intensity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic and sonic physics avoids derivative templates; risk-taking in "sleepwalking constellations" transforms tropes through specific mechanics like "tidepools shaped like ears" without obscuring stakes.</comment>
