<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through "panic paddles my ribs" versus "becoming stillness," with micro-choices (unsnarling line, corking vial) revealing hierarchy of values. Sister reflection slightly exceeds BRR but alters present stance via lilac memory fueling signal transmission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: temple fading "like a star at noon" crystallizes rescue with felt cost ("slow weight of depth feels suddenly like a hand"). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through density shift at signal transmission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal vial constrains choices (memory-triggering during panic) and charges final image ("small bell of collected silence"). Depth pressure and stone teeth actively shape tactics, with sensory hierarchy reflecting urgency (silt swallowing lamp into "bruise of brown").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: "override instinct" becomes active tactic narrowing options (kicking/clawing vs. stillness), with visible cost in "gauge needles inch toward warning." Time pressure tightens decisively at "pop the vial's stopper" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("temple fading like a star at noon") reweights "lonesome splendor" without moralizing, showing rescue coaxed from "what refuses to be held." Theme emerges through vial's emptiness carrying gravity, avoiding abstraction via concrete scent-memory transmission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "bruise of brown" for silt, "shy animal trained to prayer" for hush. Rhythmic control peaks in stillness sequences ("becoming a single held note"), with patterned elision (no dialogue) taught early and paid off in closure's resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("exhale through my teeth, shaping emergency tones like a prayer taught backward"). Figurative language serves pressure ("stone teeth scrape my tank"), with final line recharging "lonesome splendor" without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm varies masterfully.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: perfume vial as signal conduit transforms rescue tropes through sensory specificity. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "gathered hush" reweights physics into emotional logic, resisting generic "underwater mission" templates.</comment>
