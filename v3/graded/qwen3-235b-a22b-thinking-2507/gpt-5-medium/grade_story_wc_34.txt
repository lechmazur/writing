<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("songs were louder, but no truer") and embodied emotion ("throat answered, thin and trembling") deepen micro-choices like bolting the plate. Lacks visible flaw-driven mistake that compounds before resolution, slightly weakening causal earn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks with "Windows were lungs..." reconfiguration. Cost legible in "bruised perfume" closure image. Minor deduction as ghost's cooperation feels slightly convenient without prior friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Courtyard-as-body micro-setting constrains choices (encoding on walls) and charges closure ("courtyard started to pulse"). Bolt plate's transformation from heirloom to "tuned rain catcher" exemplifies 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via storm pressure and ghost's responsiveness, but escalation leans on ghost's sudden cooperation rather than protagonist's agency alone. Cost ("bruised perfume") is felt but not fully earned by balladeer's prior choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "body as city" metaphor without moralizing; final image ("hinge, opening what hurt") resonates non-literally. Avoids thematic echo by showing "open the vents" as concrete action, not abstract plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "notes walking softer than my feet"; rhythm modulates perfectly under storm pressure. Patterned elision (ghost's voice implied through valve blinks) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Dashes leaned toward circles..." uses concrete verbs to advance story. Minor density risk in "tinkersong wonder" justified by later "tuned rain catcher" payoff. Zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via code/graffiti lens; "thirst that learned to sing quietly" achieves emotional specificity. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
