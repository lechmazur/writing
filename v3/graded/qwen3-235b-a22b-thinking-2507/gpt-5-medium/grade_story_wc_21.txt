<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "motive simple and ruinous" pursuit of truth amid trauma; grandmother's appearance deepens without breaking causality; final endurance ("half-retrocognitively trapped... walks forward") earns visible cost through prior debris-arrangement choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable social cost: "a city learning to read itself aloud, each breath a restored margin" reweights historical erasure under Accumulative lens; pressure builds through pattern density (debris → diary → lagoon visions) with legible cost in "cannot breathe" reverie.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("obsidian vow beneath the dunes"); driftwood arrangements constrain choices (mapping marches, absences) and directly shape the closure's "restored margin" resonance through tactile debris use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through archivist's agency: debris patterns trigger diary reactions, kelp signal summons clerk; cost crystallizes in "rearrange the debris into names" with surf reading them "with difficult tenderness," altering tactics via irreversible revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "bodies misnamed as disturbances" and "ledger anyone can read" avoid moralizing; final image reweights historical truth without stating a moral, embracing complexity via officials facing signatures while city "speaks, a music that was always there."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("civic songs," "pens hover like gulls starving") modulates under pressure; non-standard punctuation serves voice; retrocognition stays focalized without head-hopping even during grandmother's appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("topography of defiance spelled in refuse") propels momentum; no figurative muddle in peak beats; final line "each breath a restored margin" recharges opening undertow imagery with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil-rights archive via floating zeppelin, truth-seeking through debris arrangements; specific details ("punches for a stenograph") ground universality; emotional truth in "half-retrocognitively trapped" duality avoids generic templates.</comment>
