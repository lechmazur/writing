<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("promise was light... now lead") with embodied grief ("bubbles brief as unfinished inventions"). Micro-choices like cistern plunges reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Final soldering earns endurance through prior causality, though "sharpened hope" slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "tiny rivers of gold flicker like exclamations the sea cannot dissolve" reconfigures grief into action. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (statue pockmarks, acid sea) until engine activation names absences, narrowing options from doubt to mending. Cost proof is crystalline in the seams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acid sea and statue actively constrain choices: cistern plunges edit fear, pockmarks dictate engine mechanics. Final image ("pontoons rising as acid forgot hunger") charges the closure through environmental reconfiguration. Micro-setting (golden seams) embodies theme without overt symbolism, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting grief through mending) tightens accumulatively: each measurement deepens pressure until engine names absences, forcing crystallization of stance. Protagonist agency drives escalation (fitting charm, narrating logic), with cost legible in soldered seams charging the final image. Band guardrail met via tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete actions: kintsugi shown via soldering seams to "gild where it teaches," not stated. Ending reweights prior material with "statue's pockmarks glow[ing] with sourceless starlight," offering non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by focusing on "pattern of her choosing."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("night rusted with green fumes," "calipers kissing each crater") modulates rhythm under pressure. Elision (Mira's fall) taught early and paid via engine's revelation. Zero POV slippage—every detail filtered through alchemist's grief ("solvents to smell of her wrists"). Meets 9+ quick test with flawless rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density throughout ("hands smell of salt and solder, tremble with kintsugi intentions"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle ("bells tremble as if language were a small hammer"). Final line avoids cliché with "low music keeps me from the edge." Peak beats (engine activation) maintain clarity amid lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: steampunk workshop as grief metaphor, memory engine as kintsugi for trauma. Emotional specificity in "cracked enamel moon" and "miscounted bolts" avoids tropes. Bold accumulative structure trusts sensory accumulation over plot; closure reconfiguration (engine naming absences) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
