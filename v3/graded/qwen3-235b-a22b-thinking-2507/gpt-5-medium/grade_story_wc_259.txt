<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "refusal felt like a smaller betrayal than acceptance," but the child's sudden appearance lacks causal setup, slightly weakening the final choice's motivation despite strong embodied emotion throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the lake releasing images and "anguished joy" reweighting the archive's purpose, though the child's introduction on the third landing lacks causal anchoring, creating a minor causality ripple in the escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bronze pagoda and lake-ceiling function as micro-settings that constrain choices (sideways stairs, compass direction) and charge the final image; "atoms of nostalgia" evolve from dust motes to lantern seeds, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density ("names that refused to die") and pattern avoidance, but the archive's "losing grip" occurs too easily without visible cost until the climax; the conceptual price of "anguished joy" lands late but resonates powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "permissions to feel honestly," avoiding moralizing until the final line’s "love is what restores the city" edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned ambiguity despite strong particulars like the queen’s humility coins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("twilight was a verb," "tasted sweeter than safe bread") and rhythmic control under pressure are flawless; non-standard punctuation serves voice without confusion, with compression taught early and paid off in the closure’s lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "breathe until it tasted of vowels" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. One minor density risk: "avoiding patterns so the names could not chain themselves to fate" slightly muddles syntax in a high-pressure beat but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive-as-living-entity with "compass pointing to yesterday’s mistake" feels inevitable; avoids tropes through specific details like scholars laughing in anguish, though "end of innocence" phrasing risks familiarity without its unique ramp metaphor.</comment>
