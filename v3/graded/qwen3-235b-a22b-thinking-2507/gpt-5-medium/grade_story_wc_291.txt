<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via prosopagnosia ("faces are countries I cannot map") and embodied grief ("lance down, and grief also rises"). Micro-choices like threading the ribbon reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Diagnostic label ("Prosopagnosia is the term") slightly mars peak beat but is immediately redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the painting's "blue ribbon floats like a bridge" reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("I do not know who harmed her"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; mist-to-ribbon horizon image crystallizes the Earned Stasis with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry mist functions as active micro-setting, constraining choices (lancing silt) and charging closure (ribbon horizon). The blue ribbon's kink becomes indispensable texture—its "twist back into a bow" directly shapes the final image's empathy bridge. No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: physical evidence (ribbon, phone case) deepens into conceptual breakthrough ("What if Mara came without the fox"). Agency drives the "unifying opposites" pivot; cost is crystallized in "I do not know who harmed her"—a visible limitation that forecloses certainty while enabling the painting's resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the blue ribbon's journey from "stubbornly wrong" fragment to bridge image answers "how to awaken dormant empathy" without moralizing. Final confession ("fear met gentleness... both stepped back") avoids sentimentality by embracing ambiguity, making the cost undeniable through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is airtight: "I draw the way riverbeds remember water" filters all observation. Rhythmic control under pressure shines in the quarry investigation ("Lance down, and the bar met something that clacked"), with purposeful compression taught early ("Cold cases are the rooms where echoes go to practice speech").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels meaning. "Grief also rises when pierced, slow and sulfurous" exemplifies high-density prose—metaphor clarifies physical/emotional stakes without muddle. Final line "To awaken dormant empathy" charges closure with crystalline precision, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: prosopagnosia as investigative method transforms cold-case tropes. The "unifying opposites" framework feels inevitable in hindsight, grounding abstract empathy in concrete acts (ribbon trade, painting). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—the faceless portrait approach redefines resolution.</comment>
