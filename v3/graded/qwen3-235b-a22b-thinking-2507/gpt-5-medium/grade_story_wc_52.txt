<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in carving the collar—not lion or face—while embodied grief permeates micro-choices like refusing to sand the knot. Final renunciation of restoring the name tag earns visible cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via the name-tag notch: "absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness" forecloses restoration with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with steam/kettle rhythm tightening pressure toward this crystallized refusal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ash wood carving blank functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when the knot becomes "a tiny scar" she shapes through tactile labor. Final image of the cloth bundle on the sill charges closure by merging tool, environment, and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation manifests as density increase: rain-beaded skylight evolves from atmosphere to "crystallized time" lenses that freeze the world, narrowing options to the carving’s hinge. Cost crystallizes in the un-restored name tag’s absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the collar’s evolution—from "curve that once knew his throat" to "notch where a tag once hung"—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "here and gone" into tangible absence without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in character-specific details: "ropes hang like molted skins," "kettle hum thickens." Rhythm modulates with grief’s cadence—slow carving strokes versus the kettle’s "small growing animal of sound."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Each shaving breathes up, curling like the old whiskers" merges action/image. Minor register drift in "rust-hued peace" slightly jars widow’s voice but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific, tactile logic: carving a collar instead of a lion, honoring absence via the name-tag notch. Emotional truth anchors universals in ash wood grain and rain-freckled glass.</comment>
