<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through sensory mapping profession; "fear is a scent and I can sort scents" embodies contradiction without labels. Slight over-articulation in "I do not forgive" risks therapy-speak but "fold her into the chart" salvages it with concrete action. Micro-choice of redirecting breathing to "map the ache" crystallizes value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: "I have measured the truth, found it heavy" forecloses erasure with visceral cost ("smell, heavy metal and rain"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; "green light spilled" sequence reweights fuel redirection via patterned repetition. No causality breaks in universe mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repair bay functions as micro-setting: hanging chains' echo informs parallel selves, coolant frost affects movement. Shard constrains choices (terminal interface) and charges final image ("green as planetfall"). Sensory selection narrows under pressure ("smell was my doorway tonight") while avoiding checklist tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) tightens through sensory deepening: "smell of ozone" → "weight arrived as a smell." Agency drives escalation via coordinate splicing; cost crystallizes when protagonist accepts "redirected my breathing and mapped the ache." No second character needed for this Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "a map that lies becomes only decoration for ruins" rejects moralizing. Final image ("redirect the lost, one heartbeat per world") reweights "REDIRECT" non-literally with survivor guilt. Avoids false binaries via mother's "hatch bolted by love and terror."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "maps are not lines, but scents" establishes voice. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during button press ("hiss, spark, chain of exits"), flowing prose in reflection. "Cyclically spontaneous" motif taught early with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ozone and rain" refrain deepens meaning. "Green as planetfall" avoids cliché while "bending closer, and learn the first curve" slightly abstracts but ties to mapping motif. Sentence rhythm accelerates during fuel redirection sequence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes via sensory mapping: "weaving between worlds" tied to tactile charting. Emotional specificity (survivor guilt refracted through glass) avoids templates. "Prayer wheel" tools show fresh inflection of setting-as-pressure rather than generic decay.</comment>
