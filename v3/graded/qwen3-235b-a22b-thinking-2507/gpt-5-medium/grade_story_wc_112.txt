<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jae's motivation to prove sideways time is embodied through micro-choices like pulling the lever despite surge warnings, with "felt forgiven" showing earned complexity; minor deduction for limited interior contradiction during crisis beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with "felt forgiven" and physical repairs showing cost; Accumulative lens holds through magnetic nexus escalation to the manta return's double shadows; orientation clear by "frost smoked off solar arrays" (line 1).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Station-as-harp and ozone vault constrain choices (lever operation) while "cold salt and new paper" final image charges closure; micro-setting (bolts, visor) consistently filters perception without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving sideways time) tightens via lever pull that risks station integrity; cost legible in surge damage repairs and emotional "felt forgiven"; biologists' cheer feels slightly convenient but not resolution-breaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mantas' lateral wake and "shadows crossing twice," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights time's fluidity with "cold salt and new paper" offering non-literal resolution to temporal isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct "icy warmth" voice permeates sensory details ("breath pulled sideways through ice"); minor deduction for "mechanically warm promise" momentarily drifting from Jae's lexicon during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "compasses ticked like trapped insects" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; "choir of delayed selves" edges toward overwriting but pays off in closure resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via xenobiology lens ("oil on water" timestamps); "shadows crossing twice" reconfiguration feels inevitable through prior particulars without derivative echoes.</comment>
