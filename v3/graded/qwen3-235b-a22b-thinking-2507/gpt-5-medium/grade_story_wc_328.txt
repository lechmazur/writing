<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "spoke aloud the mission I kept quiet," where scientific rigor clashes with emotional vulnerability. Final choice to say "yes" as keeper feels earned through embodied micro-choices like planting the arrowhead, avoiding diagnostic labels while showing "bitterness" transforming via concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "frostbitten hope that never thaws," crystallizing the protagonist’s surrender under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure tightens via sensory accumulation (seedlings moving like compass needles) without causality breaks, making the metamorphosis both inevitable and charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arrowhead functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (pressing to ear, planting in soil) and charges the final image (cracking to reveal names). Bulbs’ "gravitationally playful rhythm" evolves with events, directly altering tactics during the singing climax where seedlings "stood up like citizens."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: planting the arrowhead narrows options, forcing the singing climax under the harmony’s pressure. Cost is unmistakable in "we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness," where physical transformation reweights the dominant stake of reconciling observation with surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—turning bitterness into "a cosmic joke" evolves from abstract mission to lived reality via the arrowhead’s sprouting names. Final image avoids moralizing while reweighting prior material: "frostbitten hope that never thaws" answers the central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "real notes rode in my bones" and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats ("I sang until my throat tasted like tin"). Voice modulates from clinical ("catalog in mind") to transcendent ("windless choir throbbed") without head-hopping, teaching its pattern early through sensory precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines like "Roots climbed the masonry like fingers learning Braille" achieve high density without muddle. Final line’s "frostbitten hope that never thaws" crystallizes closure with crystalline propulsion, though "laughter kept my cover warm in the cold rooms" risks minor thermal dissonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms cryptid tropes through specific emotional calculus—"cosmic joke" avoids cliché by grounding metamorphosis in bitterness’s physical weight. Risk-taking (surreal harmony) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable when the arrowhead sprouts handwriting containing names.</comment>
