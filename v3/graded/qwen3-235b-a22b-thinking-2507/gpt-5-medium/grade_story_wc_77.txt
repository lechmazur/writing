<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene (fear of non-existence vs. intellectual agency); final renunciation of fear's power earned through "unbosoming" truth with visible conceptual cost in shadow's dissolution. No diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "unswerving attention is the solvent it fears" reconfigures stakes via Accumulative lens. Final image makes cost undeniable without physical act. Orientation anchored by 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Abandoned funhouse constrains choices (plywood lips as lock, wobbling pedestal) and charges closure ("slit of daylight disguised as crack"). Lingering luminance physically affects vision ("tears showed angles"), reweighted as solvent in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's paradoxical writing deepening the dominant stake ("afraid I do not exist unless looked at"). Conceptual cost ("unswerving attention is solvent") unmistakable in shadow's dissolution, though pressure lacks one persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics ("photographically cursed" identity erosion), not statement. Final image reweights "lingering luminance" into solvent of fear, offering resonant non-literal answer to "rules for fear" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath had repulsive allure of sweet rot") with rhythmic control under pressure; advisor's dialogue ("chuckled like paper tearing") contrasts protagonist's synesthetic lexicon. No head-hopping; patterned elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("ribs clicking" conveys pain/temporal dislocation). Final paragraph's "name swam back into my face" avoids cliché. Minor deduction for "wink of contradiction made page breathe" slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "fear confrontation" trope through photographic mechanics and carnival logic. Specific details ("grandmother kept dream dictionary in bread tin") prevent abstraction; final reconfiguration subverts expectation with emotional specificity.</comment>
