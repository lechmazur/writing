<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the thief's duality (stealing to return) but "luminous disbelief" risks abstraction; embodied emotion falters slightly in mentor's reunion where "lake's worth of unspent horizon" leans toward poetic convenience over visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "now I knew what I had always stolen" reweights the premise with undeniable cost (identity reframed), under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density tightens the dominant stake through the moonbeam jar's transformative action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emerald station's green tiles actively constrain choice (path revealed by moonbeams on tiles), and the jar charges the final image; micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere by making the environment a functional tool in the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (interpreting flowers, using moonbeams) under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the mentor's "unpaid silence" becoming embodied presence; the single deepening (redefining illumination) sufficiently narrows options to crystallize stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "illuminated moments are not light, but the astonishment that light allows" reframed by portraits waking in truthful darkness; final line offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moth-read bouquets," "sun folded its burning map") shines, but "hush-hushed alphabets" slightly drifts into forced lyricism; rhythmic control holds under pressure though minor register inconsistencies appear in reflective passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with high propulsion; "bitter and clean" scent description is the sole near-cliché, but final line ("felt the old craft reinterpret itself") achieves crystalline clarity and density without muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "portrait thief" trope through specific emotional calculus (stealing "fragile edges where moments cling"); fresh synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, though "destiny's door" slightly echoes familiar motifs without full transformation.</comment>
