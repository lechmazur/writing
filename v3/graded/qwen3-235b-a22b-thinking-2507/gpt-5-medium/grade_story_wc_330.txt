<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the carpenter’s silent nature versus his pivotal song; embodied emotion via tactile work (sanding radii) avoids therapy-speak. Slight abstraction in "interpret silence as possibility" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the carousel’s turning reconfigures silence/song with felt cost (his broken silence). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the oasis discovery’s motivation lacks a visible stumble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned train actively constrains choices (tracing wires, oasis discovery) and charges the final image ("wore the day"). Water tank micro-setting directly enables the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from mechanical failure to existential voice; the carpenter’s singing choice narrows options with clear cost (shattered silence). Pressure intensifies through the oasis discovery’s causal chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the halo fragment’s evolution and final image ("silence and song felt negotiable"), avoiding moralizing. Slightly weakened by early abstract phrasing of "silence as possibility."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tool roll unspooled like a manuscript of patience") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats (singing in the oasis). Zero head-hopping; tension modulates voice perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "coaxing spindles from stubborn knots the way a singer coaxes a held note into bloom" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language intensifies pressure without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms restoration tropes via tactile specifics (halo fragment, water tank oasis); emotional truth in the carpenter’s quiet persistence avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
