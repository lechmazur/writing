<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "joyful sorrow" is label-only without embodied tension. Advisor functions as symbol, not character with pressure. No visible flaws driving mistakes—Arin’s process is serene, not contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise ("song remembers you") with conceptual cost of being forgotten, but escalation lacks deepening—bell swing is single pressure point without narrowing options. Orientation clear, but Accumulative lens shows static density, not intensifying pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor constrains choices: tide washes pencil marks, moon enables "stain of light" for bell permission. Camera and pencil as micro-settings charge closure ("bell of unstruck light"). Sensory hierarchy masterful—"rope sighs," "barnacle glitter" embody Arin’s perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating silence) signaled early, but pressure doesn’t cohere—disruption of quiet lacks resistance or trade-offs. Bell swing alters knowledge but no visible cost paid; conceptual cost of forgetting feels abstract, not dramatized in tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mapping silence" mechanics, not moralizing. Final image ("song remembers you") reweights being forgotten as conceptual cost without stating a moral. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars: tide lines, crab pauses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tide hummed like glass," "gull shadows" reflect Arin’s synesthetic focus. Rhythm varies with pressure—short phrases for bell swing ("soft enough to bend"), lyrical flow for mapping. No head-hopping; elisions (advisor’s whisper) taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("ledger entry of nothing" compresses metaphor/action). Figurative language precise ("ring through milk") without muddle. Final line’s "joyful sorrow" skirts label-risk but saved by embodied context ("smiling with... walked home").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "artist seeking inspiration" trope via sign language and no-film camera constraints. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—but "quietly charismatic" trait feels generic, slightly diluting emotional specificity.</comment>
