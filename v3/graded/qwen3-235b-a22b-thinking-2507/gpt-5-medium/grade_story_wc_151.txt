<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in patience vs urgency ("wait, because the last lesson is patience"), with embodied cost in "grit cling to my knees" and heartbeat simile; avoids therapy-speak despite high-stakes renaming.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly when the erased chalk mark reveals narrator's past, making cost legible through "my own hand" and the traced ear; Accumulative lens holds as density peaks with naming "Auricle" amid van sounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Golden arcade functions as micro-setting: chalk codes exploit low camera filters, constraining delivery method; final image charges the erased footprint where "the present leans into the past," making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as chalk decoding narrows options to "Auricle," with felt cost in the erased footprint; escalation peaks when busker's violin vibrates the clipboard, driving the naming choice under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "surface mail bears skin memory" versus digital speed, resolved not in moral but in the traced ear on the seal—a resonant, non-literal answer to how names carry truth without safety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes," with rhythmic control under pressure ("pen clacking softly... like a metronome"); elision of client's identity taught early and paid off in the anonymous receiver.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "heart loud as sorting machinery" exemplifies concrete propulsion. Minor deduction: "futuristic nostalgia" risks abstraction but gains texture through "echo" and "lover on a train platform" reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes postal work with poetic renaming into fresh emotional calculus; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes via chalk codes that feel earned, not gimmicky, with specificity in "machine violin" and counter stamps.</comment>
