<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Protagonist's "operatively gentle" hands embody contradiction under pressure, but secondary characters lack individuation beyond functional roles; general's admission of fatigue shows earned micro-choice, yet rivals remain types rather than individuals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: shell casings transformed into "witness rather than prophecy" reconfigures violence with conceptual cost; celestial timing motif pays off in "pulse" echo, satisfying Accumulative lens without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terrace stones' "cracked, flawed beauty" directly constrains signing (grief as "hand remembering heat"), while shell casings evolve from "unneeded today" to closure's "bitter bouquet," charging the final image with historical weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake "price of redemption" tightens through the soldier's "insult to dead neighbors" versus "prison" counterclaim, resolved by protagonist's agency ("work shared, not suffering hoarded"), but dissenters' presence never materially pressures the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ending's "we will be judged by how well our enemies sleep" reframes justice without moralizing; "use was the word that saved us" avoids thematic echo by emerging organically from children's testimony about water and safety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink carried the weight, so voices could lift") persists under stress; rhythmic control shines in "breathing in for regret, breathing out for bargaining," though "operatively gentle" repetition risks tic-like overuse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bitter bouquet of history" risks overwriting but pays off in closure; "burnished by years under unkind suns" skirts cliché yet remains voice-coherent for delegates' introduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transformation of shell casings from weapons to "witness" synthesizes ritual and redemption freshly; "ritual significance" method elevates beyond peace-negotiation tropes through tactile details like lemon-water "caution" and drafting "breathing."</comment>
