<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "do not rush to open" versus urgency of fireworks; embodied emotion in throat tightening at inherited promise. Flaw: single POV limits relationship dynamics per scope, but micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tuning frequencies instead of prying) earn high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "my throat tightens" crystallizes emotional burden of inheriting Anya's promise. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—the hush swells, tools resonate, and final image reweights silence with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: copper bowl and mothwing microphone constrain choices (non-violent opening method) and charge closure when clasp clicks. Recurring object (diary) evolves from "stubbornly sealed" to "breathing" freedom, directly shaping tactics and final image. Avoids white-room syndrome via tactile workshop details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: tuning frequencies narrows options as fireworks approach, forcing a single resonant solution. Cost is visceral in "throat tightens"—inheriting Anya's burden alters tactics (writing new entry). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: Anya's "silence is dough" metaphors avoid abstraction, while final entry ("teaches a heart how to approach without conquest") reweights empathy without moralizing. No thematic echo; cost is conceptual (inheriting unfinishable work), resonating through "rain withheld" imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "sky of rubbed graphite" and "moth lungs" filter world through acoustic sensitivity. Rhythmic control under pressure—sentences compress as fuse scratches dark ("holds its last second"). No head-hopping; voice modulates from theatrical to intimate without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "bowl hums... reed answers... mothwing waits" avoids cadence loops via subtle variation. Final line’s "tastes like rain withheld" delivers high density without muddle. Minor deduction: "confiding stage secrets for the kitchen" slightly strains metaphor coherence in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "acoustic archaeology of silence" transforms pacifism into tangible technique (tuning frequencies to open clasp). Emotional specificity in hospital/courtroom/kitchen silences avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes (mothwing microphone) without gimmickry, though workshop setting lacks transformative grit.</comment>
