<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("glowed with borrowed power yet questioned") and embodied emotion through taste metaphors feel authentic; final choice to carry Mirelle's story earns endurance with cost in "taste of alone returns." Mirelle's slightly archetypal presence slightly dilutes relationship-as-crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("I will carry your story") under Accumulative lens; sensory density intensifies coherently toward "final count." Minor deduction as cost remains emotional rather than visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tin compass ring as micro-setting constrains navigation choices and charges the final image ("taste of north changing to a pronoun"); lavender blades slicked by rain directly enable the "voting petals" motif. Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory deepening ("citrus near impatience, ash for memory risk") toward the convergence scene; cost is the narrator's skepticism yielding to belief. Agency feels authentic though the tradeoff between doubt and faith lacks tangible consequence beyond internal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("storms converge to be counted not conquered"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights the compass ring's meaning without stating morals. Mirelle's "sky belongs to the ground" line crystallizes subtext through character voice, not authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("wind tasted like pennies"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("static pop along the aurora"); voice modulates from clinical ("borrowed power") to lyrical ("violet breath"). Minor deduction for near-uniform poetic density limiting stress-induced compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "aurora combed the bluff in green teeth" exemplifies high-density imagery without muddle. Opening ("glowed with borrowed power") and closing ("taste of alone returns") resonate through charged specificity. No figurative artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms weatherwalker trope through taste-based navigation; "emergent compass" concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with sensory POV heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "terrestrially cosmic" slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
