<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (systematic work vs. faltering heartbeat) and embodied emotion ("taste salt and dust"), with motivation rooted in past failure. Micro-choices during mending reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Slight abstraction in "foxglove regret" as learned honesty prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: whispering own name tests forgetting with cost ("twin spices of relief that age leaves behind"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to mending climax. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost proof solid via final sensory detail.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: cloudskin moorings affect library stability, skylight quality enables crack detection, bamboo tube's fragility demands specific repair. Final image ("moon pays debt to sky") recharges prior material with conceptual cost. Micro-setting (chime tools) charges closure decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving escaping sound) tightens via wind's warning and crack's "trembling" during mending, narrowing options to immediate action. Cost legible in "salt and dust" taste after release. Escalation driven by caretaker's agency under Accumulative lens, though risk of failure feels understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "stitch openings closed without silencing truth" embodies stewardship. Final image (name traveling down to find lost letter) offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "spices of relief," though secondary complexity about memory's burden could deepen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catalog audible to the patient," dust "labeled with seasons") with rhythmic control: compressed syntax during mending ("I touch it, and the room inhales...") flows into lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly under pressure. "Foxglove regret" repetition feels intentional motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("wick a mothwing of cooled thunder" does triple duty). Figurative language consistent with voice, no muddle in peak beats. Minor deduction for "foxglove regret" appearing 3x, but motif integration prevents artifact penalty. Closure beat pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "sound of forgotten names" premise transformed via specific mending ritual (snail listening cones, glass-orchid petals). Emotional truth in "taste salt and dust" avoids quirkiness. Transformation test passed—swap "bamboo tube" and story collapses—but core premise slightly echoes magical library tropes.</comment>
