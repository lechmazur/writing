<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied somatic markers ("snails under fingertip's shadow"); contradictory impulses (trauma vs grafting resilience) act simultaneously during gull rescue. Final endurance earned by prior causality with visible cost in photograph's rehandling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: photograph "new only in the way his hands now held it, steady as a trellis" reconfigures opening fragility. Orientation anchors within 40 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through logbook exhibit's pressure accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arboretum actively constrains choices: cliff path for gull rescue, glass roofs requiring storm tightening, citrus needing "shy sun." Final logbook exhibit pairs tide tables with succulents, charging closure through environment-as-tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: helicopter-triggered freeze forces Leda's intervention ("Cut this knot, hold here"), narrowing options to somatic recentering. Cost legible in "loosening in shoulders like tide pulling away its claim."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "optimism meant doors, not denial" dramatized by grafting resilient plants and logbook exhibit. Final image reweights trauma via photograph's tactile transformation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature consistent: "ocean said nothing false," "leaves sweating" reflect horticultural POV. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Cut this knot, hold here") matching somatic urgency. Zero register drift during trauma flashback.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "skein of air snarling into old pitch of rotors" exemplifies precise metaphor density. Minor deduction for one abstract phrase ("anchor optimism in realism") in high-pressure beat. Final line's "work ready to meet him" echoes opening with earned weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms PTSD tropes through horticultural lens: "pearl of stillness" rooted in sternum sensation, trauma recovery as grafting technique. Fresh inflection in lighthouse logbooks as emotional weather instruments paired with succulents.</comment>
