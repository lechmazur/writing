<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied contradiction in "nod that pretended confidence" while stone hums reveals tension between fear and duty. Final endurance of "hammering repose" forecloses escape with visible cost in "hands remembered the motion."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via Accumulative/Textural lens: "bloom of hush" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("maps now held their hinge"). "Hands remembered the motion" proves felt cost; lens named by midpoint ("find quiet in storm") and held through closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (echo chamber stone) charges final image: "light answering my pulse" reweights tool from functional object to embodied extension. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under pressure—ice fractures read as "shy hieroglyphs" when stakes escalate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: examining ice cracks deepens knowledge, forcing trade-off between self-preservation and tending the bloom. Cost legible in "ribs clatter like thin cups" during energy beings' proximity, tightening tactics for the final planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "hammered repose" reframes resilience as active forging, not passive calm. Final image ("keep tending the bloom, stone in hand") offers non-literal answer to "where to be quiet" without moralizing, resisting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shy hieroglyphs of pressure," "tasted less brine, more sleep") filters all observation. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—sentence fragments ("I started by...") mirror crisis focus without head-hopping or lexicon drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "fissures were shy hieroglyphs" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor overwriting risk in "gently luminous folds of charge" offset by payoff in stone’s evolving function. Final line’s "reading ice for its next request" avoids closure-dulling abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "finding quiet" trope through geological metaphor and embodied cost. "Bloom of hush" as canceling waves feels inevitable yet fresh, resisting abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
