<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrator's interiority lacks concrete contradiction under pressure; "doubts softened like bread" feels abstract rather than embodied choice. Rowen's motivation clear but narrator's agency passive—no micro-choices altering tactics despite "one day remained" deadline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: mended bowls and revived candles show visible cost of alignment. "Alignment is consent" nearly slips into thematic echo but "hand and door agree" crystallizes it with tangible cost in the final earth-voice moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vine tendril constrains choices (tuning requires specific notes) and charges final image (glowing filament). Arbor's "dropping needles" pressures timing—environment directly shapes tactics during practice sequences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("fields muttering") but escalation passive: "one day remained" lacks urgency. Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens (density of sensory tasks) but no tangible cost until climax—missed chance to show failed attempts during practice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing through "bowls mended along cracks" and "crickets paused as recipe of relief." Final "repair is remembering together" risks thematic echo but saved by concrete "jars of notes warmed our pockets" charging the abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dew trembled into tone," "wax grew wicks like green tongues." Rhythmic control under pressure ("owl moved in daylight") with purposeful fragments taught early. No head-hopping despite single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor template cadence ("He said... He knelt... He taught") in middle beats. "Doubts softened like bread meeting warm palm" muddles metaphor. Final "earth answered in voice we recognized" rescues closure from earlier scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "restoring traditions" trope via breath-warmed notes and tendril-as-listening-tool. Fresh inflection in "remedies prefer collective hands"—specific synthesis of community action and moonlight that feels inevitable.</comment>
