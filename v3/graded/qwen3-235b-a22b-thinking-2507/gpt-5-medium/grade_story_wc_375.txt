<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (selling "quick smiles" vs. authentic art) act simultaneously in lock-struggle scene; final choice to sign Vera's name earns closure through prior causality with visible grief cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "something in me has opened that will not close" crystallizing reconfigured options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystal cave functions as micro-setting constraining choice (sketching lock on smoothest shard); violet shards charging with pigments directly charge final image's emotional cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening (lock resistance → drawing solution) reweights dominant stake under Accumulative lens; conceptual cost legible in "grief split" mechanism yielding to portraiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image "something in me has opened that will not close" offers resonant non-literal answer to artistic suppression; avoids moralizing while reweighting "inescapable callings" through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mnemonic gift" filtering observations) with rhythmic compression during lock struggle; elision of Vera's death taught through concrete cues (blank marble).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "black dust travels like pollen" avoids figurative muddle; final line "door beneath home" recharges motif with propulsion; no scaffold in high-pressure lock sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: unlocking creativity through artistic process itself (drawing lock to fix mechanism); risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring conceptual cost.</comment>
