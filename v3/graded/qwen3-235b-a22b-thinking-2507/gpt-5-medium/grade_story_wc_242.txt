<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (cultivating estrangement vs. assembling connection) manifest in micro-choices like looping calls without speaking. Embodied emotion shines when the glass disc "thrums without her touch" during crisis, avoiding diagnostic labels. Slight archetype lean in Rojo/Flora limits secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density (glass disc resonance escalating from tuning tool to emergency conduit). Closure lands as Earned Stasis—"Mara stayed standing"—with visible cost in perpetual estrangement. Third rail incident slightly coincidental but doesn't resolve the conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc (micro-setting) constrains choices by enabling Mara's looping method and charges closure when "fog on its surface clear." Tunnel's cable junctions supply critical resources (side door access). "Sleet across its eyes" slightly overreaches but doesn't undermine the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching endings to begin) tightens through the elevator emergency, driven by Mara's agency in looping calls. Cost is unmistakable in Rojo's abrupt hang-up and Flora's tears. Maintenance crew resolution edges toward coincidence but remains complication not solution under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the glass disc's evolution from "superstition" to essential tool. Final image ("endings walked down the stairs... learning there was someplace to sit") offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars like the pressed flower.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "wires purred like cats around her ankles" filters world through Mara's sonic sensitivity. Rhythmic control peaks in crisis ("Rojo talked about an old stairwell and how to hum so fear cannot hear you moving"). Lyric compression taught early ("calls came down like rain through a colander") pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flickering bulbs salted the dark with patient sparks" achieves triple duty (sensory/mood/metaphor). Only minor artifact: "melodically haunted" risks abstraction but redeemed by immediate embodiment ("humming when trains murmured past"). Final image ("wires purred like cats") crystallizes pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "misplaced connection" trope through occupational specificity (switchboard operator's craft) and the glass harmonica's functional role. Emotional truth in "cultivated estrangement" avoids sentimentality. Fresh inflection: wrong numbers as deliberate framework for teaching endings to begin, synthesized through prior particulars.</comment>
