<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "sorrow cools sharp" uses diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. Micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs despite strong sensory specificity in sensor calibration scenes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("click I do not hear still satisfies"), but riverbank backstory fragment risks orientation debt. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through frost-pattern cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains every choice: frost patterns dictate sensor flows, glass ribs shape heat mapping. Final image of reciprocal quiet charges the setting’s role in sustaining meaning after sound’s end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via protagonist’s algorithm rewrite, but cost ("refuse cheap drama of misread sadness") lacks visceral payoff. Agency shines in weighting forks with leaves, though grief’s "pooling" remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thermal language ("hope flickers like animal heat"), but final line’s "capsized world can learn to balance" edges toward thematic echo, reducing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in thermal vocabulary ("remembrance warms diffuse") with rhythmic control during sensor sequences. No head-hopping; compression taught early via "light answers" anchor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor template cadence in "Heat gathers... cools... mirrors herd" (−0.3), but zero scaffold in closure beats. "Lilies blistered" botanical inaccuracy avoided through context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and grief, but "unshaken marvels" risks trope. Risk-taking in thermal music pays off through concrete sensor mechanics, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
