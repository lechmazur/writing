<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied fatigue ("smile of someone who traded sleep for maps") and micro-choices like pairing "mouths to pots," but contradictory impulses lack on-page tension; the logistician’s sacrifice (mislaying name) is earned though underdeveloped in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger of kindness reweights "polite anarchy" with undeniable cost (logistician’s anonymity), holding the Accumulative lens; rain-soaked postcards and the moon rock’s legacy crystallize the shift from rumor to tangible reciprocity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station constrains choices (leaking skylight dictates candle routes), while the moon rock charges the final image as a "ledger of kindness"; sensory details like "rain that smelled like green metal" filter through the logistician’s urgent pragmatism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen as rain/power failure tests the "cure for loneliness," narrowing options to immediate reciprocity; the cost—logistician’s erased identity—is felt when they "quietly mislaid their own name" during the trolley arrival, tightening the accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "take now, return later" reweights into thermos returns, avoiding moralizing; the final ledger image answers "cure for loneliness" as shared burden, not miracle, through the moon rock’s legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rumor could catalyze the return of a train that only carried conversations and soup") with rhythmic control; lyrical compression ("order arrived as a kind of polite anarchy") taught early and paid off in the ledger closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gutters sang louder than the cellist" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent ("science of kindness moving reliably") but voice-motivated by logistician’s jargon, avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster logistics and loneliness cure via railway setting; transforms tropes through specific details (moon rock as weighted door-stop), though "cure for loneliness" risks familiarity—saved by the ledger’s tangible reciprocity.</comment>
