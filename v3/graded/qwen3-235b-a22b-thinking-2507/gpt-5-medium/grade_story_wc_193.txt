<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("virtuously mischievous," "scammed but crawled back") manifest simultaneously in micro-choices like selecting message threads; final console signing earns renunciation of financial trauma through prior causality of bolt ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "ledger of breath" replaces ruined ledger with conceptual cost, under Accumulative lens where pressure density peaks at filament appearance; no lens ambiguity despite parallel selves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent caps function as micro-setting charging closure—diamonds bloom "inside the caps" transforming prior "patient lanterns," while submarine bolt's threaded mouth constrains the pivotal screwing choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: choosing kindest message thread then turning chamber narrows options, with ledger transformation making conceptual cost legible during diamond bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of broken vs. kept promises resonates through concrete particulars—"IOU scars" dissolving into "ledger of breath"—avoiding moralizing; final image reweights premise without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air smells like hatching equations," "ghost alphabets") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in "harp string of pure intention" sustains Accumulative pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mushrooms pulse like patient lanterns counting my fright" achieves high density without muddle; final line’s "tidal and new" resolves opening tidepool simile with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms quantum tropes through pyramid scheme survivor lens; "pressure into diamonds" metaphor made literal via bioluminescent farm creates fresh emotional calculus where ledger trauma becomes "breath."</comment>
