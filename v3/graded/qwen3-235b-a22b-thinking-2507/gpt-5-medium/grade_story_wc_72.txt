<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Oris's contradictory impulses (statue/living, certainty/nuance) drive every choice; embodied emotion peaks when scholar's recoil "ripples" in Oris's mind. Micro-choices like threading eelgrass reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: "cascading revelations" escalate through density increase ("paving stones confessed their arguments") to Charged Poise closure where cost is undeniable—"scholar felt the delay in her bones and did not mistake it for fear."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Underwater garden actively constrains choices: water enables telepathy, structural weakness enables climax. Final image of "coral cushions" charges setting with cost—benches transformed from argument sites to patient waiting spaces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stake (certainty vs. nuance) tightens via protagonist agency: Oris threads ampoule "to speak slowly," forcing scholar's worldview collapse. Cost is visceral—"scholar's certainty reopened like a window after storm"—with no coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "bottled hesitation" to "benches arranged for argument"; final image offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Avoids false balance—scholar's rigidity is wrong without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silt rose like breath from stone lungs") with rhythmic control mirroring water currents. Syntax compresses under pressure ("I broke the tip with a wrist of coral, and time poured out") without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "anemones that wrote their astonishment in bubbles" achieves triple duty (action/image/theme). Final beat avoids figurative muddle—"swept the anemones, incisively kind" charges closure with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "underwater city" trope through specific logic: foxglove as "tempo," hesitation as strategy. Emotional truth in "delay as mercy" feels fresh; risk-taking (textural structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
