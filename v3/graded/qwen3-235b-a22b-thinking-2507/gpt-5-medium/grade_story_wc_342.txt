<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (urgency vs precision) drive micro-choices like testing paint limits; prosopagnosia shapes concrete perception ("edges and weights") without labels; final endurance earns closure through embodied struggle with visible cost ("building folds like a tent").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "dawn still glows on the bark" after demolition reconfigures meaning through art's endurance; Accumulative lens holds via dust motes, countdown, and layer-by-layer painting intensifying pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tree trunk constrains choices (hollow space navigation, growth rings as guide) and charges final image ("dawn still glows on the bark"); coin functions as micro-setting object that literally unlocks survival tactics; environment shapes every critical move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Demolition timeframe tightens decisions ("foreman grants one more minute"), forcing trade-offs between speed and precision; escalation via Accumulative pressure (dust tremors, radio countdown) reweights stakes until implosion; cost crystallizes in rubble versus enduring mural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory enduring emerges through concrete particulars (coin's weather patterns, breath-thin layers), not abstraction; final image "quiet as a pulse, bright as a promise" reweights destruction without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prosopagnosia taught me to see by edges") with rhythmic control under pressure ("Dust jumps. Shelves sway."); elision (vanished guild) taught early and paid off through letter; voice modulates perfectly from hush to implosion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("I test the limit of the blue until it fractures into chalk") with crystalline clarity; no figurative muddle even in complex metaphors ("vines imitate entire forests"); final line avoids sentimentality through concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "art survives destruction" via face-blind painter in tree library; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("fractally precise" coin arcs) makes premise inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
