<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in balancing "fear and release" under pressure; embodied emotion in "pigeons preen like small hearths" avoids therapy-speak. Final trust choice earns cost through prior betrayal trauma, but "counterfeit smiles" risks stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut" crystallizes cost with visible emotional reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds through dust-mote mapping; "blooming and withering" heart image reweights stakes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic functions as micro-setting: cedar glue smell and buckled ledgers constrain choices (e.g., copying hymns during clearance). Dust motes charge final image as navigational tool, though ledger details slightly over-extend occupational scope for tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through attic clearance pressure forcing final hymn copying. Agency-driven escalation in mapping dust for Lark’s route narrows options to one fragile trust choice, but violinist’s passive waiting slightly softens the cost legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "paper trails" transforming from chains to guides; final image of "pigeons carry us both ways" offers non-literal resolution to trust question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dust answers like a clock" and "bow keeps no secrets." Voice modulates under pressure ("gust kicks, skylight shudders"), though single-POV limits relationship dynamics exploration with violinist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fragile choir" and "bruised tulip" show textural specificity. Minor density issue in "ledger to margin, feather to fingertip" risks near-duplicate rhythm, but propulsion remains intact through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier pigeons as trust vessels transforms stock trope. "Mars meteorite chip" as doubt-calibrator avoids gimmickry through concrete use in balancing scales, though "reinvents personal history" borders on template phrasing.</comment>
