<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure shine: kneeling to listen through fingertips, conjecturing with hypotheses "perch like birds," translating gratitude while exchanging dialects. Embodied emotion avoids labels—"heat hums in a key between sorrow and laughter"—with contradictions woven into action, not alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "trust, the secret architecture under every useful disappearance" reweights path-editing as caretaking. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory accrual (seeds, pool, glass) to crystallize the shepherd’s "courtesy" with felt cost in the vanished path’s necessary absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The geode cave actively constrains choices: the pool’s coin-like surface forces seed-mapping, while "cheerful gloom" demands eye-adjustment to see the path’s gaps. Setting charges closure as the new path "stretches like a cat" within the cave’s humming echoes, making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: the shepherd’s vision reveals the path folded not from fear but "courtesy" toward the sleeping beast, narrowing options to scattering seeds as an alternate corridor. Cost is legible in the path’s "deliberately removed" gaps—a visible forfeiture that reshapes the recollectionist’s tactics toward "considerate caution."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: paths as "caretakers, not cowards" and "world edits its sentences to avoid a clumsy wound" avoid moralizing. Final image of the sea "feeling heard" resonates as a non-literal answer to why disappearances are trust, reweighting the entire premise without abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything: light "moves like patient fish," seeds "tremble faintly, translating cave wind into commas." Voice modulates under pressure—lyric density peaks during the vision bridge—while maintaining consistent lexicon ("crater glass," "transliterate"). Zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through layered imagery: "footsteps stop... with a shiver of decision" compresses cause/effect. Final paragraph’s rhythm ("A new path wakes, stretching like a cat") deepens closure without muddle. One borderline repetition ("cheerful gloom") deducts 0.2 but doesn’t dull the cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "missing paths" through specific, non-obvious logic: disappearances as "caretakers" avoiding "clumsy wounds" synthesizes ecological and linguistic insight. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—no confrontation, yet the sleeping beast’s "newborn sentence" feels urgent through concrete sensory pressure.</comment>
