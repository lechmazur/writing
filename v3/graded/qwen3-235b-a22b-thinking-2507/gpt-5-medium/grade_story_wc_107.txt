<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (caution vs creation) act simultaneously in pivotal moments; final renunciation of fear earned by tactile micro-choices like sealing the bookmark to glass. No diagnostic labels during high-stakes glassblowing despite physical strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "heart thaws when given purpose" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (technician's ghost, meltwater "like paper being forgiven"). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as narrated actions deepen pressure without causal breaks. Orientation anchored by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (melting ice mapping "new deltas across dust") directly constrains choices—wiping switches becomes "river redirection." Kiln's "gout orange" light charges the final image of vessels "clear enough to see through without fear."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake ("safe zones for inquiry") tightens through Arlen's escalating physical investment (shaking arms) and methodical narration. Agency drives every beat; cost ("arms shook") visibly alters tactics while meltwater's "metronome" intensifies pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete actions: "Safeness is not a wall... terror cannot find purchase" earns resonance via glassblowing. Final line reweights "thawing heart" as active purpose ("notice what hurts") without moralizing, satisfying Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glassblower's tactile precision ("turning the molten mouth with slow breath") modulates to lyrical cadence under stress. Rhythmic control evident in "drip fell like a metronome for questions"—zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "ice sighed and began melting" avoids cliché through unexpected verbs. Every sentence multiplies meaning ("narrated the rotation, the alignment, the cooling"). Minor abstraction in "thoughtfully spirited" compensated by immediate concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "safe space" trope through glassblower's physical craft: "vessels that could hold questions" reframes abstract concept into tangible objects. Risk-taking (science/tenderness fusion) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "ferreted flask that smells of brine" avoids quirky ornamentation.</comment>
