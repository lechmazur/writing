<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "heart, always on loan, stopped clicking for a moment and began listening"—embodied emotion driving micro-choices. Flaws lack deeper exploration beyond "borrowed heart" metaphor, limiting endurance complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("timed ourselves by wonder") lands with conceptual cost: "waiting tasted like cedar" reconfigures time’s meaning under Accumulative lens. Minor lens ambiguity early with garage-sale breadcrumbs slightly dilutes pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting—wheat ghosts and "seam" directly constrain choices (fragment placement, walking letters). Final image’s hum charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory deepening: garage-sale breadcrumbs narrow options to tactile rediscovery, culminating in "heel to toe" path with visible cost ("borrowed heart kept quiet"). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens with flawless cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—"spoons that weighed yesterdays," cricket as New Year—avoiding moralizing. Final image "follow the soft thunder" reweights time’s meaning non-literally, achieving perfect thematic resonance without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("charting pulses by smell") remains consistent under pressure; rhythm modulates from lyrical ("whistle of heat") to urgent ("heel to toe"). Minor register drift in "iron remembrance" slightly abstracts emotional texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mildew where last year waited" demonstrates high-density imagery. Near-flawless propulsion—only "bottled pasture" simile risks slight abstraction but pays off in final "thunder" motif without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms timekeeping tropes through sensory specificity ("receipts that tasted like rainstorms"). Risk-taking (non-numerical calendar) heightens stakes coherently; "cricket as New Year" feels inevitable yet fresh, meeting 9+ synthesis standard.</comment>
