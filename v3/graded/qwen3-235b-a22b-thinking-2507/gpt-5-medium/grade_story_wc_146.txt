<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "restore shared balance" triggers -0.5 diagnostic label penalty in peak beat. Micro-choices (mother's wary return) earn partial credit but insufficient for high-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost (abandoned years made palpable by uncurled thyme), but cost proof test fails—no exact sentence pinpoints new cost at ending beat beyond prior abandonment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Archway and tuning fork function as micro-setting, constraining pacing choices and charging final image ("at his heart"). Sparrow motif elevates tone but risks ornamental repetition; near-miss for 9.0 due to lyrical restraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency (footsteps pacing → cistern calibration), narrowing options to communal walking. Cost legible via abandoned kitchens reopening—conceptual price of years lost made visceral by thyme scent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unglamorous rhythm of return," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights revival as collective cadence, not decree—resonant answer to "shared balance" without stating moral. Near-flawless subtext in salvaged shutters vs. practiced steps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stones remembered," "silence sparkled") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "covenant of sound" slightly clashes with tuner's embodied action; otherwise exemplary Accumulative lens modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "narrow chalice" metaphor risks overwriting but pays off via dusk-drinking motif. Final beat’s "feet answering sparrow" achieves crystalline propulsion—only deduction: "wild hush" repetition borders on template cadence in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics and communal repair avoids trope pitfalls. "Rebuild covenant of sound with stone" transforms revival premise through specific stakes (warped bells → uncurled thyme), but lacks one bold risk to reach 8.8+.</comment>
