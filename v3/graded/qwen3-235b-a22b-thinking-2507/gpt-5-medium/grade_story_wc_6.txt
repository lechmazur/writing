<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically in micro-choices: sprinkling sand "like char that had learned to float" embodies her tension between fire and healing. Boy's bandaged hand forces visible tradeoff—teaching grafting instead of scolding—making endurance earn its cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "became the opposite of a fuse" crystallizes stance shift where the lagoon’s singing reweights "scars can sing" as actionable truth. Accumulative lens holds as density peaks with sand’s "healed edges" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains choices—kneeling to touch water, coin testing tides—and charges the final image where black sand "rested by the hose rack" as embodied ballast. Volcanic glass isn’t backdrop but pressure point enabling the sand’s floating.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake "can scars sing?" tightens when the lagoon’s "chorus of tiny breakages" answers her breath-spoken name, transforming abstract desire into sensory proof. Cost is visceral: she risks retraumatization ("matches rattling") to hear "healed edges" as non-burning truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sand’s metamorphosis—"char that had learned to float"—rejecting forgiveness for "direction." Final image of her as "opposite of a fuse" reweights "unyielding compassion" as active delay, not passive calm, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filters lava/salt through firefighter’s lexicon ("ballast," "drownings of flame"). Rhythm modulates from "clouds traveled like herens" cadence to staccato lagoon contact, with zero head-hopping despite boy’s arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "char that had learned to float" compresses history into active image. Minor figurative density in lagoon description ("fringed by mats of sea lettuce") justified by Accumulative lens, but "pale runes" slightly drifts from firefighter POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms arsonist/firefighter trope through volcanic specificity—black sand as ballast, obsidian lagoon as singing scar. Fresh inflection: grafting olive seedling with red thread redefines hope as "small vow" touching earth/water, avoiding redemption clichés.</comment>
