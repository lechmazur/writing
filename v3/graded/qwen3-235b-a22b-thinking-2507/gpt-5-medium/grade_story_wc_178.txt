<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mocked rites yet counted angles like a penitent"; the vow's cost ("attention dearer than silver") is embodied through plaster repair and oil rationing, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "pledged oil when oil was spare" forecloses personal gain. Accumulative lens holds via arithmetic density, though Saturn alignment slightly delays pressure escalation past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The magic square tile functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (water routing, bead press) and charging the final image where "wires sang." Plaster buckling and cistern water directly alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via "between regimes" pressure forcing the covenant vow, but Saturn's clearance feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "encrypted devotion" in arithmetic, culminating in resonant final image: "thrifty and keep its end of quiet" reweights devotion without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("dusk clung," "violet silk torn to ribbons") remains consistent under pressure; rhythmic control in "poured a palmful... rivulets track arithmetic's threads" avoids stress-induced syntax collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion but "dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat; no loops, though "patient hours/patient body" synonym nudge near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms astronomy tropes via "frugal covenant" concept; "thrifty" stewardship reweights devotion through specific Babylonian mechanics, avoiding abstract universality with bitumen-sealed urns and bronze pins.</comment>
