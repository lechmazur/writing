<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "willingly perplexed" vs maternal guilt; embodied emotion in "throat closed around that peculiar beauty" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to "unfasten every future knot" earns through naming specific failures, though newborn interaction stays abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: kneeling to mend future knots forecloses reclaiming lost time with visible cost ("throat closed again"). Accumulative lens holds as stalled seconds' release tightens the ritual's emotional pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: saucer crack constrains ritual (rotated to match lifeline), while lantern insects' "abdomen lamps" charge the final image. Frost-petaled grasses directly enable kneeling—environment shapes every choice without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) deepens through naming failures ("spoke water" for ungiven lullabies), narrowing options to atonement. Cost crystallizes in "I could not seize it, only atone," though mobile moons' chime slightly edges convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "time accumulates in unused halves of gestures" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image ("carry cloudbound repentance home like milk") delivers non-literal answer to where lost time resides—active tending, not retrieval.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: cartomancer's "choking beauty" lens filters all description. Rhythm modulates from clipped ("Some puzzles should stand upright like stones in wind") to flowing during ritual, avoiding stress-induced uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "time ran like milk down the clockface" replaces abstraction with idiosyncratic texture. Zero loops or scaffold; only microscopic strain in "minute frays" (time unit vs unraveling), but closure image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms motherhood tropes via cartomancer lens: "stalled seconds" chamber feels inevitable from "slurry of minutes." Specificity ("newborn's tiny starfish" hand) avoids generality, while risk-taking (lyric ritual) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
