<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices ("nosed kayak toward boy" despite feeling unfit), though "align heart and action" risks therapy-speak. Final endurance earns cost via mud galaxies and chest burn, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("sorrow carried like a chart"), lens firmly accumulative/textural. Minor tension in "align heart/action" slightly dilutes the earned final image’s weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains navigation ("skipping false cuts") and charges closure; compass reflection ties tool to psyche. Indispensable environment shapes every tactical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when boy’s request forces stance against "not fit" self-perception. Escalation driven by protagonist’s choice ("did not retreat"), though external catalyst slightly softens pure agency under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "drawing the same map" answers "steering one way while pulsing another" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "imperfect" closure and unbroken sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "gulls sang like somebody practicing forgiveness off-key"; syntax mirrors mental state ("planks easing from a dock"). Slight register drift in "backlash of regrets ruled my weather" prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero fatal loops, but "ghosts behind me, or ahead" has minor paraphrase redundancy. Figurative language remains precise in peak beats ("small galaxies of mud"), though "shoving the horizon slightly crooked" edges toward overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope via utility-pole navigation and "steadied, not fixed" resolution. Fresh inflection in mud galaxies and eelgrass agrounding, though emotional arc risks familiarity without maritime specificity.</comment>
