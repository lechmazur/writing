<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "coax those words to share their edges" versus shouting; embodied empathy via root-threading and stress-crack analysis avoids therapy-speak; minor deduction for underdeveloped flaw manifestation beyond "surrender cleverness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("surrender cleverness") under Accumulative/Textural lens; density shift from "symphony" to "pulse" reweights stakes; orientation solid but lens ambiguity precludes 9.0 despite flawless cost legibility in "pulse becomes a path."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: porcelain insulator constrains every choice (root-threading, strumming) and charges final image ("cooling dimming chime"); alder grove’s sensory details evolve causally with sap-memories and rain, avoiding static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via protagonist’s agency: "symphony" desire tightens to "pulse" realization with visible cost (surrendered cleverness); pressure coheres through escalating density shifts in "unsung phrases" to "breath into porcelain," perfectly scaled for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through action: "empathy in motion" becomes audible via strumming, not stated; final image ("quiet but no longer silent") reweights silence with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing while crystallizing the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("air keeps still as parchment"); rhythmic control mirrors pulse motif with cadence shifts at "I stop before stopping is heard"; minor deduction for "symphonically minded" register drift in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "fracture a faultline of memory" doing triple duty; final line’s "breath of hush" crystallizes closure; slight overwriting in "porcelain skin against old fractures" prevents 9.5 despite impeccable propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms nature-writing tropes via specific constraints (porcelain insulator’s brittleness, stress-crack analysis); risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes; emotional truth in "art is a vessel for bearing remembrances" avoids abstraction.</comment>
