<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("duty and curiosity pulled different ways") and embodied emotion via dust analysis create authentic tension. Final choice (winding spring backward) earns closure through prior causality, though "paid in breath enough" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: "the ticket office seemed lighter by the weight it lost" and dust's "new arrangement" crystallize reconfigured stakes. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as dust patterns drive the irreversible resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dust accumulation) constrains choices and charges closure—mouse paths guide beam discovery, while final dust settlement visually resolves the time debt. No ornamental detail; every sensory cue pressures the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via dust analysis narrows options from observation ("ripple the dust") to irreversible action ("wound it backward"), with cost legible in the office's physical lightness and the ghosts' release. Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "mainspring was a bank and a clock" reweights time as currency. Final dust arrangement offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust is how I read a room") and rhythmic control ("a whisper peeled itself free") persist under pressure. Elision (ghosts' indistinct voices) taught early and paid off in the weighted silence of release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "heavy with the memory of careful hands" is the sole borderline overwriting. Propulsion remains taut ("I slid a tile aside and found...") with closure image ("dust lift, swirl, and settle") achieving crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms elevator technician trope through specific logic: gravity's "diary" in dust patterns makes time debt tangible. Fresh synthesis of occupational detail and ghost lore feels inevitable, with risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
