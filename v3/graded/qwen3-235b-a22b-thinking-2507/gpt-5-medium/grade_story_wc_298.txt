<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("reckless idealist" tempered by "stubborn patience") drives micro-choices like offering name to the boy; closure choice (planting seeds) earns endurance with visible cost ("what you will never keep"). Secondary character lacks depth but sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("plant what you will never keep") under Accumulative lens; ash map rippling and bone-hand pit create decisive deepening. Orientation solid by line 3 ("beneath stone ribs").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains choice (bone-hand pit location) and charges closure via seeds; recurring tarot card reweights meaning from "teeth" to "tongue." Sensory details (bones "tasted of mercy") reflect urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: trading name enables the barter, narrowing options to one trade. Cost ("plant what you will never keep") visibly alters tactics (scattering stories as seeds), reweighting the dominant stake under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("inlaying meaning... to remind the dark it was seen"), not moralizing. Final image reweights idealism as "foolishness that learned to hold its breath," avoiding tidy resolution while charging prior material with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of candle soot," bones "chimed") modulates under pressure; rhythm shifts from lyrical ("lanterns pooled like thin honey") to staccato ("He laughed. Fiercely gentle...") without scaffold or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("cindery eyes" conveys grief/ash) with clean propulsion. Figurative language ("hush settled... like rain on coal") serves pressure without muddle, especially in closure beat where seeds "find the lost by noticing them."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "bartered destinies" via tactile mechanics (ivy contracts, ash maps); emotional truth in idealism tempered but not broken. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming tropes through specific cost ("growth must be borrowed").</comment>
