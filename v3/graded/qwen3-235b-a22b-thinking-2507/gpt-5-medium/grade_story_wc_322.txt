<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in architect's "rational enchantment" duality; embodied emotion peaks when curator's shoulder relaxes under thread's pressure. No diagnostic label-speak despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: "habits are artifacts worn on the inside" crystallizes the debt theme. Minor escalation dip at visitor's arrival prevents 9.0 despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sinew thread functions as micro-setting—constraining choices by gathering light/dust and charging final image. "Tiles brightened as footsteps retreated" exemplifies sensory selection reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) tightens through architect's thread-weaving, narrowing options to "temporary allegiance." Cost legible in curator's physical release but secondary debt theme lacks full integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through thread-as-habit metaphor; final image reweights "bridge that appears only when crossed" without moralizing. "Weak gravity between strangers" avoids thematic echo via concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: architect notices "weather" in illusions, curator "leans toward promise." Rhythmic control peaks in "laughter softened to breath" with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops but "bark after rain" metaphor repeats unnecessarily in thread descriptions. Sentence propulsion falters slightly in ladders scene with "clinked like arguments" overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "fever dream architect" transforms trope via sinew thread's physicality. Risk-taking heightens stakes—"rational enchantment" avoids abstraction through calibrated gravity.</comment>
