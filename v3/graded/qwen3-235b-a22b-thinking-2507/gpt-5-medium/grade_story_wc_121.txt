<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear/need of labyrinth) is embodied in the room refusal and lowering action, but motivation remains abstract ("conquer labyrinth of self") without concrete stakes. Micro-choices like breath control during timeline navigation reveal values, yet emotional progression lacks visceral specificity at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when toes kiss stone and timelines stabilize, with cost legible in "surrender gravity" and shadow's return. Lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (Accumulative vs. Hybrid) preventing 9.0, though pressure coheres through procedural pattern tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Viaduct functions as micro-setting: slick surface constrains movement ("toes refusing the slick"), while puddles charge the final image by releasing "choreographies back to chance." Misses 9.0 as environment doesn't shape earlier tactics beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("conquer labyrinth") signals late (line 5), weakening escalation. Tightening occurs at middle arch when runes align, forcing the lowering choice with visible cost ("surrender gravity"), but the pressure build lacks one earlier causal beat to justify 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "labyrinth sits flat on ground" reframes conquest as surrender, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("patience to begin where avoided ending") resonates non-literally, though "darkening brightness" motif slightly over-signals the thematic shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("puddles were altars reflecting low, darkening brightness") and rhythmic control peak in "hovering no grander than breath finding a snag." Patterned elision (fractured timelines) is taught early and paid off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, with propulsion in "water chased the grooves." Minor artifact: "learned to think like that" is explanatory telling in high-pressure beat, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline density and the "cooled wires" sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "eternal recurrence" through tactile details (clay tablet, rainlight script) and the radical redefinition of conquest as surrender. Risk-taking heightens stakes, but "labyrinth of self" phrasing leans toward familiar abstraction, limiting 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
