<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through visible struggle. "Offered what I had" reveals values but no internal tension during the pivotal seed-cupping moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("plinth sighed" under the seed's weight), but escalation lacks meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. The single pressure point (quantifying absence) doesn't sufficiently narrow options or alter tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (bottled moonlight) charges the final image by transforming the counter map into a seed-cradle. Glass apple and plinth constrain choices through their opacity and untoldness, though the cloud sea remains atmospheric backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story seeds) is coherent but pressure never viscerally tightens; "quantifying absence" feels ritualistic rather than urgent. Cost remains conceptual ("heavy with maybe") without altering the vendor's physical or emotional state in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the comma-seed reweights "blanks shaped like forgiveness" into earned potential. Final image ("felt its meaning test my palm") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in the delicate "heavy with maybe" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "floorboards creak like timid prologues" and "lull stretched, a narrow bridge of hour." Minor abstraction dilutes pressure ("art of silence"), but rhythm modulates effectively with the moonlight ritual's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("mindfully scattered... practiced the art of silence and then taken a vow") dull immediacy. Final image ("bird judging weather beyond the nest") achieves crystalline clarity despite earlier abstract stretches like "weighed the hesitations."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "clean slate vendor" with library/orchard creates emotional specificity. The comma-seed transforms abstract "beginnings" into tangible weight, avoiding magical realism clichés through the vendor's tactile engagement with the plinth's sigh.</comment>
