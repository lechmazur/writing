<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied contradiction (shouted for causes vs. teaching through listening) and micro-choices (erasing judgments) feel authentic; students’ symbolic weight slightly outweighs individual depth despite distinct vocal textures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rafi passing the rosette to Ola reconfigures hatred into trust with visceral cost (the room "unclenching"), under Accumulative/Textural lens; minor vagueness in "across unlearning hatred" timeframe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Velvet library actively pressures choices (shelves "breathing," curtains as "throats"); the rosette as micro-setting constrains the climax (Rafi catching it) and charges the final image ("carrying traveled stillness home").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s subtraction method narrowing options (erasing judgments → denoting rests); cost is emotional vulnerability crystallized when Rafi catches the rosette, though "across unlearning hatred" lacks precise temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rosette’s journey ("vanishing arts do not disappear when held together"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "traveled stillness" as carried resilience without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soft arithmetic that converts strangers into neighbors") with rhythmic control; "suspicions tapping in twos" slightly abstracts tension but earns payoff in unified rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fist opens when it realizes it is only holding air") with clear propulsion; rosette repetition earns resonance through reweighted closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms choir trope via "subtracting noise" method; emotional specificity in "expectantly resigned" students avoids templates; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
