<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in exile's origin (mercy vs insolence) and the girl's silent communication; micro-choices like correlating silences reveal hierarchy of values. Slight vagueness in girl's motivation prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when the stone placement reveals the covenant's "shadowed side" with conceptual cost: "they had never promised erasure of desire." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basalt worry stone constrains every choice—fitting the hollow charges the final image. Sensory details like "iron dust" on river stones reflect urgency without cataloging. Environment-as-tool elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("how difficult beauty survives") tightens via the moonrise deadline and hum correlation, forcing the endgame choice. Visible cost: exile's origin and the covenant's true terms. Escalation through textural pressure meets 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-as-silence without moralizing; the hollow stone's transformation reweights "stillness" into "desire not erased." Final line’s "hopeful melancholy" offers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is chess-tutor specific ("bishop on color," "knight path"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—long sentences during resonance, clipped phrases for taps. Zero voice contamination in silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "past scattered like filings" shows density without muddle. Final line’s "hopeful melancholy I could hold" crystallizes theme with propulsion. Figurative language sparse and precise in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: magnetic fields as emotional resonance, chess as subtextual language. Tropes transformed via specific stakes—exile for teaching stalemate as mercy. Risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
