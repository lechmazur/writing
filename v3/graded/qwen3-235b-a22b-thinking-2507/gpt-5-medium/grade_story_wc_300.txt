<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("training said isolate... pulse said listen") and embodied emotion ("palace brightened but did not shine outward") feel authentic; micro-choice placing the pearl reveals hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "dissolve walls between hearts" risks thematic echo but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "pearl dimmed as its radiance migrated outward" proves felt sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—"resonant hush" deepens into "pressure change like tears" without causal breaks. "Heartbeat of hesitation" timing slightly abstract but paid off by crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: quartz spire constrains the pivotal action ("crowned the quartz spire"), light-bending enables the pearl's radiance migration. "Frozen rain" and "ghost rivers" reflect urgency without static description. Misses 9+ by narrow margin—spire's texture doesn't actively alter tactics beyond being placement point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: confessions deepen isolation/communion conflict, forcing the crown choice with visible cost (pearl's dimming = personal sacrifice). "Breath shallow so sobs would not waste air" tightens oxygen scarcity into moral calculus. Unmistakable cost in "radiance migrated outward, not spent, but invested."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "cultivated pearl" and "lullabies in canned peaches" reweight "latent radiance" into earned wisdom. Final image ("door made of faces... shared unspent light") answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character articulates the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "cave crown me with stillness," "confessions... filament of latent radiance" filter world through inspector's emotional lexicon. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses during hesitation). One elevated phrase ("warm with small responsibility") slightly jars but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light did not burst; it inhaled" demonstrates masterful rhythm control. Every line charges momentum—"unseen doors inside the world clicked open" does triple duty. Minor abstraction in "warm with small responsibility" costs 0.3 but closure image ("faces... mending") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms bunker trope via specific alchemy: "pearl grown from a tear" synthesizes grief and hope into fresh emotional logic. "Confessions etched in shell spiral" avoids derivative safety—mechanics (voice→hallway) feel inevitable. Bold risk in lyric escalation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
