<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the sister's absence: "missing parts of my sister, the way her laugh began in her shoulder" embodies loss through embodied specificity. Final choice to seal memory into the tin earns closure through prior causality—wildflowers' scent return proves cost. No stock phrasing; flaw (inability to hold memory) compounds action organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the scent of hillside returns like a forgiven word" crystallizes the path through change with visible emotional cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via salt/memory motifs, and the final image ("hands full") reweights the whale's gravity with conceptual cost. Lens named by midpoint ("chambers of salt have been listening").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers (micro-setting) charge the final image: scent return directly constrains the closure action. Salt chamber isn't backdrop but functional constraint—crystals archive "anything too soft to keep itself," enabling memory recovery. Sensory details (salt-paper tin, frozen glass panes) filter through lantern-lighter's tactile priorities, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: "find where deleted memories go" shifts from abstract yearning to physical excavation under gravity pockets' pressure. The exhume action (9E) forecloses passive searching, altering tactics with visible cost (disrupted sand, fluttering gravity). Escalation via pattern break—coffee grounds' spiral becomes tangible corridor—reweights the memory stake with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from salt-memory synthesis: "crystals archive the shoreline" becomes the story's core without statement. Final image ("path through change... walk home with hands full") offers non-literal answer to "where deleted memories go," reweighting the whale's gravity as connective tissue. Avoids sentimentality—cost is earned through the tin's transformed scent, not declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: lantern-lighter notices "ropes slacken as if pockets of gravity bump" through occupational lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("ground lifts my heel, then eats my step") mirrors fluctuating gravity. No head-hopping; elision (sister's backstory) taught early via wildflowers and paid off in closure. Voice modulates from observational to urgent during excavation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density without muddle: "lantern light gathers like birds on a winter wire" compresses setting, emotion, and motif. Final line’s cadence ("hands full") resolves opening’s "gleaming silence" with precise propulsion. No figurative overwriting—even "whispering pattern of trapped air" serves plot. Coffee grounds description avoids sensory checklist by tying to gravity search.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in memory-as-physical-archive: deleted memories aren't abstract but "sit in rows like library books," transforming trope through salt-crystal specificity. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—whale's "gravity seed" redefines loss as navigable terrain. Avoids safety middle; emotional truth anchors universals in "pressed wildflowers pulse with color" during sister's laugh.</comment>
