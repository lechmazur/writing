<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation to translate heartbeats into maps, embodied through physical patience and micro-choices like conserving starlight. Strengths: concrete actions revealing values (saving ampoule for return). Weakness: limited demonstration of contradictory impulses during pivotal moments; sister memory informs but doesn't create active internal conflict during the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the lake's exhalation and aurora's movement reconfigure the frozen world with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible in "bones crackling" and conserved starlight. Orientation is solid by paragraph one; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density accumulation to the fissure-sealing climax. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The withered orchard actively constrains choices—frozen sap demands patience, bottle-glass becomes path markers, and the "closed eye" bark directly enables the climax. Micro-setting (ampoule, plate) charges the final image where "orchard's hearts beat into lines." Environment isn't backdrop but tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (creating a path through silence) tightens through the alchemist's deepening engagement: starlight activation narrows options to sealing the fissure. Agency is clear in every ritual step. Cost is physical (frost-traced lashes, crackling bones) and conceptual (conserving starlight), though the final cost lacks visceral immediacy in the last beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "translating heartbeats into maps" becomes literal when pulse braids with starlight. Final image ("orchard's hearts beat into lines") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Avoids all anti-patterns—no thematic echo, with ambiguity in "blank space no printer had dared fill" lingering post-closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: alchemy terms filtered through tactile observation ("frost traced his eyelashes," "hush-boom of heartbeats"). Rhythm modulates perfectly from frozen stillness to exhalation. One minor slip: "demonstrating patience physically" slightly drifts into academic register during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "bottle-glass, each nudged to echo the rising" multiplies meaning without scaffold. Zero loops; metaphors serve pressure ("branches like ribs"). Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting. One hairline issue: "demonstrating patience physically" risks template cadence but isolated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "mapmaker" trope through specific alchemy mechanics (vanishing flash-paper paths, starlight ampoule as constrained resource). Emotional truth in sister memory avoids sentimentality. Freshness in "safekept starlight" as tactical limitation—though "closed eye" bark slightly echoes common symbolism, redeemed by concrete use in climax.</comment>
