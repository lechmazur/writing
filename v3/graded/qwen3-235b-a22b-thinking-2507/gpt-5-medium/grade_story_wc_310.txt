<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "reluctant bones" versus Sori's courage, but final choice lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during climax; micro-choices like coin flipping earn endurance yet fall short of Q1 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost—"old shame fall away like a husk"—under flawless Accumulative/Textural lens; persistent constraint of backward causality shapes every tactic toward the hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber observatory deck transforms from static setting to active lens ("dilated, swallowing the amber"), while coins constrain choices and charge the final image; micro-setting meets 9+ gate through causal pressure on gyros.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening understanding ("prophecy braided us") narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost legible in shed "old shame" and "breathing to metronome," though single tightening lacks secondary stake complexity for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "crack the amber of intention," with final line reweighting static as "prayer" without moralizing; avoids binaries by embracing uncertainty's necessity as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("coins ring like compact planets") and rhythmic control under pressure; syntactic compression during "snow clump into words" teaches pattern early and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "static softened, as if dead stars pleased" achieves high density without figurative muddle; final line's crystalline propulsion exemplifies line-level mastery in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backwards prophecy as "recipe in reverse" transforms tropes through specific mechanics; risk-taking in causal inversion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
