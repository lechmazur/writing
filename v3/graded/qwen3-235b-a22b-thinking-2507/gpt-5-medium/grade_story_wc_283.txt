<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("locked script" vs "key that turns both ways") drives theft and button cataloging with embodied cost in the confessed theft and changed oath; micro-choices like easing the jar's pitch seam reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: villagers receiving pages crystallizes stance with visible cost (theft confessed, prophecy "soften[ed] into clay"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through button-echo matching, reweighting the dominant stake of sealed vs shared wisdom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The cataloged buttons function as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's choice (material matching) and charging the final image where "tiniest buttons shine like planets," transforming them from evidence to "invitations" that reconfigure the warehouse's purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens: the dominant stake (trapped prophecy vs living possibility) tightens via the button-echo matching process, narrowing options to a single deepening choice with felt cost in the theft's confession and shifted oath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (buttons as "decisions that slipped"), avoiding moralizing; the final image of buttons as "vowels laid beside consonants" offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of fixed fate vs shared story.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glass sweats with the breath of distance," "sand lingers at the narrows like a held breath") shows rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful compression ("the method came to me the way a moth comes") is taught early and pays off in the ledger's transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("Tin for the bright taut syllables, bone for the older vowels") with clear propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent phrases but never dulls closure ("prophecy soften into clay, quick between the fingers").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of timekeeping and button cataloging feels inevitable; risk-taking (prophecy as loom, not line) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming the "amber warehouse" from prison to open conduit with emotional specificity.</comment>
