<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "reluctant caretaker" duty versus seasonal escape promises, embodied in root-tightening physicality. Boy's nut question reveals hierarchy of values with micro-choice to teach "right shapes," earning endurance without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "orchard loosened its hold, just a little" crystallizes cost of obeying its bargain while "cliffs hold their breath" reweights the entrapment cycle. Accumulative lens holds through lichen map → nut-planting sequence with visceral time pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth actively constrains choices via shifting geometry and frost deadline, while the nut charges the final image ("mouthed a promise to plant it safely"). Sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows to salt, clicking birds, and wooden-boned apples under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten coherently under Accumulative lens: shadow reaching split trunk → early frost announcement forces hurried lichen-map passage. Cost legible in caretaker's continued entrapment ("afterward, the orchard will find me") despite temporary reprieve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through blueprint motif's evolution from "city planned on paper" to lichen map → nut-locked wall, rejecting tidy morals. Final cliff image ("graceless and beautiful") reweights the central question of duty without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brass feathers scraping the wind" and "apples study gravity," with rhythmic control during high-pressure beats ("heel to hollow, breath for breath"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly for Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clockwork wings shearing the path into glittering chaff" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s cadence shift ("Thus the hours coil...") recharges motifs without figurative muddle, fulfilling 9+ textural control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms cursed-orchard trope through specific logic: trees "whisper to rocks about broken promises," guidance as duty from eating fruit. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes while nut-planting payoff feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
