<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (e.g., "I want to unveil ordinary miracles" vs. repairing cracks); embodied emotion avoids labels ("trembling calm in my hands"). Flaw: Partner's labor backstory lacks visible cost until late, slightly weakening early motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "We are three" reweights time as shared vulnerability. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure tightens through droplet cadence shifts. Minor friction: Rey's arrival slightly dilutes the core dyad's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The clepsydra constrains choices (screw fit determines repair viability) and charges the final image ("cradling time as you might cradle a head newly crowned"). Fog/thinned ribbons mirror emotional shifts without cliché. Micro-setting mastery elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via protagonist’s agency: "humanize the instrument" shifts from metaphor to tactile action. Cost is felt in the tremor "carry[ing] through metal, water, and then into his knuckles." Escalation lacks one visible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a tool) to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "reading between lines" as action (tracing breath on glass), not statement. Final image ("water and laughter") reweights time as embodied connection, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo—earned through screw’s birth symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "water clocks murmur like cautious throats" filters world through repairer’s ears. Voice modulates under stress (shortened syntax during repair). No head-hopping; fog-swallowed sound teaches pattern early for legible closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "braille of droplets" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor register drift: "emotional terrain" leans academic but saved by "sailors listen to waves." Final-third artifact ("conceptual cost") avoids Q7 cap but prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: water clocks as emotional conduits feel fresh through midwife screw specificity. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Lacks one bold inflection (e.g., deeper occupational detail) to breach 8.8.</comment>
