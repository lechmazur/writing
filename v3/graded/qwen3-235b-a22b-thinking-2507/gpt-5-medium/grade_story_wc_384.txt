<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truths in lies, lies in seals) drive every micro-choice; the renunciation of completion for forgiveness earns visible cost through embodied stakes ("unlinked from power"). The thorn's memory of betrayed oaths crystallizes internal conflict without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "I leave a margin blank where a verdict might have gone" reconfigures mercy with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through dripping stalactites as hesitations, with cost proven in "the only honest room" foreclosing finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary constrains every choice: marble becomes pages, drips tempo strokes, aurora folds veils. The bone key humming with light directly enables the "silence waiting" lock mechanism, charging the closure image where time itself becomes "the small space grief needed."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (completing vs. forgiving the unfinished) tightens through accumulation: "breathless commas" and "faint chorus of pauses" narrow options until the blank margin choice. Cost is legible in "linked to patience" after exile, driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "unlink the line before it tightens" becomes the blank margin, reweighting mercy as active patience. Final image ("thorn loosens into roots") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding false balance—the city's betrayal remains wrong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "aurora streams across the ceiling... pearl twilight turning marble to pages" filters setting through calligrapher's eye. Rhythmic control peaks in "confession that bows like a reed and blessing that rises like breath," compressing pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; each line multiplies meaning ("heritage rose thorn" embodies betrayed oaths). Figurative language serves pressure: "mercy offered too quickly becomes another whip" avoids muddle. Final line recharges opening with "stalactites drip and letters breathe," achieving crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms calligraphy tropes through "calibrated treason" as moral calculus. The blank margin insight synthesizes craft and philosophy organically—no safety middle. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes: mercy requires unfinished space, made specific through ink, thorn, and bone key.</comment>
