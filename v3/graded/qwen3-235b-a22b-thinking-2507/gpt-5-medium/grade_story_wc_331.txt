<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between scientific logic and poetic longing remains abstract; "warmer mathematics" desire lacks embodied micro-choice during climax despite strong scarf symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when scarf wrings salt into snow on patrons; cost is visible in their unknowing transformation while library's "counting back in waves" crystallizes the stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library setting provides rich texture but rarely constrains action; saddle space enables transition yet seabed shelves emerge without prior environmental pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find where stories live") tightens through scarf's transformation, but escalation feels passive—librarian's quiet methods avoid showing the cost of rejecting mentor's "shock" approach during pivotal shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "coastlines" motif reweighted at closure; "stories live where vectors curve around a heart" avoids moralizing while "seen its weather" delivers earned conceptual repricing without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "shoes whispering proofs" and "letters tilt into new alignments"; rhythmic control falters slightly in "unmap and my staff" where diction drifts from librarian's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with "napkin mapped coastline" image; minor scaffold in "logic of breath" description slightly dilutes momentum without harming closure's crystalline "snow falls into letters" beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic shelving transforms library trope through specific mathematical longing; "seabed shelves heavy with wet paper" provides fresh inflection that grows organically from prior curvature motifs without gimmickry.</comment>
