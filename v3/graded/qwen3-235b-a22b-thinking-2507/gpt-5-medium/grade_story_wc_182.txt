<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("coughing vowels," "conjugations like ladders") but motivation lacks contradictory impulses; the "simple and impossible" quest feels undisturbed by internal conflict, weakening the 9+ gate. Micro-choices like declining syllables for leaves reveal values, yet flaws don’t compound meaningfully before closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library’s opening with "seeds into the aisles" reconfigures stakes through conceptual cost (neglected questions sprouting), but the Accumulative/Textural lens weakens escalation—pressure accumulates through lyrical density rather than narrowing options, missing Q4’s escalation band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The botanical diary (micro-setting) constrains choice ("warmed the page," "script exhaled") and charges the final image (leaves unpressing into seeds), satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory details like "air tastes similar" and "peppermint bark" filter through the linguist’s bias, making the bookstore a tactile, lived-in crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("rescue missions") are signaled early but remain abstract; the cost is conceptual (neglected questions) rather than viscerally felt on-page. Escalation lacks a tightening choice that narrows options—pressure grows through lyrical accumulation, not protagonist agency, failing the 8.8+ band requirement for visible price charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the sprouting seeds ("petals bright with might-have-beens"), reweighting "unlearned lessons" as generative rather than punitive. Avoids moralizing; the final image offers resonant ambiguity about error and gentler futures without stating a thesis, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("consonants that hum," "catalog holes"), with rhythmic control deepening under pressure ("shelves relocating like chairs in an orchestra"). Elision (e.g., time traveler’s vanishings) is taught early and paid off in closure, avoiding head-hopping despite multi-shard structure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("spines grew blank, as if waiting to be taught") propels momentum. One mixed metaphor ("air tastes similar") slightly muddles in a high-pressure beat, preventing 9.0, but no artifacts dull closure—the sprouting seeds image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "library" trope through linguistic stakes ("rescuing gentler futures from the overlooked"), with specificity like "phonemes resembling footfalls." Risk-taking (Accumulative lens, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence without gimmickry, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s fresh synthesis.</comment>
