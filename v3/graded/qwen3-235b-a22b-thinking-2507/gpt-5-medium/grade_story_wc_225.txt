<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: chess tutor’s strategic precision ("knight’s pace, L-shaped") wars with embodied remorse ("tasted ashes from the kingdom I had burned"). Final choice to restore time incrementally—rejecting "brilliant sacrifice"—earns renunciation with visible cost in the mason’s dust fall and barmaid’s softened joke.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: "woven hush" density escalates to "breathing hush" via thread-pulling choices. Closure is Charged Poise—village reanimation and self-forgiveness crystallized by the platinum labyrinth’s overflow, with cost legible in "tasted ashes" during wrong pulls. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains choices (tracing droplet journeys) and charges closure ("overflowed"). Tapestry border’s frayed threads evolve from static detail to active pressure point. Micro-setting (fountain, threads) directly enables climax, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness via time restoration) tightens through protagonist’s agency: counting thread-pulls tests commitment. Cost escalates palpably—"village inhale" vs. "tasted ashes"—peaking at the center’s binary choice. Storm’s "held drumbeat" sustains pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess/village metaphor: "sacrificing villages" reweights into incremental restoration. Final image (overflowing labyrinth, "began to forgive") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. "Some flights must wait for weather" reframes ambition through cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chess-trained eye ("read patterns of ambition") filters setting ("L-shaped" counting, "tokens" for misfortune). Rhythmic control under pressure ("breathed until fierce repose settled") avoids syntactic monotony. No head-hopping; tense/stage remain stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in tapestry description ("barmaid, a mason, a child") slightly slows momentum. Otherwise high density: "water daring to slip a step" does triple duty. Zero loops; metaphors cohere ("woven hush" to "breathing hush"). Final line’s "began to forgive" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess tutor applying strategy to undo time-frozen regret transforms "sacrifice" trope. Tapestry-border mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"fierce repose" modulates to earned quiet.</comment>
