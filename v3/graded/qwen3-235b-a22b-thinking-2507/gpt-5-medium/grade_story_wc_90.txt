<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "let my fists unclench" amid anger naming; final promise to "only unseal what could be tended" earns change through prior causality. Slight abstraction in "ghostly resolve" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed chamber reweights "unlocking futures" into "tending beginnings" with visible cost in "caught a rail before I floated off." Accumulative lens holds perfectly through tear-maps and emotional calibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (cooling pulse during anger) and charges closure ("forgiving weight"). Ship's recycled nature pressures tactics via album navigation, though comet anchor lacks full constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake (emotional balance for door) tightens through deepening: "Compassion without its shadow is brittle" crystallizes options. Cost legible in physical struggle against floating, though lock mechanics could heighten pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard/seed particulars, not moralizing. Final image of "tending sprouts" reweights "beginning again" without stating a moral. Avoids thematic echo despite "shadow work" label via concrete execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: grief as "silver salt," joy as "workable buoyancy." Rhythmic control under pressure ("thread to shadow and shadow to thread") with no head-hopping. Slight syntactic monotony in greenhouse reflection prevents 9.4.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("tears long dried into silver salt" serves navigation). Figurative language stays purposeful in peak beats. Minor cadence stiffness in "stitch myself" passage prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravitational emotion physics with pacifism. Tear's dual role (cooling pulse/balance tool) transforms mystical tropes. "Stitching a promise with breath" reconfigures closure with risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
