<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("waiting was also a choice") and embodied micro-choices (vine touch borrowing breath) earned the climax. No therapy-speak despite high stakes; flaws like shrapnel accident informed her resolve without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: council's arrival to "argue" against the already-rooted scaffold crystallizes cost—tradition's evolution is irreversible. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; density peaks when "groundmind gathered her declared map," reweighting destiny with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hot springs function as micro-setting: vault beneath "hottest pool" and "mirror of fire water" unsealing constrain choice. Steam cradling "bubbles like secrets" mirrors Lida’s tension, but ash-years backstory slightly dilutes immediacy per BRR.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when council refusal forces Lida’s solo vault descent—visible cost is oath violation. Escalation driven by her agency ("waiting was also a choice"), not coincidence; "implanted destiny" reweights options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "iron nails in seed" evolving to "destiny a tool," avoiding moralizing. Final image—"seedling kept listening, learning us"—resonantly answers "implanted destiny" without stating morals, charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "mince of syllables slide through cattail" filters world through plant telepathy. Voice modulates under stress (kite decoding’s "sun faded and rain stiff" to "braid of futures"), but "implanted destiny" phrasing slightly drifts academic in council scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "porous rock by her knee" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" near climax risks POV lexicon, but "honey-softened amber" and "learning stairs" sustain propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "rebel elder" trope via specific mechanics: kite codes from "clandestine days," vine’s "borrowed breath." Emotional truth in "hunger for chosen intent" avoids generic activism; reconstruction timeframe heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
