<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("boldly sympathetic, a flaw and a craft") manifest in tangible micro-choices: reed sculptures marking whispers, leaning posture adoption. Final endurance ("not healed, not finished, but grafted") earns cost through prior causality—Farrin's chalk question initiating the search.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the ache in me stayed, but now it glowed like a lantern meant for many hands." Accumulative lens holds—the search's density ("gossip, chalk ghosts, rumor-weather") tightens into the seam discovery, reweighting "Together" as posture over image with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard actively constrains choices: roots pool stardust guiding whispers, panes reflect faces to recruit participants, fused leaves reveal the tag. Final image ("panes went dusk-blue") charges the setting, with obsidian shards as "teeth" altering the arbor's construction tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Accumulative pressure: failed searches (baker's swallow, diver's coil) deepen the dominant stake (community reconnection) until the seam discovery forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—"not healed, not finished"—with the posture adoption foreclosing easy resolution through embodied endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the leaning posture: "a ring of bodies shaped a living arbor where voices pooled and cooled." Avoids moralizing; the final image reweights loss ("luminescent ache") as communal light without abstraction, answering "how to rebuild?" through embodied repetition ("return to that curve").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "void-sun bending light into humming nets," "mineral sigh" of crater. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("We practiced it there, leaning like that curve... pivot points touching at the ribs"), with patterned elision (lost languages, ash storm) taught early and paid off in closure’s breath/posture language.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; high density ("stardust sugar," "humming nets of light") propels momentum. One minor figurative softness ("wind could carry it as dust") in non-closure beat prevents 9.7+, but no muddle in peak beats—closure’s "glowed like a lantern meant for many hands" crystallizes cost with visceral clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms community-rebuilding trope through crystalline grammar and posture-as-tag. Fresh inflection: "tag was not a picture but a posture," growing from prior details (chalk questions, rib-touching). Emotional specificity ("luminescent ache") avoids generic templates, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
