<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "blade disguised as salve" veers into diagnostic label-speak during peak crisis, undermining embodied contradiction. Micro-choices like cracking the hourglass earn closure, yet "hate the truth of how often I am right" lacks specific physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: breaking the hourglass embodies the "felt cost" test via cold sand in fossilized ring. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through sensory accumulation ("shivers of yesterday" to "fossilized morning") without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Frosted hourglass and coffee rings function as micro-setting, constraining choice when sand is poured into the fossilized ring. Final image ("closure is not a gate but a garden") charges the recurring objects with irreversible specificity, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. closure) tightens through coffee-ring analysis deepening into fossil interpretation, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible ("tasting loam and apology"), yet pressure feels observational rather than actively shaped by choices until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "coffee rings hardened into fossilized morning" reweights "truth of how often I am right" into earned wisdom. Avoids moralizing, but "blade disguised as salve" slightly overstates the thematic conflict in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("pins of sensation return, each pin a star") persists under stress with rhythmic control. Ivy’s telepathy avoids head-hopping through consistent embodied framing, though "meteor hush" repetition risks template cadence without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "frosted hourglass" repetition evolves meaningfully. Near-miss on overwriting: "meteor hush" appears three times but gains necessity through closure linkage. Final line’s "garden I will learn" avoids sentimentality via tactile verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through plant telepathy and coffee-ring forensics, with "displaced miracle" feeling inevitable. Risks poetic density but avoids gimmickry; specificity of "soil scars and spilled coffee" grounds universals. Lacks one fresh inflection beyond established lyric mode.</comment>
