<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong in arsonist identity ("preserve memory, not erase"), but "analytically intuitive" label dominates over embodied conflict during key discoveries. Volcanic tenderness shows well in seed-planting beat, yet moral ambiguity lacks grit in final renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: seeds writing names onto wind crystallizes memory-as-breath with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clear by line 3 ("archive slept beneath dunes"), but "analytically intuitive" repetition risks scaffold loop near climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-settings constrain choices: mosaic river guides movement, oculus enables seed scene. Clay jar and thread alter tactics meaningfully. Final dunes "speaking" slightly detaches from concrete setting work earlier, missing full 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: aligning tapestry to canvas, stitching portrait throat. Escalation via Accumulative density—each artistic clue deepens the memory-rescue cost. "Soot lifted... revealing letters burned" makes conceptual price viscerally legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "ledger of gratitude" shown via seed-writing, not stated. Final image reweights "ruin" into "vow kept" without moralizing. Volcanic tenderness transforms from label to embodied "lending of breath" with no Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("painting birds pointed beaks," "murals shivered with salt") modulates beautifully under pressure. But "analytically intuitive" recurs like template phrasing, diluting voice coherence during critical discoveries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats; "sunlight knifed through" propels momentum. Minor density issue in opening ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness" slightly overwrought), but final line’s rhythmic control elevates without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "library" trope via concrete specifics (punctuation seeds, bronze feathers). "Lending of breath" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking heightens stakes—arson as "primer" for new writing—without obscuring clarity.</comment>
