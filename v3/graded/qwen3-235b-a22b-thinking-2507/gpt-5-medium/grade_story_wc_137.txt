<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrator's "sympathetic skeptic" motivation drives micro-choices under pressure (e.g., offering tea after denying ghosts), but Lio's grief lacks contradictory impulses. Final endurance—"skeptic with mercy"—earned though internal conflict feels slightly summarized during the chair scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the cleared table with "two chairs set like steady stars" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost (grief exchanged without resolution). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pattern density intensifies through whale breaches and cooling sums, reweighting "entangled memories" as friction-warmed passageways.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tower functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (aligning tile to "whale road," parapet placement) and charges the final image. Whale migration timeframe pressures Lio's urgency ("last season"), while the salt-chimed tower actively evolves with the cold front—environment never static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (can patterns create connection without mysticism?) tightens via whale breaches aligning with tile columns. Cost is legible in the narrator’s surrender of pure skepticism ("I believed her then") while maintaining integrity—a visible tradeoff in the chair scene’s "griefs exchanged coats."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "entangled memories" reframed as currents coupling shores, not mysticism. Final image of chairs reweights the central question without moralizing—griefs "exchanged coats" to see how they fit, avoiding tidy resolution while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone rib cage facing constellations," "gulls like torn letters") deepens under pressure. Rhythm modulates flawlessly—from lyrical opening to staccato whale breach ("a pod breached in unison")—with no head-hopping. Patterned elision (Ana’s notes) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("the sums closed softly, a door that had waited years"). Figurative language ("ink looked like her ship's wake") charges peak beats without muddle. Final line’s "tending the unheard symphony" resolves with textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope via specific mechanics: tile as "discipline," not magic. Whale migration setting integral to tile alignment. Emotional truth avoids sentimentality—connection earned through transcription labor, not whimsy. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
