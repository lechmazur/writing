<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "chastity as chosen emptiness" powers micro-choices like untangling threads under patrol pressure; embodied cost visible in "panic snags thread" but "bodily poetic" repetition risks mannerism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "city inhaled differently" reconfigures conformity with conceptual cost (guards' pikes sighing into frost); Accumulative lens holds through echo-harvest escalation, though transition to tunnels slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Snow functions as micro-setting constraint: "thread no thicker than snowlight" and "bowl of snow" charge final image; prism's light-bending directly enables the counterchant, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as patrol arrives; "window between sigh and smile" shrinks while she works, but the single escalation lacks a visible loss that alters tactics beyond panic management.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image "learning slowly how to refuse and still sing" reweights conformity theme without moralizing; "harvest of echoes" becomes embodied resistance rather than abstract concept through the loom rethreading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "threads spun from vows whispered then forgotten" filtering all details; rhythmic control intensifies under patrol pressure ("feet press snow into coins") without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but "bodily poetic" appears 4x creating mild scaffold; "alarming serenity" density risks muddling urgency during patrol beat though final image remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan-as-activist using acoustic resistance; "prism sanctuary" transforms trope into tangible tool with irreversible stakes shift, avoiding derivative archetypes.</comment>
