<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "bruised awe" and "beautifully flawed" motif, but single-POV constraint limits relationship dynamics; micro-choices like filing the brass tooth reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("salt-crusted, careful, and tired") as singing alters global stakes; Accumulative lens holds perfectly through patterned escalation to the lullaby's ripple effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hush pane and nested gears function as micro-setting that charges the final image; "oil on gloves" and "bent brass tooth" constrain choices while embodying thematic weight without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure ("needle leans further") with visceral cost in the filing scene, but political "thunder" feels slightly abstract against intimate machinery focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "stitch in a torn flag" and lullaby's forgiveness without moralizing; final image reweights "beautifully flawed" as earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath of oil on gloves," "driftwood saints") with rhythmic control; voice modulates perfectly from hushed precision to singing climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "throat filling before impossible song" risks mixed metaphor but pays off through pattern-teaching; final image's "stitch in torn flag" achieves crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday trope through "lullaby across lifetimes" and pane of hush; emotional specificity in "minister forgot sermon/held stranger's hand" avoids generic salvation narratives.</comment>
