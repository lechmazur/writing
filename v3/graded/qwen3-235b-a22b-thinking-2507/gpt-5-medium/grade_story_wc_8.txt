<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices like writing "Listen" despite rejecting "mercy's mask," but micro-choices lack physical struggle under pressure (e.g., no trembling hands during locker opening).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: copying names under gilded L crystallizes the historian's stance with conceptual cost ("truth without contempt"), though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) slightly weakens escalation clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ivy and ledger constrain choices (e.g., rain of seeds during discovery), while the charred slips charge the final image; rose petals frame time with visceral consequence, exceeding micro-setting expectations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through historian's agency (deciphering ledger), but the "noble lies" tension lacks a visceral price paid mid-scene; cost remains conceptual until the final act, slightly diluting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "compass needle sticks north" versus ledger's "southbound nights" reframes mercy as active reconciliation, avoiding moralizing while charging the final "Listen" with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("railway book blessed by monk," "ivy shakes out rain of seeds") modulates rhythm under pressure; only minor register drift in "method cannot be mistranslated into malice" slightly disrupts historian's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but "throatless platforms" and "moss-swallowed rails" risk overwriting in one beat; minor metaphor tension ("ivy whispering memory") slightly dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "noble lies" trope through specific historian lens and ledger mechanics; the rose-to-ledger parallel feels inevitable, though derivative echoes of Sebaldian historiography limit radical freshness.</comment>
