<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's synesthetic interiority drives micro-choices (pressing coin, speaking marquee letters) with embodied emotion; ghost's motivation lacks contradictory impulses but single-POV focus prioritizes narrator's earned endurance in "sweep[ing] the empty seats" with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through "coin cools... fades to a thread" with undeniable conceptual cost of temporary reconciliation; Accumulative lens holds perfectly as timeline fractures and sensory density reweight stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tarot coin functions as essential micro-setting: constrains choices (asking for direction), charges final image ("pockets the color of brass"), and its fading power shapes tomorrow's tactics—exceeding 9+ gate with concrete constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by narrator's agency ("anchor the Star," braiding names into wind) under Accumulative lens; visible cost in "blue bell fades" reweights fractured timeline stakes, though ghost's secondary pressure slightly dilutes dominant focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "memory fills him even as it releases him" and final "nostalgia swells brighter... like a house light" reweights longing without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence in the ghost's despair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("smell green cymbals, hear gold leaves") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; synesthesia as consistent POV filter avoids drift, taught early and paid off in closure's "heart the sound of home."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "blue becomes a bell I can carry, heavy but clear" achieves high density without muddle; final line variation ("pockets the color of brass...") demonstrates propulsion and textural specificity in peak closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through synesthetic specificity ("burgundy in the rafters"); "lantern fruit, apples bright as cues" offers fresh inflection where risk-taking heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry or clarity loss.</comment>
