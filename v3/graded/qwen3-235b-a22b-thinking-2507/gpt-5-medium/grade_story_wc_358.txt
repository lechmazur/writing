<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("borrowed authority and a vow") and embodied emotion ("glass pattern says they saw a ghost") deepen motivation; micro-choices like chalking arrows reveal hierarchy of values with cost ("air will be different tomorrow").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("air will be different tomorrow") under Accumulative lens; orientation perfect by line 3; lens taught early via "hazy precision is an ethic" and held through wind pattern documentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Container labyrinth actively constrains choice (wind corridors dictate landing tactics) and charges final image ("patch barely stirs"); "mothball sweetness" exemplifies sensory specificity filtered through investigator’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s wind documentation narrowing landing options; cost legible in "inventory what held and what almost failed" as air reconfigures stakes under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("charcoal lines become corridors") not moralizing; final image ("helicopter comes like a careful thought") reweights "foresight in action" with conceptual cost without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sodium lamps that have not slept") and rhythmic control under pressure ("ribbon tape flashes") teach pattern early; no head-hopping despite child’s brief appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frozen pond" metaphor integrates cause/effect; final line’s "reassemble its orders" achieves textural specificity without muddle. One dense sentence ("hazy precision is an ethic") narrowly avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of accident investigation with poetic precision ("singular convergence" as trapdoor); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming genre through lived detail.</comment>
