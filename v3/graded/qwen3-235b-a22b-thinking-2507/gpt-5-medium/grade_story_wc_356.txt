<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (ambition vs. fear of corpse flowers) drive micro-choices under pressure; final inhalation of grief's stink earns stewardship with embodied cost ("eyes watered"). No diagnostic label-speak; sensitivity manifests through actionable perception like translating flies' lesson.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: inhaling bitter stink reconfigures motion into equilibrium. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation (flies' lesson → bloom → silence), though "tide's thought" timeframe lacks active pressure. Cost proof solid via "village flinched as if truths had teeth."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Treetop bridges actively constrain choices (seed planted "at bridge's heart"), while recurring doodles charge closure as "map of breath." Sensory specificity anchors urgency: "nervous hymns" of pots and "jasmine and ash" tea show occupational plausibility. Environment directly shapes tactics via air-root cradle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: planting seed despite warnings deepens conflict into "rot is a road back to balance." Cost is unmistakable in bitter inhalation and village flinch. Pressure accumulates via flies' lesson guiding bloom, narrowing options to embrace grief's stink for serenity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: corpse flower's rot reweights grief as "perfume" toward equilibrium. Final image ("ambition softened into stewardship") offers resonant answer without moralizing, charging prior doodles as "map of breath." Avoids thematic echo; wisdom flows from flies' lesson, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through scent-based POV ("taste the world through currents of scent"), with rhythmic control under pressure: short phrases during bloom ("The beetles came, then the owls, then the silence"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during bitter inhalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dark as storm sap and heavy as an unspoken word" does double duty). Figurative language avoids muddle (e.g., "bitter" for first breath), though "tide's thought" borders on abstraction. Final line recharges motifs with concrete image: "ambition softened into stewardship."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms corpse flower trope via specific treetop logic: olfactory sensitivity enables translating flies' lesson into "rot is a road back to balance." Emotional truth in grief-as-perfume avoids genericity; doodles as evolving instructions feel lived-in. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
