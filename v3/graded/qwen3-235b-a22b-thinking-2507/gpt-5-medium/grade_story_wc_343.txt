<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "sociable isolation" versus sudden connection to hopscotch memory; embodied cost in "ribs were lantern slats" avoids diagnostic labels. Helmsman remains functional but thin, limiting relationship crucible depth despite pivotal trust moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "unaware that its smothered dawn had been persuaded" crystallizes the apprentice's earned role with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through pattern accumulation, with cost legible in "hands rang like bowls" during the luminance passage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dusty hopscotch board actively constrains navigation choices ("Nine meant veer"), directly charging the final image where "chalk, birds, and insomnia" resolve the luminance. Airship tools (sextant, kettle lid notes) evolve causally with events, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by apprentice's agency: hopscotch decoding narrows options from observation to action ("rang the bell softly"). Stakes deepen through tangible cost—"ropes unprickled" contrasts earlier "stranded luminance"—with moral calculus in risking the ship for discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "words themselves caught mid-utterance" reframes "charting discovery" as preserving language-light motion. Final image ("phrasebook corner pinned to the stars") resonates without moralizing, reweighting curiosity as active stewardship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "elastic bodies" of starlings and "compass dust on cheek"; rhythmic control sustains under pressure ("sliding the Petrel into the pale"). No head-hopping, with elision of crew dynamics taught early through "sociable isolation" motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "gauze soaked in mint" risks overwriting but pays off by merging sensory/tactile closure. Strategic density peaks in climax ("deck rings, compass, hopscotch squares agreed on figure eight"), though "pearly static that hummed against my teeth" slightly over-ornaments mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapmaking, murmurations, and hopscotch transforms discovery tropes; "sociable isolation" avoids quirkiness through concrete tools (kettle lid notes). Emotional truth anchors universals: "solved the rumor... by noting secret patterns" feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
