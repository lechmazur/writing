<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but lacks contradictory impulses; "closely attentive" trait isn't tested under pressure. Final endurance feels earned through stitching motif, but micro-choices lack visible stakes tradeoffs during pivotal ferry crossing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("warming the scars" reweights palimpsest promise), but cost legibility falters—scars reference past pain without present forfeiture. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, yet stakes remain abstractly thematic rather than viscerally constrained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fog and river actively constrain choices: current forces ferry correction, muslin-like fog mutes hooves, altering navigation tactics. Final image ("hills looked less like burdens") charges setting with earned transformation, satisfying 9+ gate via environmental constraint shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (palimpsest promise) deepens through map-stitching action, but lacks visceral cost escalation. "Scars" implies historical burden without on-page forfeiture; pressure tightens via river current yet fails to manifest tangible price beyond conceptual "warming," missing 8.8+ band requirement for visible cost charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through stitching metaphor ("braid it," "stitched storms into lullabies"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights erasure/return with "hills looked less like burdens," offering resonant non-literal answer—though "ancestral script teaching erasure" edges toward thematic statement, diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spindrift serenity," "gulls cry" needle) modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Voice consistency holds through elision ("thoughts began to percolate" → "meaning percolate"), but "palimpsest promise" repetition risks mannered lyricism without sufficient narrative friction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No paraphrase loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("water slapped the hull like a dog too tired to fetch"). "Percolate" repetition is pattern-taught motif, but "spindrift serenity" echoes verge on ornamental in final beats, narrowly avoiding overwriting penalties in peak closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving/navigation motifs transforms tropes: map-stitching literalizes "braid complexity," river currents as emotional metaphors feel earned. Risk-taking heightens stakes through textural accumulation, though "palimpsest" concept borders on familiar abstraction without sufficient grounding in tangible stakes.</comment>
