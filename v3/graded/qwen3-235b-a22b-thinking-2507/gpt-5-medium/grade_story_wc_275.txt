<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hands remember restraint" and "less than I would strike," but visitors lack individuation despite collective arc; micro-choices like sheathing the knife with soil reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "tend the roses... until the city learns" crystallizes cost with undeniable pressure; accumulative lens holds as rose's lean reconfigures stakes without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass dome functions as active micro-setting—constrains choices at thresholds and charges the hinge image; roses' thorns dictate movement, making environment inseparable from closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when visitors name "debts" and the rose leans toward scrap, deepening mercy's cost; agency lies in planting names, with visible price in her relentless tending until city changes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: sheathing knives with soil, planting names; final "breathing knives" image reweights blame without moralizing, avoiding false balance on father's choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mineral taste" and thorn angles; rhythm shifts from fragmented to flowing during the rose's movement, but "senselessly perceptive" slightly drifts into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed with exhausted hope" skirts abstraction but saved by "prayer stone" concreteness; final line "world threaded" achieves high-density propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via rose-farm mechanics; "breathing knives" concept feels inevitable through prior details, avoiding derivative safety with bold tonal risk.</comment>
