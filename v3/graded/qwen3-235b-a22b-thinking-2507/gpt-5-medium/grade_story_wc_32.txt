<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (stoic hands/heart hearing all) drive micro-choices like incremental salt adjustments; final snapping of crozier earned by embodied cost ("pressed my palm into the heat until my skin told the heat my name"). No therapy-speak, but bishop reflection slightly over-summarizes without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: crozier becoming ash while protagonist steps through gate with "cold flower inside my ribs did not wilt." Accumulative lens holds throughout, but "stifling destiny" backstory lacks on-page causal pressure in reflection beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains every choice (bellows speed, salt quantity); "warm pennies" sensory anchor evolves to "glassy blue" final image. Tool (crozier) charges closure as "hinge" and "ash," fulfilling 9+ gate with environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single stake (breaking doctrine's stranglehold) tightens through successive approximation, narrowing options to the snap. Cost legible in crozier's ash transformation, but "stifling destiny" remains abstract without concrete on-page consequence beyond the act itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crozier's metamorphosis: "dismantling is only room-making" resonates in final image of walking "with the care of someone who has begun to live." Avoids moralizing, but "frozen bloom" concept slightly over-explained in reflection beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("furnaces breathe in, ashes breathe out"); rhythm modulates from meditative to urgent during "crozier rolled an inch" escalation. Zero head-hopping; "warm pennies" establishes voice immediately with alchemical specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sparks lifted and swarmed like fireflies with broken maps" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Only deduction: "patient beasts" slightly ornamental in high-pressure beat, but rhythm remains taut through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes via "frozen bloom" concept; "successive approximation" as hinge mechanism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "warm pennies" simile borders on familiar sensory shorthand.</comment>
