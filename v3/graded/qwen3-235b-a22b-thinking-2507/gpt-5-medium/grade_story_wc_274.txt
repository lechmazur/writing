<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("faithful to preservation and starving for escape") drives the pivotal release choice, but peak-beat embodiment lacks visceral physicality during the duct insertion; heartbeat trace shows cost yet remains cerebral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "the dangerous liaison letter had become our common punctuation" crystallizes reconfigured communication with conceptual cost (heartbeat as sole trace), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through snow-cooked silence evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snow and library actively constrain choices (frost-furred brass, visor fogging) and charge the final image (frost blooming on case like curtain call), transforming environment into micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency (ritual of hesitation → timed release), narrowing options to "melt disciplined ice of my trade" with visible cost (heartbeat exposure), though escalation lacks one tangible tactical consequence beyond emotional risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars ("maintenance as courtship," bench becoming rendezvous), with final image offering resonant answer to central question without moralizing; "common punctuation" reweights silence as active language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost furred the brass like patient moss") and rhythmic control persist under pressure, though midnight release cadence slightly flattens ("fed the letter into the return duct"); no head-hopping, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("salted minutes, bent glances") with propulsion, though "obsolete clock pulses" risks register drift in climax beat; final line’s "held its breath" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archiving with political dissent ("desire mapped in cables") transforms tropes through specific logic; risk-taking (lyric structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry, though conduit mechanics verge on poetic abstraction.</comment>
