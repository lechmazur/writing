<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to resist historical erasure is embodied through concrete actions (speaking names, key insertion), avoiding abstract labels. Interior contradiction shines when she reimagines herself in the lagoon's surface, though the mother's voice lacks sufficient tension to deepen the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "quiet tension strong as cast iron wrapped in music," showing cost through the lagoon's ripple response. Orientation succeeds early with museum context, but "when plans unravel" timing lacks precise causality for the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (kneeling, speaking names) and charges the final image with "penny metal and rain on paper" specificity. Every sensory detail—from moth storms to wire-furred slopes—filters through Mara's urgent, tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through puddle-reflection map mechanics narrowing Mara's path, with visible cost in the museum captions' "sweating" consequence. Police siren's confusion feels coincidental rather than agency-driven under the Accumulative lens, slightly diluting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lagoon ripples rewriting history, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights "quiet tension" as resistance, answering the central question with the moths' "stubborn grammar" spelling vanishing without letters—no abstract thesis stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "puddles threw back a sly sky" and "wind played notes nobody could hear but her" sustains Accumulative rhythm. Voice modulates perfectly from archival stillness to lagoon urgency without syntactic slippage or filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "captions would now begin to sweat" shows with visceral efficiency. Every line advances atmosphere or character, like "moths thickened, a storm of soft bodies" compressing resistance into image without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "quiet rebel" trope through specific tech (phone key, coded freedom) and historical erasure stakes. Emotional truth in Mara's "harmless" guard interaction feels fresh, avoiding derivative safety with "tyranny of indifference" as lived reality, not jargon.</comment>
