<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "teach suffocating to breathe" risks over-articulation. Micro-choices minimal during pivotal refusal ("denied her quietly by standing still" lacks visible struggle).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands ("threshold steadied... I stepped aside") but cost proof weak; "ashes stayed bright enough to read" implies burden yet lacks concrete legibility. Lens (Accumulative) holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sanctuary constrains choices: fading threshold forces gaze fixation to stabilize it ("kept my gaze on her"). Final image charges ashes as readable record, meeting 9+ gate via micro-setting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (stewardship vs vanishing) tighten when threshold steadies, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; narrator reacts to shadows/girl rather than driving conflict. Conceptual cost felt but not visibly paid in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "burning bridges carefully" reweights into stewardship via "leave wood intact for travelers." Final image ("ashes bright enough to read") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ears ringing from long silence," "shadows careful as deer") with rhythmic control. Stress compresses diction ("She nodded, threshold steadied") without voice drift. Patterned elision taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor scaffold: "leaving can be an act of stewardship" over-explains. Zero loops; "smoke shapes trembled like winter birds" avoids figurative muddle. Closure image ("prepared scars") crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "burning bridges" trope via stewardship lens; "witness absence like lighthouse with hooded lamp" synthesizes risk/coherence. Fresh inflection in "teach suffocating to breathe" grows organically from scars motif.</comment>
