<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in carrying the unopened tin versus fearing what it might stop him hearing; Mira’s feisty presence forces micro-choices that reveal his flawed fatherhood without therapy-speak. One borderline thematic echo ("economies grow from gifts") slightly dilutes embodied emotion near closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the air tasted like the first bite after fasting" crystallizes cost of waiting with visible emotional restraint. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via vow-shedding pattern, but "deciduous vows" concept needs clearer early signal to reach 9.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard-as-setting actively constrains choices: copper wire splices rafters, bell rope’s fraying demands the ribbon’s use, and sap weight dictates pruning tactics. Final image of rainbows refracted by the quartz eye charges closure with undeniable environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency—pruning ritual narrows options from passive grief to active shedding—but "breach of contract" timeframe lacks live-clock urgency. Cost is unmistakable in leaving the tin unopened, yet secondary economic stakes feel under-dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: vows rotting fruit, ribbon-tied bell, and "accidental wisdom" final line reweight the premise without moralizing. Near-miss on 9.0 due to one borderline abstract line ("economies grow from gifts") that risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "quartz-eye mender" lens filters all description ("sap slurred," "stress lines through rafters"). Mira’s dialogue ("laughed like a dropped marble") contrasts perfectly with protagonist’s weary lexicon. Minor register drift in "unspent intention" barely touches peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "fruit lifted its shoulders, sap ran" shows via concrete verbs. Deducted for one paraphrase loop ("small tin and a missing laugh" followed by "afraid of what it might stop me from hearing") in early setup, but closure remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned church" trope through deciduous vows and quartz-eye mender specificity. Emotional truth in the father’s waiting avoids templates; every detail (peach-bridged ribbon, copper splices) synthesizes into inevitable, non-obvious closure.</comment>
