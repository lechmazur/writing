<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("breath leans close enough to braid with mine"), but micro-choices lack contradictory impulses; "scientifically romantic" love avoids concrete flaws under pressure despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through "revalue our ordinary steps" reconfiguration; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nautilus shell constrains choice as keel and charges final image ("curl back in its satchel"); ember air's "measured glow" evolves causally with the experiment, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence density) tightens through spiral experiment; cost legible in "presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry," though escalation lacks visible price paid mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "revalue what a second can carry" without moralizing; final image ("compass we forged together") offers resonant non-literal answer to "can presence be weighed?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cinders drift like migrating seeds") with rhythmic control; pressure modulates syntax ("wary as an animal, then settles") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "phosphorus chord on the anvil stone" shows textural specificity. Near-overwriting in "elemental tincture that asks me to catch something too heavy for air" barely avoids artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms scientific lexicon into emotional truth ("specific gravity of a look"); "directed spontaneity" resolves tropes through concrete lab-like ritual, with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
