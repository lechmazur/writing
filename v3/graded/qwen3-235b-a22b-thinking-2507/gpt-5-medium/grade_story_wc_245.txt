<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "did not come to erase grief, but to learn its native coast," with embodied choices like dowsing through touch. Final renunciation of escape for integration earns visible cost: "sorrow unfolds its chart without vanishing."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "stillpoint is not escape but axis" reconfigures grief with felt cost. Minor deduction for abrupt clearing entrance ("weaponed with silence") slightly fraying spatial choreography at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Platinum compass constrains every choice—from dowsing to translating notes—and charges the final image ("ring stops humming, map is inside me"). Ultrasonic forest’s bark syllables and lichen vowels drive action, not decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s agency: dowsing transforms scattered notes into melody, narrowing options toward "axis" realization. Cost crystallizes when sorrow "unfolds its chart without vanishing"—irreversible integration, not resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "map grows round, a planet the size of an ache" answers "navigate emotional depths" without moralizing. Final line’s "night steps with me" resonates as non-literal solution to grief’s horizon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tasting vowels that leak from lichens" filters world through tactile synesthesia. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("sweeping hand like needle seeking groove"), with lyric compression taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but minor scaffold loop in backstory ("Once I mapped river deltas... lines in my body refused the trade") slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise, relentless specificity: "coiled like winter in a seed."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and grief—mapping "isthmus of resolutions broken" via skin-language—feels inevitable. Risk-taking (ultrasonic forest as emotional terrain) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by compass mechanics.</comment>
