<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "stoically sensitive" remains label rather than tested trait. Final choice feels inevitable without visible struggle, though interiority is concrete ("boots remembering former thresholds").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "wait for the moment when what is gone accepts my witness without shame" crystallizes the surveyor's stance with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through patterned intensification of absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion functions as active micro-setting constraining choices (silt depth, rust-sealed doors), but "damp that smells like letters never sent" leans generic. Final bioluminescent image charges closure through specific tool (inkwell) and environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bearing witness to absence) deepens through note placements, but lacks visible trade-off—no moment where surveyor sacrifices opportunity for the mission. Agency in "wresting" doors and "mapping gaps" drives Accumulative pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" emerges organically from concrete acts (cataloging silt shifts, hinge-moan note), avoiding thematic echo. Final line "map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer" delivers non-literal answer to central question with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tripod coughs against balustrade," "daylight unthreads into coins") with rhythmic control under pressure. Non-standard punctuation taught early (e.g., "Stoically Sensitive") pays off in closure’s bioluminescent cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hushed blaze" metaphor maintains clarity while deepening theme. Every phrase multiplies meaning ("boots remembering former thresholds"), with final "drawbridge sleep like a huge eyelid" avoiding cliché through fresh syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms surveyor trope via "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" angle. "Hushed blaze" as restrained passion and specific graffiti ("Interlaced absence" as coordinate) elevate beyond flood allegory templates with emotional specificity.</comment>
