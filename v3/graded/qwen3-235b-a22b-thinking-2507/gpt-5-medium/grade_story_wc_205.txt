<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through poetic contradiction (starving poet vs. revolutionary), with embodied choices like pressing shard to temple. Micro-turns under pressure—public readings amid Ledger’s mockery—reveal hierarchy of values. But Ledger remains off-page foil; relationship dynamics lack on-page friction to deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: council revises archive while protagonist’s revolution stays "defunct, a futility minted in my bones." Conceptual cost is undeniable in the final image’s "sorrow shone, burnished." Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory density (shard’s song, covered mirrors)—but midpoint lens clarity wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid’s "veils of years" and oxidized iron ribs aren’t backdrop but active constraint: time-squalls dictate the mirror-covering ritual. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting, charging closure when it cracks—"tenderness bowed me." Every detail filters through the poet’s sensory bias, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (who owns history) tightens through protagonist’s agency: devising the mirror ritual escalates conflict into council showdown. Cost crystallizes in the council vote—"not as apology but as ornament"—and the visceral "futility minted in my bones." Escalation stays coherent under Accumulative lens, though Ledger’s off-page presence slightly dilutes opposition pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "ornament as ledger for debts canceled by beauty" reframes history as collective breath. Final image—"sorrow shone, burnished"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting the shard’s song ("we made... until making made us equal"). Avoids thematic echo; Ledger’s graphs contrast but never state the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "minutes rained," "covered mirrors sighed like sleeping swans" reflect the poet’s voice. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the council scene’s "hum of a thousand extinct hands." But minor register drift in "astromancers" slightly distances the focalizer’s revolutionary lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("herded," "recited," "cracked"). Final line’s "sorrow shone, burnished" recharges motif with precision. One figurative near-miss: "time’s veils ceased preening" risks personification clash but pays off in closure’s legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms archaeological dispute trope through "ornament as solidarity" premise. The mirror ritual synthesizes superstition into methodology, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity—revolutionary’s bittersweet victory—avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric structure over plot) deepens conceptual cost.</comment>
