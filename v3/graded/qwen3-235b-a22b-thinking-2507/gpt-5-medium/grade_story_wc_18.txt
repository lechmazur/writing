<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ilen's "worker of surfaces" self-conception grounds motivation, but contradictory impulses lack sufficient scene-layering. Noor's shaken breath reveals internal struggle yet remains underdeveloped. Micro-choice when Ilen steadies her rhythm shows hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of 'trap' for 'teach holding' is earned but requires more visible cost during escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost: "felt the brokenness as instruction, not shame" reweights the sextant's meaning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation to the final "seam bright as glass mountains." Cost proof is legible in erasing "boundaries only where harshness had pretended to be order." No causality breaks mar the pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ruined orchard functions as micro-setting where skeletal apples constrain mirror placement, and frost/fog directly alter tactics (breathing sync required). Sextant's "crooked arc" and "chipped lens" charge the closure by fracturing light into "silent bees" that lure the dream. Final image "fog kept a seam bright as glass mountains" recharges the opening's "shimmer of twilight frost" with earned meaning. Meets 9+ gate via tool constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency when Ilen counters Noor's wobbling breath with "counting orchard seasons," narrowing options to synchronized rhythm. Conceptual cost—redefining brokenness as "instruction, not shame"—is unmistakable in the sextant's final handling. Dominant stake (saving district from unraveling boundaries) tightens through the corridor's physical instability. Cost proof slightly abstract but charged by "cruel torn edges softened" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "teach holding, to erase the boundary between capture and care" crystallizes in the dream settling "as into a hammock." Final image reweights prior material by transforming "glass mountains" from descriptive phrase to earned metaphor for fragile connection. No moralizing—conceptual repricing occurs via "starless glint" threading frames. Resists tidy binaries by accepting broken tools as guides.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Ilen notices "frost like quiet ash" and "lenses chipped like a bitten moon," filtering astronomy through craft. Rhythmic control under pressure via breathing cadence ("Inhale... exhale...") modulates tension. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during corridor wobble ("mirrors tasting their own fear"). Elision of backstory taught early through salvaged sextant, paid off in Noor's whispered numbers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—each sentence advances texture: "fog climbed the trunks like the memory of breath" establishes atmosphere while implying temporal decay. High density in peak beats: "corridor wobbled, edges begging to split" compresses cause/effect without muddle. Figurative language ("constellation of silent bees") serves mechanics, never obscuring closure. Final line’s "seam bright as glass mountains" crystallizes motif with zero redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mirror maker capturing dreams via broken sextant transforms tropes through specific craft logic. Emotional truth in "teach holding" resolution avoids abstraction via orchard scent and hallway light. "Glass mountains" motif feels inevitable in hindsight, charged by frost/fog physics. Risk-taking heightens stakes (breathing sync as method) without gimmickry, though slightly safe in dual-character harmony.</comment>
