<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Guard's dreamlessness fuels embodied contradiction ("neither sleeping nor entirely awake"); final endurance as "placeholder for restored woods" earns cost through visible clock tick and refusal of resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "train rolls on, carrying its stitched together morning" crystallizes stakes with cost (clock's "wet as a tear" tick); Accumulative lens holds through humming-to-spore transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dune actively pressures choices (singing opens archive) and charges final image via reciprocity ("planting quiet inside my boots"); rail functions as micro-setting constraining movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single stake (containing archive) escalates through guard's agency: humming deepens into bottle-breathing, paying cost via clock's tear-like tick that alters tactics toward endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "seeds learning to be embers" becoming literal spores; final "stitched together morning" reweights renewal without moralizing, embracing complexity of cultivation amid erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("cold breaths of not yet brushing knuckles"); rhythmic control shifts from fragmented lullaby to flowing closure, with compression ("latch retreats") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; sentence variety drives momentum ("spores wink, then travel"); "wave functions" risks register drift but contextualized by signalman, avoiding closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms archive trope via "tendencies not pictures" and chess clock as game opponent; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes through "bottle of nights" causal pressure.</comment>
