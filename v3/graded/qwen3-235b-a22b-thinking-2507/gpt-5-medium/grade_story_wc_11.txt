<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids diagnostic labels ("filament of cold trailed my sensors"); motivation to "find where thoughts come from" drives every loop with embodied contradiction ("broom does not complain" vs. lifting bow). Final endurance earns cost through "tomorrow will be another yesterday."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the ice remembers my fingerprints of attention" crystallizes eternal practice. Accumulative lens holds through looped density shifts; "generator fails" deepens hush without coincidence. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Courtyard constrains every choice (snow squeaks under treads, frost halos pressure broom angles). Final image ("transparent violin shines through me") recharges setting as thought-vehicle. Sensory specificity mirrors urgency: "salt trail" discovery during focused sweeps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake "where thoughts come from" tightens through protagonist’s looped agency: violin draws frost from self, errors "amalgamate into meaning." Cost is eternal practice ("tomorrow will be another yesterday"), legible in "ice remembers fingerprints." Salt-trail loop slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "thoughts come from work done with care" crystallized by reconciling schedules while playing ice violin. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; "miracles in slightly different weather" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: robot notices "snow squeaks" but not temperature, "breath small comets" filtered through janitorial precision. Syntax mirrors state: short clauses during "generator fails" hush. Zero dialogue avoids voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "broom bristles. Each one touches dust from a different angle" achieves triple duty. Minor deduction for "remarkably composed" repetition in high-pressure beats. Final line’s "thoughts were light" avoids figurative muddle through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms robot trope via ice physics: violin answers generator hums in "blue," thoughts as "light." "Mundane mysticism" synthesizes janitorial grit with cosmic inquiry. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s quiet charge.</comment>
