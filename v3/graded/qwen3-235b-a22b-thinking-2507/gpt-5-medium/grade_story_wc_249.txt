<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "entangled memories were not a side effect... entire shape of love," with embodied cost in bruised arms and splintered selves. Final choice to carry donors’ echoes feels earned through prior micro-choices like drumming in blind spots, avoiding therapy-speak despite clinical setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Mira’s awakening with "strangers inside" crystallizes irreversible fusion, with cost legible in "we would not return to before." Accumulative lens holds throughout—sensory density builds toward the lagoon’s pupil-like widening, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The auric lagoon charges the final image ("carrying the lagoon in our chest"), while drumming on rails/gravel constrains choices (e.g., stealing blind spots). Gold dust and leafed speakers evolve causally with the bridge’s creation, avoiding static symbolism through tactile, goal-driven action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s drumming escalating to bridge-building, narrowing options to "carry what did not belong" for Mira’s return. Cost is unmistakable in "auroral sorrow" and irreversible fusion, with agency driving pressure under accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sound-as-bridge imagery: "teach time our rhythm" reweights grief as shared music without moralizing. Final image of "learning its music" offers resonant answer to "necessary for whom?" through concrete particulars (violin, coastline), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "knuckles chiming against rails" and "laugh sounded like someone learning to walk across a frozen lake." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("drumming on everything"), with patterned elision (donors’ memories) taught early and paid off in the lagoon’s widening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow spilling like confetti" and "pupil" metaphors charge momentum without muddle. Sentence rhythm accelerates during drumming ("soles tapping codes through gravel"), varying openings to avoid cadence monotony while maintaining clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms medical tropes via sound-as-connection: "whales write letters to seafloor" reframes entanglement as expansive. Emotional truth in "laugh cracked, yes, but it held" avoids generic templates, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
