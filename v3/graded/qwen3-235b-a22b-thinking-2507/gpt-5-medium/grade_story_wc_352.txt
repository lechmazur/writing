<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not gathering loot; I am composing patience" with embodied cost in "safes reopened in my ribs." Slight abstraction in "vigilance must root itself" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: "locks pause before accepting imprecise grief" crystallizes conceptual cost with undeniable pressure. Lens (Accumulative) holds flawlessly through inversion mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Grotto’s inverted gravity directly constrains tactics ("until the hour completes"), while the iron crown refracting sight charges the final image’s transformation of city locks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through embodied pressure: "drip that falls upward" tests vigilance, narrowing options to "look at the right absence." Cost is visceral in reopened safes becoming physical weight in the ribs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "locks pause before accepting imprecise grief" answers "where forgotten combinations hide" without moralizing. Final image reweights archival work as city-wide transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: noticing "bruise smiling" and "whisper arriving answered" embodies prism-mindedness. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("Air becomes syrup" compression).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clandestinely luminous pollen" shows textural density. Minor abstraction in "hard green" sprouts prevents 9.5+ but never obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Prism-minded" physics transforms archivist trope through gravity inversion. Every detail serves conflict: doodle’s "self-gnawing key" becomes essential to navigating grotto’s rules.</comment>
