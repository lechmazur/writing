<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between hunger for perfect moments and understanding its lethality is embodied in frost-script alignment and mother memory; micro-choices like unscrewing the seed reveal values under pressure with visible cost ("perfection weighed more than buoyancy").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "perfection weighed more than buoyancy" crystallizes the rejected path, while cloud sea "testing" roots makes the survival cost viscerally legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices (frost dictates alignment, press destabilizes systems) and charges closure through evolving frost patterns; "micro-setting" of bottled whisper directly enables the pivotal print decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by frost-script intensifying pressure narrows options to binary choice, but rupture initiation ("something chose rupture") slightly weakens protagonist agency; cost legibility ("clouds forgot motion") compensates under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "wobble, murmur, agree, and float" reconfigures "negotiable reality" without moralizing; final line "all awakenings must rustle" resonates as earned non-literal answer to perfection dilemma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost feathered inner bellies of glass apples") with rhythmic control during pressure; voice modulates from lyrical ("rustling awakenings") to urgent ("set the line") without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; single borderline personification ("cramped and shimmering, that wanted to compress eternity") avoids overwriting penalties as it serves Accumulative pressure buildup without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress operation with existential stakes feels inevitable; "bottled whisper" transforms trope through specific mechanics (prismatic seed, seashell patience) that heighten coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
