<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when the storyteller ignores fear about the curse ("a contract without punctuation") while sacrificing his name—a visceral, earned renunciation. Embodied emotion falters slightly in the "traders counting lies" vision, which leans toward summary over sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when the storyteller surrenders his travel-name, creating a "ringing cavity" with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the curse’s mechanics remain slightly opaque, muddying the stakes’ escalation at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting, constraining every choice—from aligning fractures with bird flights to warming "as if remembering a throat." Its tactile integration peaks when the storyteller presses it against the wall, feeling "a pulse like patient rain," charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via the storyteller’s agency: harnessing birds, sacrificing his name, and feeding the curse "dead names." But the "law and war" resistance lacks sufficient causal weight—the birds scattering feels like a thematic detour rather than a narrowing of options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "words worn smooth by barter" and the diamond’s "feathered fracture," avoiding moralizing. The final image—translating dust syllables into music—resonantly answers the central question of salvaging language, though the "treaty recited by stone" edges toward allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice achieves distinct perceptual signature: "a rasp like bark scraped by winter" and "thinner than silk" reflect the storyteller’s textural focus. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure, though "traders counting lies" momentarily drifts into abstract reflection without anchoring to present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural specificity ("fuzz at the edge of every echo"), but a template cadence loop in the bird choreography section ("Each turn... each dive... canyon answered") dulls momentum. No artifacts touch closure, sparing severe penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing linguistic anthropology with tactile translation—turning "heat trapped in summer bones" into sound. Risk-taking elevates stakes, but "copper-veined" borders on trope without deeper exploration, limiting the synthesis’s inevitability.</comment>
