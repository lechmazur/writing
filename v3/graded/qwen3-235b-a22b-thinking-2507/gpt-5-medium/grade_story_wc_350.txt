<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara's "vigorous tender" specificity shines in micro-choices (tying weight, gathering townsfolk), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her flaw-free empathy avoids genuine struggle despite "scars" mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (silos transformed into community), but cost proof fails—no exact line shows sacrifice beyond metaphorical "scars," weakening escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cuckoo weight functions as micro-setting, constraining bridge construction (counterbalance) and charging the final image; "borrowed starlight" motif evolves from atmosphere to active pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (isolation vs. connection) deepen via language interweaving, but cost remains abstract—"scars" of silos lack dramatized price paid, missing Band 8.8+ requirement for visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "braided" languages and bridges without moralizing; the final chorus reweights "siloed" history non-literally, but Q2's cost gap caps high-band eligibility per global gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gravelled rain," "rye-tasting exhale") and rhythmic control in multilingual dialogue; tension modulates naturally from "hush" to "gentle crescendos" without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("braided scale of do re mi"), but "borrowed starlight" repetition verges on scaffold in final beats, narrowly avoiding Q7 artifact cap for closure-adjacent lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms sentient machinery trope through specific constraints (weight counterbalance, rewired hoist); "interspersing languages" method feels inevitable, passing transformation test with emotional precision.</comment>
