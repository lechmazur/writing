<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s skeptic/lover duality and somatic misreads, but brother/father backstory lacks embodied friction beyond signal phrases. Micro-choices like breath-tap grammar reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, though grief’s physicality stays slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the tremor’s stillness and set-aside geode crystallize earned endurance with visible cost (softened shoulders, steady taps). Accumulative lens holds—static shock triggers density shift, but the "because" linkage feels slightly thin for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Light painting studio functions as micro-setting: the wand’s breath-count alignment and camera’s "drinking" of lines directly constrain choices and charge the final image. Geode’s dull planes reprise the opening’s "shard lit from within," making environment indispensable to closure’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through somatic markers’ escalation (misread rhythm → static shock → steady taps), with Mara’s brother/father memories as visceral cost. Agency feels passive in key moments—pressure grows from shared ritual rather than protagonist decisions, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "willowglass hope" reprise: final image rejects tidy resolution ("brittle brightness tempered by hands learning restraint") for earned ambiguity. Avoids moralizing, but "kindness is a method" borders on thematic echo, narrowly escaping penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: "threads of color throb across canvased air" filters reality through artistic sensitivity. Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress (short phrases post-shock), with no head-hopping—POV stability anchors the lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("rain mapped the windows with fractally precise veins"). Figurative language ("echo of his word curved like a bird landing in a pocket") deepens closure without muddle, though "minnows against glass" risks slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual through specific, non-obvious mechanics (somatic markers as grammar). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, but telepathy pill premise edges toward familiar "tech-assisted healing" tropes without full conceptual reinvention.</comment>
