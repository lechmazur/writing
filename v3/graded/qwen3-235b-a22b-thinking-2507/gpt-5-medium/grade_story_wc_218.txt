<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (work vs sorrow) acts simultaneously in scene through grafting and fatigue; final renunciation of timeline is earned by copper-wire choices. No diagnostic labels; embodied cost in "I began to tire" and otter-ramp labor. Slight abstraction in "hunger for pattern" dilutes physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: "silence arrived not as absence but as trust" reconfigures mortality with conceptual cost (death as "returning to woven map"). Cost is undeniable in the pillars' "slow chord" and otters' blessing. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly as density tightens stakes through copper-wire responses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Living stone pillars function as micro-setting that constrains choices (shading seedlings, widening paths for herons). Final image ("woven map") charges closure through prior particulars like volcanic pores and copper hums. Sensory hierarchy excels—sound dominates during high-pressure wiring, texture during fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remodeling before death) tightens through deepening density: pillars' responses narrow options (no second chances). Visible cost in "I began to tire" alters tactics (sleeping between rows). Agency is pure protagonist choice—copper wiring drives every escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme (reciprocal care) emerges through otter ramps and shell offerings, never stated. Final image "returning to woven map" reweights "final season" as continuity without moralizing. Epiphany earned via grafting labor—"architectural secrets were relationships"—avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "mineral leaves preferred almond pollen" filters botany through caretaker's urgency. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short phrases during storms ("copper lines hummed like harbor ropes"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via "doctors had spoken gently".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "brazen calm etched into errands" does triple duty (character, theme, rhythm). Closure beat ("pillars answered with slow chord") crystallizes prior motifs without muddle. Final line "woven map" avoids abstraction—recharges copper wires and diary entries concretely.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ecological care reframed as "tuning the orchard as an instrument". Specificity (volcanic pores, otter-ramp labor) transforms mortality trope. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—"silence as trust" feels inevitable yet revelatory. Near-echo of pastoral elegy avoided by mineral biology.</comment>
