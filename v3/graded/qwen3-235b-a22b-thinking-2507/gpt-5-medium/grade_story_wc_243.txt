<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "haunted euphoria" vs. "gently thorough" precision; the pink scar memory embodies conflict without labels. Final choice to step back earns closure through micro-choices like tracing plank knots, not dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: proximate causes deepen pressure until the locket's context shift ("background silver was here") crystallizes Charged Poise. Cost is palpable in "rope cut at night" backstory woven into tide rhythms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty's barnacles and thrift constrain choices—warm boards guide reconciliation, glasswort blooms charge the final image. Walnut ink browns paper "the way experience browns the voice," making tools charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through proximate causes (thermos, scar) narrowing options to micro-memories; cost lands in "ladder remade itself" as covenant regenerates via neglected details. Agency drives deepening, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through inked tide lines and locket context shifts, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("covenant would steep and hold") resonates non-literally, reweighting "preserving small moments" with salt-sealed cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "swallows stitched dusk to the sea" and "barnacles wrote blunt alphabets." Rhythm modulates from "low string" hum to urgent "click" of the locket under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "tide under our feet" to "patient ledger of foam" shows patterned density. Minor overwriting in "haunted euphoria" refrain (3x) deducts 0.2, but final line's precision ("absence agrees to be seen") salvages closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through proximate causes framework; jetty's sea thrift specificity avoids generic lyricism. Risk in making "regenerated covenant" tangible via thermos/scar earns freshness, though "covenant" phrasing slightly echoes templates.</comment>
