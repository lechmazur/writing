<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices like pressing palms to contain molting fragments; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values when spilling pennies for strangers despite impending identity loss. No stock phrasing—only character-particular textures like "ghost of copper on the fingers" grounding motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "beauty is not a treaty but a practice" crystallizes the resistance’s cost while the dented coffee tin’s page-turn sound confirms earned stakes. Accumulative lens holds through density shifts—wind playing fence-harp to lantern-lit aisles—without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rusted library’s ribs-as-stacks constraint shapes every choice, from feeding it "with found pages" to rebuilding the door from a refrigerator panel. Final image of "skyline with teeth marks" charges the setting’s evolution, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making environment charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: pennies spent on strangers narrow survival options while molting urgency forces action before identity loss. Cost is visceral in "pressing palm to chest" during personality cracks, though the "demolition notice" threat lacks sufficient on-page pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action—stitching spines with fishing line, clipping poems to twine—avoiding moralizing. Final line "practice until dawn" resonates as non-literal answer to "forge beauty from anarchy," reweighting the premise with the coffee tin’s page-turn sound embodying conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is indelible: "pockets chime with copper syllables," "wind smells like graphite." Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when molting fragments "glow and crack," with no head-hopping. Lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s "blue lid" metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels ("Lio wires a lantern to the battery and the aisles gather light"). Figurative language avoids muddle—"fence is a harp missing strings"—though "luminous fracture" slightly edges toward abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms vagrancy tropes through copper-syllable economy and prison-library backstory. "Blooming resistance" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with graphite-scented wind and coffee-tin map creating specificity that avoids derivative premise guardrails.</comment>
