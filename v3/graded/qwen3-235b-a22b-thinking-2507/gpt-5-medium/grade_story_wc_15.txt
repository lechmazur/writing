<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hauntingly optimistic, which is the same as stubborn" but lacks visceral struggle depth during pivotal socket-pressing moment; micro-choice of sewing names reveals values without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "water finds old channels" reweights "broken precedents" through the sluices' "wet exhale," making conceptual cost legible via sensory shift rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Red canyon functions as active constraint—mirror basins demand plate interaction, narrow script forces fingertip reading—directly shaping tactics and charging the altar scene where damp rock accepts gulls' vows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: rejecting "precedents say leave offerings" to press the plate into the socket narrows options to one irreversible choice, with cost visible in "nets stop grieving" and the town's stunned reverence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ruin taught to sing" motif evolving into "small, continual yeses," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "broken precedents" as communal renewal without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in marine metaphors ("anemones tuck in like closed eyes"); rhythmic compression under pressure ("I cannot breathe their absence without doing") sustains voice integrity through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops but "shy thunder" risks mixed metaphor; "orchid solace" slightly disrupts POV lexicon in final beats—minor register drift prevents 9.0 despite otherwise immaculate density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "sleepwalking paths" as navigational logic transforms labyrinth trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through charged specificity of "breadcrumb constellation" reweighted at pier's end.</comment>
