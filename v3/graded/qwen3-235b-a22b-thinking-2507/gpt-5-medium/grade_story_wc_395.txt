<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details ("flashlight everyone forgets," "coat still warm") with contradictory impulses (duty vs truth-seeking) driving the pivotal lie. Final choice risks job with visible cost, avoiding therapy-speak; emotional progression layers grief and resolve organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: "risking my job and the hush" crystallizes the cost of surfacing Aida's files, with the final patch photo reconfiguring "sensed absence" into active remembrance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pattern density escalates pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The archive’s "cold air smelling like old servers" and denim patch constrain choices (Sink access, final posting), charging the talismanic final image. Micro-setting (flashlight) evolves from forgotten tool to active symbol, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs policy) tightens when the lie unlocks the vault, foreclosing safe compliance. Escalation is protagonist-driven—following number trails alters tactics—and the job-risk cost is unmistakable in "risking my job," fulfilling Accumulative pressure through pattern deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the "largest lie was policy" realization reweights deletion as erasure, crystallized by "Still here, still counting." No moralizing—final image answers the central question through resonant action, avoiding thematic echo with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("archivists sweeping a beach at night") modulates rhythm under pressure—lyric cadence in Driftwood discovery shifts to staccato tension at the Sink. Patterned elision (backstory fragments) taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "watermarked by faint digits that rose and fell like a tide" exemplifies high-density prose advancing plot and theme. Final line "rerouting the stream across forgotten songs" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle, with syntactic variety propelling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms tech-noir tropes through specific grief mechanics (denim tributes, telemetry heartbeats). Bold lyric structure risks clarity but heightens stakes—Flight 7421’s heartbeat reprise feels inevitable, with "Still counting" caption charging closure through emotional specificity.</comment>
