<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("not by longing for heights, but by leaning into shore") manifest through micro-choices like weighing glass against palm. Flaw (fear of fire) compounds the brother's absence with felt cost in "hearts tethered to blackened beams," earning the quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the garland’s "layered hush" reconfigures light’s meaning against fire’s trauma, crystallizing the stake’s cost in "faces brighten without glare." Accumulative lens holds; mist’s "gentle handwriting" payoff proves disorientation functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sea glass constrains every choice—polishing stages demand patience, its "round as a heartbeat" texture shapes the method. Final image ("stringed ovals peopled by dusk") charges closure by making the grotto’s mist physically integral to the village’s healing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: each polished oval narrows options toward proving "safer" light exists. Cost is unmistakable in "hearts a little tired of gray days" becoming brightened faces, with the brother’s absence as felt consequence under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea glass’s transformation: "light to be held until gentle" answers the central question without moralizing. Final image reweights "safer star" as "gentle compass," avoiding false equivalence by honoring fire’s visceral cost ("sparks took rye roofs like gulls taking bread").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "breathe petal-cool softness like a compass" filters environment through character-specific urgency. Compression ("memories resurface with the rasp") is taught early and pays off in closure’s rhythmic control without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mist folds into glass like milk into tea" achieves crystalline clarity with layered meaning. Figurative language ("zephyr bloom unfurling") serves pressure without muddle, propelling to the final line’s resonant "gentle compass called homeward by breath."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "crafting light" trope through grotto physics: sea glass’s salt-tumble history makes patience tangible. Emotional specificity in "hearts tired of gray days" avoids sentimentality, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
