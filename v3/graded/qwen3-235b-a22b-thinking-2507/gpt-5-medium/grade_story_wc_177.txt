<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hunger" vs "patience of drought," with micro-choices like laughter as "grit" revealing value hierarchy; final choice earned through ritualized dream-interpretation, though drone's role slightly underdevelops secondary pressure despite thematic purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "wafer seal designed to fail" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through decaying directives to "become a direction"; no causality breaks, with storm pressure tightening options via barometer drop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker constrains choices as living "lung" that "inhales me," evolving from shelter to "satisfied" entity; final image of rain "like applause" charges closure by reweighting the rewilded forest as active participant in transcendence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake "why paths choose walkers" tightens through protagonist's agency—feeding dream translations to archive—yielding the eel-map's writhing; cost is unmistakable in "brittle promise that time would be stronger," though escalation leans slightly passive during directive decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "decaying directive" becomes "invitation," avoiding moralizing; final image of name as "direction" resonates non-literally with cosmic "grin" reweighted as "tired of being mistaken for fate," no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "thunder teach the river a new alphabet" and "damp margins," with rhythm shifting from fragmented ("lock is old, thin as a scab") to flowing during transcendence; zero POV leakage in single-POV lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wafer crumbles... communion of obsolete authority" compresses meaning with visceral rhythm; "precisely playful" recurrence is pattern-taught and pays off without figurative muddle, even in peak storm beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via "ethereal grit" and "decaying directive" as existential invitation; "some paths choose walkers because directives decay into invitations" synthesizes premise with emotional specificity, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
