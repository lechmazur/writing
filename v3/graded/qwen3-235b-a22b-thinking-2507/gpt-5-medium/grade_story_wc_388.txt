<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist’s contradictory impulses (truth-seeking vs. preserving communal hope) manifest in micro-choices like refusing the diamond while keeping the love note; final renunciation of myth for maintenance earns closure with visible cost in "everybody pays with breath." Caretakers’ reactions slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "liability exceeds projected goodwill" crystallizes the bill due in dust. Causal lens holds perfectly from liquidation to recalibrated storms; only "dreams came of orchards" edges toward abstraction without undermining cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Radiation storms and resonator-constrained calm zones actively pressure choices (e.g., stakes driven into failing nodes). Final image charged by orchard’s micro-setting: "fruit shone" directly results from recalibrated physics, not generic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. comforting lies) escalates through protagonist’s agency: shredded letters → resonator discovery → moral confrontation. Cost is visceral and causal: "everybody pays with breath" reweights prior choices under dust-storm pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from resonator mechanics ("truth is an irrigation line, not a sermon"), avoiding moralizing. Flawed diamond as "signature of every useful thing" embraces complexity without false balance; no thematic echo despite high abstraction risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "absence is a kind of presence" and "slicings are invitations" embody debunker’s lens. Rhythmic control under storm pressure ("dust storm came like a herd of hammers") with zero register drift; "recalibrated air" slightly over-engineers voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chewing the horizon into grit" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One hairline slip: "stuttering shredder" risks thesaurus-itis but "stuttering" precisely mirrors malfunction. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed object" trope through resonator physics; emotional truth in pear-blossom love note avoids gimmickry. Risk-taking (making math poetic) heightens stakes: "calibration" reweights "curse" through character-specific logic.</comment>
