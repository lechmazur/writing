<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices like delaying leaf-prod show restraint yet no internal conflict escalates pressure. Final transformation insight feels earned but cost remains abstract ("feel taller" lacks embodied stakes).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with ash sifting and "hearer" realization, but cost proof fails—no legible consequence for the protagonist beyond vague elevation. Lens (Accumulative) holds via leaf-pattern density, yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening beyond decoding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: arbor's leaf-fall dictates monument placement, moonstone refracts veinwork. Final image ("moss on my knees, newly arranged") charged by ashen skyborne micro-setting, fulfilling 9+ gate through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No escalation of stakes; protagonist passively receives prophecy without testing commitment. "Emerges transformed" stated but never risks trade-offs—folklore tension ("tree judges us") dissolves without consequence, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through monuments and leaf-grammar, avoiding moralizing. Final insight ("hearer transforms") reweights prior material non-literally, though grandmother's backstory slightly echoes thesis without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stippling air with faded green, bronze, ash-white") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from "hush" stillness to decoding intensity without head-hopping; elision taught early via leaf-patterns pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but paraphrase loop in "build tiny monuments" (repeated verbatim 3x) triggers -0.4. "Tasting river clay" slightly overwrites peak beat, yet density and closure image ("laughing under generous sky") remain unscathed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore and seed-sorting mechanics avoids tropes through "sparrow skull cairn" specificity. Risk-taking (passive prophecy reception) heightens stakes coherently, though "ashen skyborne arbor" borders on familiar mythic imagery without transformative depth.</comment>
