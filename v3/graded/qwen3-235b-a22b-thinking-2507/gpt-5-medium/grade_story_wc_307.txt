<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("study disappearance to be seen") drives choice; embodied emotion ("heart hurt") avoids labels. Micro-choice to release the stone earns vanishing motif, but protagonist's internal state lacks sufficient contradiction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with cost: "my heart hurt" at researcher's youth crystallizes irreversible sacrifice. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through pond rings' evolution. Slight ambiguity in "delayed revelation" mechanism prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's magnetic hum constrains choice (holds platform aloft) and charges final image ("grotto pulsed"). "Pond smoke" sensory hierarchy reflects urgency; sycamore-to-sparrow shift mirrors emotional resolution. Environment actively shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning vanishing) tightens via researcher's withheld knowledge. "Release the dam" choice forecloses persistence with visible cost (river widening), but escalation lacks sufficient protagonist agency—revelations feel gifted rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pond rings' transformation ("paths into breathing"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights vanishing as "gift of space" without stating thesis. Near-miss: "appear where your absence loosens the knot" edges toward thematic echo but stays earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("patience tasted of lake smoke") modulates under trance. Voice avoids therapy-speak; reverse-aging researcher's dialogue carries subtext. Slight register drift in "lineage" terminology disrupts otherwise consistent mystical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "stone fell like a syllable" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor overwriting in "tidy ribbon he refused to explain" slightly muddles causality. Final line's concrete action ("vanished where I hindered") resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of reverse aging + vanishing as spatial gift transforms familiar tropes. "Weight becomes a choice" crystallizes non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
