<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through dye-craft embodiment ("iridescent caution," "quietly explosive"), but the donor heart's "triple time" reaction lacks concrete causality for its pivotal shift, slightly weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via the final compass alignment, with visible cost in lifelong stewardship, but the indigo steam solution feels convenient without prior setup for disentangling stories, undermining escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing constrains every choice—tilting redirects narratives, illuminates grain, charges closure—and the tea house's bobbing ropes become embodied setting, perfectly meeting 9+ gate via tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Stakes deepen through sun-trail tracking as the dye master learns "magnetism was not greed but posture," with cost in the widow's near-burning by borrowed tales, though the indigo steam resolution lacks prior constraint to heighten agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (tilting wing, brewing steam), avoiding moralizing, though "magnetism was not greed but posture" slightly overstates the earned resonance of the final compass image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scales whispering gradients," "valley-mist wonder") with rhythmic control under pressure; the "borrowed pulse" motif teaches elision early, paying off in the donor heart's alignment without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but "ash lands on hearthstone" and "burn if pressed too hard" create a paraphrase loop in the widow scene, slightly dulling the closure's immediacy despite otherwise masterful density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye-craft and narrative magnetism transforms tropes; the floating tea house and morpho wing feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
