<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "quiver only resolve can fake" and backward pacing under stress; micro-choices like unstopping the shadow bottle earn the archivist's stance without over-articulation. Council's thin motivation slightly undermines secondary pressure within scope limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "cork the last of the corridor" crystallizes reversible exile with conceptual cost of "reluctant faith." Accumulative lens holds through tea-leaf patterns reweighting exile's possibility; disorientation waivers as the swing/bookend anchors closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chipped porcelain bowls constrain the tea ritual's pressure, and the swing's slowing motion charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery: "bruise-light" physically underlines archival margins, making environment inseparable from the archivist's choice to "sweep nothing away."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through accumulated tea-leaf evidence ("unsolved triangles") under the archivist's agency, narrowing options to demonstration. Cost is unmistakable in "stubborn kindness laid bare," though council's abrupt shift slightly softens the trade-off's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "recipes of remaining human" without moralizing; final line reweights "hush" into active vigilance ("awaiting the next knock"). Avoids thematic echo by showing resilience through the child's return, not telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("analyze geometry of tea leaves") sustains rhythmic control through high-pressure council scene. No head-hopping; "combative tenderness" lexicon stays within archivist's mentor role without academic drift during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "bruise remembering light" risks overwriting but pays off in shadow-corridor choreography. Final image’s "patient verdict" avoids scaffold, though "metronome for missing parents" slightly strains metaphor coherence early on.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through "reversible exile" physics and tea-leaf divination. Risk-taking elevates stakes: council's measuring tapes vs. chipped porcelain bowls crystallizes ideological clash without dialogue, making the quiet resolution inevitable.</comment>
