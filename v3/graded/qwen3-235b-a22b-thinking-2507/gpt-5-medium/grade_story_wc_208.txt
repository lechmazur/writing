<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses in action; "perpetually learning" stated not tested with cost. Micro-choices under pressure (pegging slats by whorls) show craft-specific values but no genuine struggle that alters the path. Grandmother/future girl silhouettes feel external to protagonist's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (vow to "build bridges out of broken weather"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered slide projections reweighting "passage" with felt cost. Orientation clear by word 20 ("GPS fails"), storm pressure tightens through one decisive deepening (lantern projection).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archway actively constrains choices (beaching skiff, building frame under rain) and charges final image ("gate of driftwood and light"). Driftwood's satin surface and grain directly shape construction tactics; storm-tossed setting evolves causally (anger "unspooling to rhythm"). Environment is the crucible for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("reimagine passage when markers vanish") signaled by paragraph 2, tightens through slide projection that reconfigures options. Protagonist's agency drives escalation (speaking to archway/sea), with visible cost in the vow's weight. Single deepening suffices at this length; conceptual cost legible in "journeys are scaffolds we become."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (building gate) not statement; "timewoven alliances" reweighted by final image as "grammar of joining." Avoids moralizing—closure offers resonant answer via driftwood gate as threshold "through storms." No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "knot we can always untie."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "reads knots like palms," "clams say thank you." Rhythmic control under pressure ("storm stitch me to archway's shadow") with patterned elision (time compression) taught early. Voice modulates from "turbine-hum reverie" to "satisfied hush" without head-hopping; lexicon stays craft-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("wind makes turbine-hum reverie"), but minor overwriting in "impossible filigree" and "ferric" taste. Zero loops/scaffold; metaphors serve pressure (storm as "threaded needles"). Final line ("broken weather") recharges opening GPS failure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope via coastal craft specificity; "timewoven alliances" synthesizes grief/cartography into fresh emotional calculus. Authenticity in driftwood grammar ("joints cut true and patient"). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure remains legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
