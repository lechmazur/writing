<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority reveals contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) through embodied actions like polishing the sundial; the final catalog entry for "shelter" earns endurance with visible cost in "hoofprints across gold" transforming into a word.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "word means a house built from echo" reconfigures the independence motivation through felt sacrifice (dripping atlas, thunder as "drums struggling to recall"), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens via density escalation to the herd song climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The brass sundial constrains choices (angling light to fix the knotted resonance) and charges the final image (hoofprints resolving into "shelter"), with tidal shelves actively spilling bookplates during the storm—environment as active pressure, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: thunder’s rise forces angling the sundial toward the nave, narrowing options to singing the herd song—a costly reconnection with extinct species that reweights the isolation/independence stake through dripping constellations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "door held kindly" resolves the independence paradox without moralizing, as the shelter word’s "hoofprints across gold" reweights earlier "brittle awakenings" into coexistence with tangible cost (damp constellations on wrists).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "cloudlight slides like water through letters" and "baskets dim with relief," with rhythmic control tightening during the storm ("thunder rises like drums")—no head-hopping, and elision of the "reincarnation memory" is paid off in the catalog’s earned specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "atomically reflective face" avoids register drift by tying to brass physics, while "damp constellations drip across my wrists" delivers high density without muddle—final line’s "translating weather into shelter" recharges motifs with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes via tidal mechanics and extinct species coexistence; the "house built from echo" synthesis feels inevitable through prior particulars (baskets, sundial reflections), with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
