<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (warrior seeking quiet), but core motivation "capture shape of possibility" remains abstract without concrete on-page stakes escalation; mother reveal powerful yet arrives late for full causal integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (gorget removal = abandonment of knight identity), but the "choose one shape" moment lacks visible struggle preceding kernel press, slightly diluting escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices (visor removal ritual, sap path navigation) and charges final image; "crucibles hung like lantern fruit" directly enables the kernel's revelation as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing possibility) signaled early but pressure buildup lacks protagonist-driven agency; orchard's actions dominate escalation, making the "choose one shape" demand feel externally imposed rather than earned through his choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "murmured allegiance" reframing duty, with final kernel-pressing image rejecting thunder for "mornings that require tending" – no moralizing, pure resonant reconfiguration of knightly identity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("equations spliced into bark," "sap score") with rhythmic control under pressure; single flaw: "tingled like static against the tongue" momentarily breaches knight's plausible lexicon with scientific phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exquisite density with minimal scaffolding, but "darkness flocked like velvet" creates a mixed metaphor (flocking implies birds, velvet is static) that slightly muddles the proscenium image during critical setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy/theater tropes feels inevitable through knight's puppet-troupe mother; "patient stars" and "mercury sap" transform clichés via character-specific stakes, though "statistics of miracles" risks thematic echo.</comment>
