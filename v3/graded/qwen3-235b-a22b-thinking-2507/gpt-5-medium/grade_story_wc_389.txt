<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "project and sin braided into one motive," with embodied choices like scattering seeds into lightning revealing weatherwork's cost. Brin's "rope-laugh" and charcoal eyes avoid stock traits, though the "sin" lacks deeper causality to elevate to 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the prophet "crawling across calendars" reconfigures hunger as direction with Knoll's revised allegiance showing tangible cost. Accumulative lens holds through fragmented radio pattern taught early; orientation anchors by line 3 with cobalt portico.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm pressure directly constrains choices (umbrella "useless," tuning in hail), and the cobalt portico charges closure when it "opened like a tide learning syllables" during seed-scattering—a micro-setting essential to the final image's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Knoll's visit forces crystallization of "shape a new dawn... not otherwise," narrowing options to weatherwork's success with Knoll's conditional support as visible cost. Stakes deepen as hunger becomes "direction" pointing cityward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "gritty whimsy" of crooked-spoon vanes and pepper-boiled ink, culminating in the non-literal answer: "radio sang harvest, clouds flashed archives, town listened differently" reweights weatherwork without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dials trembled like gossiping bones," "creek tasting winter") with rhythmic control under pressure; fragmented radio elision taught early pays off in the baptism scene. Zero head-hopping despite Brin's arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "antennae sprouted blue sparks like petrels pecking the gale" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only minor deduction: "lyrically prophetic" slightly elevated but justified by radio context—no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms weather prophet trope through specific "gritty whimsy" (crooked spoons vane, hunger as direction), with barometer prophet feeling inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional complexity edges toward abstraction at 9.5.</comment>
