<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("wistfully pragmatic" yet driven to act) manifest in micro-choices like saving cracked pots while climbing; final resolution to "root light" earns closure through prior causality with felt cost in "the living crash on unseen jetties."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when harbor "leans toward brightness" with cost legible in "the living crash on unseen jetties"; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (quivering hush, moon shoals) tightens emotional pressure toward earned stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lockmaster's tooth constrains pivotal lockpicking choice and charges final image ("root it at home"); harbor actively shapes tactics via "moon shoals on waves" guiding rowing rhythm and window reflections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (petals, tide, quivering hush) deepens emotional pressure; cost unmistakable in "the living crash on unseen jetties" foreclosing denial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of "watering alleys with light" resonates non-literally with opening "fire escape gardener," reweighting grief as generative action without moralizing; theme emerges from concrete particulars like brittle wick and patched skiff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in soil/lock metaphors ("read a lock the way I read soil"); rhythmic control under pressure evident in lockpicking's "measuring absence" cadence; elisions taught early (mother's illness) pay off in rowing focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences like "the harbor waits like a sleeping lung" achieve triple duty (image/atmosphere/theme); final line recharges "fire escape" with new meaning; minor abstraction in "protected vulnerability" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through fire escape gardening specificity; "rooting light" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
