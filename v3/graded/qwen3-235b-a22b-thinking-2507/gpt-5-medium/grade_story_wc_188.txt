<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (defying hopelessness through "serious playfulness" vs. gravity's weight) drive micro-choices like filtering burned smell from memory. Lark's thinness is offset by her soot-cheeked specificity and the knot's emotional weight as a relic, earning the pact's cost in the final "stubborn pulse" of the rag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("gravity loosen, not vanquished, but persuaded") lands with felt cost in the knot's "stubborn pulse" and children catching soot-seeds. Accumulative lens holds: density peaks in mortar placements, tightening options through wind funneling and salt mixing without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mosaic note and kerosene rag knot constrain choices (sequence mapping, fuel filtering) and charge the final image where blooms "retell this note." Sensory details like "jasmine poured down" reflect urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in navigation of the fortress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: wind pooling and wall echoes narrow options toward the launch. The "stubborn pulse" of the knot embodies cost, with agency clear in mortar placements that reweight hopelessness through "serious playfulness" under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "note in mosaic" reprise as "lesson set where petals can sing," avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights defiance as "prayer" and "instruction" without stating a moral, using concrete particulars (soot-seeds, ash-drunk blooms) to charge emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measuring air with feet," "chant while walking") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control ("flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger"). No head-hopping; elision of Lark's uncle is brief, paid off in the knot's "relic" weight and final tying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "filter the fuel through cloth and patience" (action, metaphor, cost). Metaphors stay coherent ("vine parted like shy fingers"), with final line recharging motifs without muddle. Propulsion accelerates cleanly during the launch sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fireworks as "serious playfulness" defying hopelessness transforms tropes through specific stakes (no-stars hush, mosaic instructions). Emotional truth in "gravity loosen" avoids abstraction, with risk-taking in accumulative structure heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
