<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fear could be a lever, not a lock") and embodied emotion ("palms clear with fear-sweat") drive credible endurance; final renunciation of isolation earned by decryption struggle with visible cost in "breath broke with the sentence, then reknit".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("unlocking shared name by speaking both versions") under Accumulative/Textural lens; persistent constraint of bone-dates lock shapes tactics, with cost legible in "apologized without excuses; I answered without armor".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rusted library functions as micro-setting that charges closure: skylight ladder's "steel box painted with rust" directly enables the bone-dates lock solution, while constellations on the cast constrain decryption choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's decryption agency under Accumulative lens; "fear-sweat" on the dial and "shaking hands" reweight vulnerability as power with felt cost, though secondary debt-hunters lack concrete on-page manifestation beyond the letter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("I would keep falling, but now toward us") resonantly answers "vulnerability is power" through action, not moralizing; brother's theft reconfigured as "breadcrumbs to outwit him... to join" avoids tidy binaries with earned ambiguity in "he believed I was stronger than the truth".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("memory scraping against sky") and rhythmic control peak in decryption beat; purposeful compression ("recited numbers, syncing them with constellations") taught early and paid off in closure's "spoke both versions" cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "syllables like rope over wood" risks figurative muddle in high-pressure decryption beat; otherwise high density with propulsion ("spun the dial, my palms clear with fear-sweat") and precise verbs ("smudged notes along the constellations").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt-double tropes through "cataloged fears like injuries" specificity; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes via "child's cast" as decryption tool, avoiding gimmickry with "Uncle taught me codes because fear needed maps" emotional truth.</comment>
