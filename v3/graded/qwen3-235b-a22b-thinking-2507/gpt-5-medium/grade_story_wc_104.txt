<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chained liberator" paradox; micro-choices like sorting keys under enforcer threat reveal hierarchy of values. Flaws lack safety-hedging—chain's weight as vow cost is viscerally earned. Slight deficit in secondary character depth limits to 9.2.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "both require tending" crystallizes conceptual cost of rebuilding with undeniable pressure. Orientation flawless by word 5 ("wall comes down"), causal chain holds through vault access. Cost proof irrefutable in final image's duality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival isn't backdrop but tactical constraint: plush impedes pursuit, piano bench holds keys. Micro-setting (arrow in gears) directly alters tactics. Final seed-distribution image charges setting with "cracked like lips" specificity meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing seeds) tightens via enforcer confrontation forcing key-sorting under pressure. Agency-driven escalation: Mara jams gears, decodes keys, distributes seeds. Cost legible in chain's "vow weight" and "both require tending" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "resilience in dry soil" motif; final seed distribution reweights it as "common miracle" without stating moral. No thematic echo—conceptual cost of rebuilding lands via "dry hills taking seeds like stories," satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("dust the color of old tickets"); rhythm modulates with stress (short sentences during gear-jamming). No head-hopping, psychic distance shifts intentional during key-sorting. "Staggering grace" repetition shows controlled voice evolution under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ribboned tickets that unwind like cocoons refusing to split" achieves density without muddle. Final line's "call it common miracle" resonates without abstraction. Hairline slip: "staggering grace" repetition in climax slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms seed-vault trope via drought-thread fletching and keys-as-chord mechanics. "Chained liberator" paradox synthesizes liberation/freedom tension into fresh emotional calculus. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
