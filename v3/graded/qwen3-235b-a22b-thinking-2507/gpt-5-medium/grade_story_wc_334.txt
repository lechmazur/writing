<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the admission about prioritizing work over the rope-holder, with embodied cost in the salt-sweet apple bite triggering memory. Flaws feel genuine without hedging, though the rope-holder's absence slightly weakens the stakes' immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the third writing of the grandmother's name crystallizes the memory trade-off with conceptual cost ("library that charged late fees"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned escalation, though the transition to surface feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse constrains every choice—chalk on slate, mirror angles, hatch navigation—and charges the final image with brined ledger warmth. Shipwrecks evolve from "hard horizon" to "creaking pews," making environment inseparable from thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the protagonist's agency: speaking the avoided truth narrows options (all-or-nothing memory recovery), with visible cost in the "late fees" admission. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens, though the tide turn's impact feels underweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brine-preserved apples and ledger corrections, not moralizing. The final "crisp nostalgia" reweights memory theft as active tithing, avoiding tidy resolution while charging the grandmother's voice as both gift and debt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Folklorist's voice ("hands-on," "rope/chalk/mirrors") shapes every perception, with rhythm modulating from graphite-smudged urgency to salt-bloomed revelation. No head-hopping; compression (e.g., "gull drifted... became her hand") teaches its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose sings with "rust blush" apples and "silt language" translation, but "shipwrecks creaked like pews" slightly over-ornaments the climax. Minor density in greenhouse description, though propulsion never stalls near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms memory-theft tropes through brined apples and fungal cartography, with specificity (braid knot vs. bowline) making emotional stakes feel lived. The ledger's double name correction is a fresh inflection that reweights the entire premise.</comment>
