<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between building bridges and accepting "touching distance" drives choices, but "haunted ambitions" stated rather than embodied in specific tradeoffs during node adjustments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost when the chime reveals transition can't be owned ("keep company as it bridged"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens with pressure reweighted through magnetic grammar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor actively constrains choices via "tired eddies" requiring node adjustments, and its "iron filings" directly enable the seed's sprouting—environment charging the final image of "new leaves testing magnetic wind."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's vocal harmonization deepens the dominant stake (preventing sparking rails), with visible cost in abandoned "haunted ambitions" crystallized when they "quiet, not erased" during the serenade reestablishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the seed's transformation from "fruit of silence" to sprouting life, with final image rejecting ownership of transition ("shared, always within touching distance") avoiding moralizing while reweighting the physicist's legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "barky pulses" and "magnetic wind" with rhythmic control during voice-rail harmonization ("vowels to water... reed hums"); patterned elision of spirit's departure taught early and paid off in vacuum-measuring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("work through analogical thinking... letting images bridge" followed by "Through analogical thinking I equate") slightly dulls propulsion in mid-beat, but zero figurative muddle in peak closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of cuneiform translation physics with magnetic orchard ecology feels inevitable; risk-taking with scientific lyricism ("arbor is a sentence with subject, object...") heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
