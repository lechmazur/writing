<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but abstract; "secretly sentimental" trait lacks embodied trade-offs. Contradictions (logic vs. intuition) feel theoretical, not pressured in key beats like flame lighting. Micro-choices lack tangible stakes—ribbon tying costs nothing. Final renunciation of formulas earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("roots remembered childhood"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—starlings' "theorem" deepens meaning without narrowing options. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; orientation clear by 50 words. Cost proof solid in "white thread of breath" dissolving into earth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/waterfall functions as micro-setting: bark maps constrain Iri's navigation, starlings' patterns dictate action. Final image ("colors calmed into single tone") charges closure with thematic weight. Near-flawless sensory integration—"nest of roots where flame could not reach" shows tactile pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonizing logic/intuition) signaled early but lacks visceral escalation—no live option foreclosed until climax. "Before final transformation" creates vague urgency without ticking clock. Cost ("roots remembering childhood") is poetic but not felt; agency passive as Iri follows starlings' patterns rather than wrestles choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: starlings' spiral as "map, mood, law" reframes logic/intuition. Final image ("fruit grew like thoughts, tart first, then generous") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality—grandmother's wisdom arrives via "math of birds," not abstraction. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("sound like seeds spilling" for laughter), but syntax stays uniformly ornate under pressure—no compression during crystal placement. Voice modulates beautifully with waterfall moods, yet "thaw were thinking" overreaches in high-stakes beat. Zero POV slippage; lyrical density taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "frozen dew crystal chimed faintly, a bell of winter inside summer" does triple duty. Minor artifact: "bark sighed as if clothing newly tailored" mixes metaphors. Template cadence in starling descriptions ("writing, erasing, writing") but redeemed by payoff. Final image ("auburn hair blazing in copper grace") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: "frozen dew crystal" as memory-keeper (not melt) reconfigures alchemy. Risk-taking (starlings as math) pays off with emotional truth in "balance" over triumph. "Fruit grew like thoughts" avoids predictable bliss. Only flaw: "final transformation" slightly vague, but specificity of root-memory cost elevates beyond template.</comment>
