<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (sextant as "habit and promise"), contradictory impulses (practical engineer vs. poetic hope-builder), and micro-choices under pressure (adjusting fan by "patient degree") earn the Earned Stasis closure. Janitor interaction reveals values through "shelter the buses" request, but intern's backstory as unpaid intern lacks visceral cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("terminal breathed out, I breathed back") crystallizes mutual restoration with felt cost ("proportional headaches of functioning mercy"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in flow corrections, though janitor's arrival edges toward coincidence rather than pure protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terminal actively constrains choices (water pooling in ballroom vs. dry corridors dictates rerouting), while sextant piece charges the final image ("warm against my leg"). Specific details like "confetti in vents" and "mold ruled quietly" avoid cliché, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by intern's agency (gutter rerouting, breaker flipping) deepens the dominant stake—functional shelter—through visible cost ("mops like standards"). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as flow corrections accumulate, with "proportional headaches" making conceptual cost unmistakable without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: sinks "speaking mathematics" and "arrows tuned to gravity" reweight "hope as engineered system" without moralizing. Final image ("breathed out/breathed back") offers resonant answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity through "functioning mercy's" inherent struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines via engineer's precision ("balancing gradients against distances") and lyrical compression ("windows mirrored dusk like paused galaxies"). Psychic distance shifts intentionally during high-pressure beats, though "functionally creative" label slightly over-articulates without immediate embodied cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: rhythm varies purposefully ("I flipped breakers to feed the archives" accelerates action), metaphors serve function ("arrows tuned to gravity"), and final line's cadence crystallizes closure. Every sentence advances story—e.g., "confetti in vents" compresses time/space without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering and hope ("budgets of mercy") transforms tropes through specific, verifiable detail. Risk-taking heightens stakes via lyrical precision without gimmickry—the terminal's "rehabilitated lung" breath feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
