<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("restrained wildness") and embodied patience-sculpting are vivid, but the girl's characterization lacks sufficient micro-choices to deepen the central conflict beyond functional dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "horizon closer than before," reconfiguring stakes through earned village action; minor cost legibility blurring in "slow thunder under the ice" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and viaduct function as micro-settings that constrain choices (sleeping on warm stone, rails pulling soles to steadiness), charging the final image with tactile specificity and environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the villagers' shift from ropes to salt-mending, but "doomed cattle" urgency feels underdeveloped early, slightly weakening the pressure arc despite the earned cost of unyoking fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through moon-path tracking and salt-mending as non-literal answers to "how to wait," avoiding moralizing; elders' phrase "patient revolution" risks thematic echo but is redeemed by embodied execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath plumes like banners," "swallows folded into shadows") creates rhythmic control; slight register drift in "moral calculus" exposition undercuts peak pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "fence posts" and "crackled with private music" exemplify textural density; "restrained wildness" repetition creates minor synonym churn in high-pressure beats, preventing 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "patient revolution" as salt-mending school transforms familiar trope through specific basalt/winter imagery; risks lyrical abstraction but avoids gimmickry via concrete village actions.</comment>
