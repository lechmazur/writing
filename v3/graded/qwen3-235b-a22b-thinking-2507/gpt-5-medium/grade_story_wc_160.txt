<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "water must flow/rock must sleep" tension, but councilors lack distinct pressure despite presence; micro-choice of naming no names reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in "tremble again, not from fear."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with felt cost in "delicate balance of receiving and refusing gratitude," but the child's envelope delivery borders on coincidence; "sugar bitterness" makes cost legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dormant volcano setting actively constrains choices via breathing rhythm (e.g., "colder rhythm" guiding slit discovery) and charges final image; "pumice-woven sluice" exemplifies tactile environmental integration shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonizing water/ash values) tightens through protagonist's adhesive analysis, with cost crystallized in "tremble again"; escalation driven by agency but council pressure lacks sufficient spatial choreography for full 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "encrypted compassion" mechanics without moralizing; final image of "gratitude traveling through pipes" reweights central question with resonant non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo despite "fairness is engineering" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("powder frets air like pale pollen") with rhythmic control under pressure ("tools rapping syncopation"); no head-hopping, and volcanic breathing pattern taught early pays off in closure cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brass link clicking polite applause" demonstrates high-density propulsion where every phrase advances atmosphere and character; no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like sugar analysis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms floodgate trope through "encrypted compassion" concept; sugar-adhesive analysis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
