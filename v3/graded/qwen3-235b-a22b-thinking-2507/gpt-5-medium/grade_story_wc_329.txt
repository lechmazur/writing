<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("empty as a bell awaiting a tongue"), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in climax; "gap between knowing" remains abstract rather than driving the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: statues bending to cradle the locust shell reconfigures meaning while "machines hesitated" proves conceptual price; Accumulative lens holds through sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard constrains choices (playing "resonantly soft" to avoid bristling), but micro-setting (locust shell) barely misses 9+ gate—charges final image yet doesn't actively constrain the violinist's last action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's heart-rhythm signaling narrows options decisively ("If I failed... orchard would seal its branches"), with cost legible in the city's embarrassed hesitation and statues' halos guttering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "beauty does not beg, it remembers" crystallizes in statues teaching "stone to dream," avoiding moralizing while reweighting the premise via locust shell's final cradling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("fog licks iron like a cautious animal"), rhythm modulates under pressure; minor deduction for three "translation" repetitions slightly muddling the orchard's response sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless density with zero loops; "resonantly soft" evolves meaningfully across beats. One repetition ("translation") in middle section prevents 10.0, but closure remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms mechanization trope via locust shell's specific logic; "breaking free as fuller attention" feels inevitable through heart-rhythm signaling, with emotional truth avoiding generic templates.</comment>
