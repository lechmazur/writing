<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("scattered memory keeper") manifests through micro-choices like swaddling grafts while gathering lullabies, but embodied emotion leans poetic ("courage fluttered like burlap") over visceral, slightly obscuring the cost of fraying communities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the shared-scar nod crystallizes "bound release" with conceptual cost ("debts I have not yet paid"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through woven-dawn reconfiguration without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mica window functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (loom/covenant), constrains choice via threading mechanics, and evolves from barrier to bridge—environment actively shapes tactics in graft-swaddling and dawn-weaving beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (rekindling realm via community voices) tighten through protagonist’s agency in harvesting lullabies/sighs, but the cost ("scars," "debts") remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in pivotal weaving moments, slightly muting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("knit communities by exchanging debts for harmonies"), with final image ("mirror answers") offering non-literal resolution to "bound release" without moralizing, resisting tidy binaries through shared scars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste of iron on memory," "hush like skirts") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "spider-silk and ash" swaddling beat showcases compression taught early and paid off in closure’s "drink" cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("woven dawns require threads from seventy-seven intact mornings") propels momentum, though "ferrying me toward the nursery" slightly drifts into ornamental lyricism in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "woven dawn" trope through alchemical specificity (beekeepers' "waxy laughter," graft-swaddling mechanics); risk-taking heightens stakes via mirror-world duality without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
