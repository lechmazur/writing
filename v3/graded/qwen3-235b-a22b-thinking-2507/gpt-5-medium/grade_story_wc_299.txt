<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("only measure, catalog, and price" vs. cradling the scrap) embodied through pricing decision; micro-choice to assign disproportionate value reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in final line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "Item carries memory load disproportionate to market" reconfigures appraisal rules with undeniable social cost; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (glue odor, cigarette singe) tightens pressure toward final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry functions as active constraint—holding sound like "a lung holds breath"—and charges the final image ("echo valley longing made visible"); mica puddles and grille cloth directly shape the protagonist's pricing decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: radio failure ("hollow where applause should go") drives quarry visit, and handling the scrap forces reevaluation of "confidently uncertain" professional identity; cost crystallizes in museum recommendation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "evaporated applause" and "quarry remembers" reconfigure grief as resonant physicality; final image offers non-literal answer to "after the applause" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice modulates under pressure—roadie cadence ("wrest amps from vans") shifts to appraiser precision—then fractures at "my hand knew exactly which cabinet"; Bowers' minimal dialogue carries subtext via "because the quarry remembers."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sick sweetness like old soda syrup" demonstrates textural specificity, though "confidently uncertain" slightly drifts from roadie lexicon; propulsion maintained through rhythmic variation ("Facts first, I told myself...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via quarry-as-memorial physics and appraisal profession; "echo valley longing" synthesizes setting/stakes in fresh, non-obvious final image without gimmickry.</comment>
