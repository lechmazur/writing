<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("eccentric" yet duty-bound) and embodied emotion in "weight settle now" power the closure; stranger lacks depth but isn't on-page long enough to require it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "accounting I had agreed to keep"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through dock notches and signal exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dock notch constrains choices (stems fitting wear) and charges final image; "opal sheen underfoot" avoids postcard description by enabling the key discovery beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when notch reveals inverted signal; cost of bearing witness crystallizes agency, but escalation lacks visceral pressure escalation in the middle beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "observing gaps" method and final line's "answer felt its way through"; no moralizing, only resonant answer to "did the gesture vanish?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dock knows my hands like kin"; minor register drift with "nautical twilight" but rhythmic control elevates pressure in discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "brittle into my palm" exemplifies textural specificity; slight density in opening ("gray vows") but no muddle in peak beats like the signal exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via dock notches and borrowed memories; "sign runs both ways" reweights Edelweiss with emotional specificity beyond symbolic convenience.</comment>
