<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in translator’s micro-choices: palming coral while "test[ing] translations under breath" to keep them "honest and warm," embodying the tension between professional duty and emotional risk. Final choice to gift coral earns closure through prior causality—its grooves previously "hold[ing] pauses steady" during mediation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "mother reaches for the uncle’s sleeve" after surgeon’s news, foreclosing prior hostility. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens via coral/cast density shifts, not plot mechanics. Surgeon’s entrance slightly convenient but cost (physical contact) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Brain coral constrains every choice: translator uses it as "punctuation" during tense dialogue, then gifts it as "lighthouse-sized" closure image. Mist-clad atrium actively charges the ending—"fog lower like a treaty we can read only by touch"—proving micro-setting necessity for 9+ band eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist’s agency: decrypting smudged notes reweights "shared anxieties" from abstract theme to tactical pressure (e.g., "hunger stitched between signatures"). Cost crystallizes when mother’s "dry-eyed" state shifts to sleeve-grab—a visible relational price paid under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: split storm cloud "with a word from Atapo sewn to a word from Reka" reconfigures "shared anxieties" as actionable stakes. Final image ("fog lower like a treaty") answers central question without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo penalty in critical last paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is Pacific-specific: "vents breathe like distant surf," "pelagic syllables," coral as "reef skeleton smoothed by years of thumbs." Rhythmic control under pressure—short, fragmented sentences during translation ("Here is hunger...")—teaches lyric pattern early and pays off in closure’s cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line multi-tasks: "monitors speak pelagic syllables" advances setting, theme, and rhythm simultaneously. Final line ("coral’s memory keeps speaking") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Propulsion flawless—"rain folds the night" compresses time while charging emotional aftertaste.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms hospital trope via Pacific conflict lens: "shrewdly innocent" child subverts naivety trope through culturally specific boat drawings ("Us/Also Us"). Coral as "dictionary of patient hurt" synthesizes setting/theme uniquely—no generic "peace symbol" could replace its textural weight in closure.</comment>
