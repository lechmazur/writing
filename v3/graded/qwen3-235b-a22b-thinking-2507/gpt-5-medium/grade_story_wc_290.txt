<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in claustrophobia vs. "stillness feels like a smaller room," with embodied tightness behind ribs during spatial shifts. Final choice threads key openly despite Council risk, earning visible cost through "wistful rebellion" as promise—not therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "mutiny was not refusal, only a hunger to be heard" reweights spatial rules through telescope image. Accumulative lens holds via organ reverberations tightening options, with "small theft" crystallizing the felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The compass point constrains every choice—from pricking tiles to glittering as witness—and charges the final image where "teeth meeting sky-shaped absence" merges tool, cosmos, and closure. Micro-setting mastery elevates beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering key amid spatial mutiny) tightens through organ chords that "uncrease the night," narrowing options to negotiation. Cost is unmistakable: Council opposition and "small theft" forcing "polite" exit, with mutiny's "hunger" becoming the earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spatial listening ("cobbles aligned like a held note"), avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights mutiny as "hunger to be heard"—a resonant, non-literal answer to the city's whispers, with conceptual cost in the Observatory's redirected telescope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature: "breath measured like a diver's," "alleys shifted like sleepers turning." Rhythmic control peaks in organ sequences ("pipes inhaled, then exhaled"), with compression ("prudently adventurous") taught early and paid off in chalk commas.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silt that had become more legend than mud" exemplifies textural specificity. Only minor density dip in "spatial mutiny" exposition, but compass/tile pricking immediately grounds it with concrete propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms spatial anxiety into "spatial mutiny" with fresh emotional logic. Bold risk in making city's rebellion a negotiable hunger—not obstacle—but coherence holds through organ/telescope resonance, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
