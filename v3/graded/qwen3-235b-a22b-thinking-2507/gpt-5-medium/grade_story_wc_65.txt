<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "trembling hand" versus "groundedly imaginative" mandate; embodied fear of hinges "sold or closed" avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated fear phrasing in peak decision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "page waits like ice" crystallizes stakes with undeniable pressure. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds flawlessly from spire hum to bead migration. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Obsidian spire's "heat trapped in stone" and kingfisher feather constrain choices (models on table, canal design) and charge final image. Micro-setting mastery: ice groans directly inform "reading fractures" solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake (constrained innovation) deepens through bead modeling; "hinges flex" tightening forecloses purity paths with visible cost (fear of misuse). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility slightly soft in canal design phase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hinge metaphor's evolution: "promise to move and return" reweights "writing the future" without moralizing. Final image ("prevail without vanquishing") offers non-literal answer to central constraint question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "snow scratched windows like quill testing paper"—cartographer's bias shapes all noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure: modeling section's short clauses contrast with lyrical kingfisher dive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "beads begin slow migration" does triple duty (action/image/theme). One minor density issue: "rehearsing thaw in slow thunder" slightly overwrites ice groan but pays off in closure's "fractures" motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms urban planning trope via "ignorance cartographer" lens; hinge/canal metaphors feel inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure for technical mandate) heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
