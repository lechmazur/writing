<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in fear of the telegram versus decoding drive; embodied emotion in "daylily rasp my knuckle" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to witness earns closure but lacks deeper flaw confrontation beyond professional dedication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "our voices did not cure grief, but they carried some weight" crystallizes cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout with variable stars' cadence tightening stakes. No orientation debt; lens taught early via "flux became syllable."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory tools actively constrain choices: sextant frames telegram opening, variable stars enable grammar translation. Final image "daylily kept its color... proof the sun can travel by paper" charges closure with micro-setting necessity. Environment shapes every tactical shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding via shared burdens) tightens through protagonist agency: reading light aloud forces Mara's counterpoints. Cost is visceral in "carried some weight from it together." Escalation avoids coincidence; pressure grows through braided voices narrowing options to conversation as key.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mirror-story pilgrimage reweights "shared burdens" without moralizing. Final line "healing travels fastest by ordinary words" skirts thematic echo but gains legitimacy through prior scene work. Resists tidy resolution with "midnight solace, not ecstasy."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("charts breathed faintly," "stars delayed their next beat") embodies astronomer-poet POV. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: technical lexicon ("Cepheid," "phase was tense") blends with lyricism. Dialogue distinct via Mara's urgency ("world bruised her with unsaid sentences") versus narrator's measured cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose density elevates momentum but risks overwriting: "midnight hush pooled" anchors voice, yet "glyphs like migrating birds" slightly muddles causality. Zero scaffold loops; rhythm varies purposefully. Final paragraph's thematic phrasing nears abstraction but saved by "bandage that breathes" concreteness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms trope of "decoding ancient text" through astronomer's lens: variable stars as linguistic keys feel inevitable. Emotional truth in "heal with words, not medicine" avoids sentimentality. Fresh inflection in "mirror as practice" reconfigures burden-sharing beyond physical object, charged by observatory's tactile reality.</comment>
