<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I told myself I was here to atone, but there was more," yet emotional progression lacks visible struggle during the pivotal foam insight; micro-choices like testing the chrysalis reveal values but the epiphany feels slightly unearned in the compressed arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—"ravine kept time for my first unbroken day" crystallizes the shift from brokenness to mending with undeniable conceptual cost ("birds would not bleed"). Minor deduction: the river foam insight's causality feels abrupt despite setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Braided ravine actively constrains choice: river foam patterns directly teach the polymer cadence, and the final image ties "unbroken day" to the river's rhythm. Micro-setting (chrysalis in palm) charges closure by embodying the mending philosophy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightens when "to atone is not to erase, but to keep listening" reweights the central conflict; protagonist's agency in observing river foam deepens knowledge to drive the design shift. Cost is unmistakable: "lawsuits... but gradual softening" with birds spared.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through river polymers as "orchestration," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("ravine kept time") resonates as a non-literal answer to "translate separation," reweighting atonement as listening without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded," polymers as "choir") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from clipped tension ("I could not bear a lab's confession") to lyrical resolution. Zero POV drift despite reflective density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion excels: "spitting out islands of sand and willow" compresses action/image. Minor deduction for "gleamed on patents" cliché, but final line’s cadence ("ravine kept time") charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science as symphonic mending avoids redemption tropes; pH-sensitive reversible rings ground emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
