<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s contradiction (seeking trust’s fracture yet paying for limes) manifests in concrete micro-choices under pressure, but Kettle/smuggler lack interior depth beyond surface tension during the pivotal fracture moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the "brittle inhale" reweights trust’s fragility, and the Accumulative lens holds through sensory tightening; sunrise timing anchors stakes without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rotting pier actively constrains choices (bare feet on timbers, limes as catalysts), with the fob’s tick and split lime’s "wet gasp" charging the final image; environment shapes every pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lark’s false starts escalate pressure through her agency (bargaining shifts narrow options), but the smuggler/Kettle fracture relies slightly on convenience rather than deepened character-specific history.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory action ("justice sounded like something breaking"), avoiding moralizing; the final line reweights trust’s transformation without abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tide tables and stains," fob as "careful conscience") with rhythmic shifts under stress; non-standard punctuation ("coins spoke, knives whispered") serves voice without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "wet gasp" exemplifies textural specificity, though "comforting unease" repeats without evolution. Figurative language stays purposeful and anchored to Lark’s POV.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "capturing ephemera" trope through tactile stakes (recorder as target, limes as fracture catalyst); fresh synthesis of sound-as-trust feels inevitable via pier’s creaking physiology.</comment>
