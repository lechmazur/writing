<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete actions (palette use, shutter press) avoids abstraction; final renunciation of capture earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in "luminous absence" realization. Slight over-reliance on thematic labels like "cipher of longing" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost: "Some absences must remain luminous" forecloses ownership after the sea's question. Accumulative lens holds through pressure-cooked imagery; "light as if handing me a quivering fish" makes cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Watercolor palette functions as micro-setting that charges closure—it drains "light to photograph to map" during the transfusion beat. Archipelago actively pressures choices ("path became a rumor of sand"), avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening when the sea demands "what price I set on waking," forcing stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing ownership of the dream) and legible in "absences must remain luminous," though physical stakes lack visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "pursuit can be gentle" resolves through action (releasing the dream), not moralizing. Final image ("my ink is water") reweights "capture" as "passage" without stating a moral, satisfying Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt footprints in the stacks," "stitch glittered") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control in closure ("I am a librarian, but my catalog is sunrise") avoids ventriloquism; elision of fishermen's dialogue taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "palette wells until they shone like held breaths" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final image’s simplicity ("my ink is water") balances earlier lyricism, though "dialect only the surf could translate" risks slight overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "chasing dreams" trope through specific mechanics (light-capturing photography, archipelago as whispering books). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "fugitive heart" phrasing slightly echoes familiar motifs.</comment>
