<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "sharp gentleness of seeing too much and not enough," embodied through hive-touching and breath control. Teacher reflection anchors present choice without summary, but "why places resist change" motivation edges toward thematic echo despite strong micro-choices like water sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "last of her water" expended, ribs "like kiln walls warming without flame." Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as thrumming "spread through dead stumps," reweighting "resist change" with tangible depletion. No orientation debt; lens taught by midpoint via timeline braiding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Faded lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (catching sun angles) and charges the final image (cups placed where timelines converge). Chimney smoke detail remains atmospheric without tactical pressure, capping 9+ eligibility despite otherwise vivid sensory hierarchy rooted in potter's tactile focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: her "small lights" (water dish, singing) intensify thrumming, tightening the dominant stake (understanding resistance to change) through visible cost ("last water," emotional vulnerability). Price shapes tactics—using breath moisture for water proves irreplaceable tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "hand that steadies a hive/child/itself" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image reweights "resist change" via "practicing it gently," charging prior fragility with earned wisdom. Avoids thematic echo by having glass "answer with moving light," not abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in potter's tactile lexicon ("palms quiet," "pinched small cups") and rhythmic control under pressure ("air began to thrum... spread like roots"). Lyrical compression taught early via "fractured timelines," paid off in closure’s "shawl of times." Zero POV leakage despite timeline shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "She lifted the faded lantern glass, and the sun braided three threads through it" achieve triple duty (character/action/image). Final line’s "warm and precisely woven" crystallizes closure without muddle. Minor risk: "fractured timelines lived here" edges abstract but grounded by "hairlines in glass."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" transforms scientific concept into emotional logic with irreplaceable specificity. Synthesis feels inevitable—lantern glass revealing timelines grows from potter’s clay philosophy. Bold risk in quiet closure pays off via "resisted change by practicing it gently," avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
