<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied contradictions ("fog trapped in a jar" pressing outward), but locksmith lacks depth as catalyst; micro-choice of singing reveals hierarchy of values (voice as cracked vessel vs. desire to connect) with visible cost in "warmed" tongue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise where mirrors form cathedral and mother's idea returns; cost legible in "cold that had held my tongue and warmed it." Orientation clear by line 3; accumulative lens holds through singing act reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Broken mirrors function as micro-setting charging final image (showing "rooms where I had hid my wanting"), but "shadowed nexus" remains postcard-like; hair constrains choices across beats yet environment doesn't actively pressure tactics beyond symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through singing act—voice shifts from "prisoner" behind teeth to wavered note searching "hallway"—with felt cost in thawed silence; agency-driven under accumulative lens though "fear" antagonist remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image ("sky hummed in answer") resonantly answers central question without moralizing; theme emerges through hair's reweighting ("thing that grew without permission"), though "idea of return" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("shards bright as wet teeth"), rhythm modulates under pressure ("sang a note that wavered, searching its own hallway"); no head-hopping, though "hush of cosmic possibility" slightly disrupts voice modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("daylight thinned to violet" anchors time/mood/stakes), but "enveloped secrets" risks register drift; crystalline final line offsets minor overwriting in "improbable longing."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith metaphor with emotional liberation (singing loss into beginning), grounded by specific detail ("mother cursing softly during combing"); avoids cliché though "fear as lock" premise lacks radical transformation.</comment>
