<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wanted more than safety; I wanted to find the thread," with embodied emotion in "bearing stormlight as if it were a shy animal." Micro-choice to tuck letters under the bowl reveals hierarchy of values through tactile action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: lovers' convergence at the bowl crystallizes options with visible cost in their hesitant steps and the trembling nest. Orientation anchors instantly ("lotus temple rising from a massive lily pond"), and accumulation escalates via the bell strike triggering convergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The thrush's nest spiral constrains choice (blueprint for thread-laying) and charges closure by trembling as connection occurs. Lily pond reflections braid visitors' identities into the setting, evolving causally when petals become "rotating fleets" that guide the lovers' path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the installation's mechanics: threads laid for "wary feet" narrow options to convergence at the bowl. Cost is unmistakable when lovers "stepped closer" after months of silence, with the unsent letters' physical weight making relational price legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the thread motif reweighted at closure: "rejoin became a simple act of holding a shared sentence" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing connection through braided reflections and trembling nests rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "prismatic quiet" observations and rhythmic control under pressure ("children who invent ceremonies for the frogs"). No head-hopping; first-person intimacy modulates from patient lantern to breath-bound thread during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "raindrops beading along lotus petals, each droplet a tiny window" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Final line "arm by arm, like reeds remembering how to stand together" charges closure without figurative muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the "love letters" trope through the thrush's nest as organic blueprint for connection. Risk-taking in making whimsy tactical ("unlocks doors caution cannot find") heightens stakes, though the lotus temple setting edges toward symbolic convenience without deeper transformation.</comment>
