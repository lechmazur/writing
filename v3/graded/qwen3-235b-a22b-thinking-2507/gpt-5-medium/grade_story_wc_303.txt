<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ilya's embodied conflict—'mulberry ache of decision bruise his ribs'—shows contradictory impulses (empire's paycheck vs. the dream) through concrete micro-choices like tightening the bow. His plant telepathy isn't exposition but active pressure (ferns' 'damp and green' warnings), and the final choice to play earns closure with visceral cost: dissolving violin on his tongue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens: the violin's dissolution crystallizes Ilya's stance with undeniable conceptual cost ('damp strings and breathing leaves'), while the 'city answering' reweights propagation's stakes. Orientation anchors by line 15 (observatory/midsummer/Ilya's role), and pressure intensifies via noon's approach without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Midsummer heat isn't backdrop but active constraint—melting the violin and tightening Ilya's choices. The velvet dome 'swallows sound' affecting the music's propagation, and the coffee cup's 'galaxy of brown' evolves into a prophecy device. Final image ('damp strings and breathing leaves') charges the setting with closure cost, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archive vs. propagate) tightens via the noon deadline into a single, earned choice. Ilya's agency drives escalation—spilling coffee, tightening the bow, playing—under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the violin dissolving. Empire's threat ('anesthetic smiles') lacks concrete in-scene pressure, slightly blurring the antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: 'music propagate like pollen' becomes tangible as vines thrumming and coffee stains 'recognizing star maps.' Final image ('city answering') offers non-literal resolution—memory surviving archival erasure—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in 'sap' and 'cold fire' tastes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: plant telepathy filters observation ('frill of thought, damp and green'), and syntax tightens under pressure ('sun like a thousand brass coins poured'). Voice modulates from lyrical ('velvet eating sharp edges') to urgent ('play us the map'), with zero POV slippage. 'Mulberry ache' slightly drifts from Ilya's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or stakes ('perforated by heat and song'). Closure image ('damp strings and breathing leaves') crystallizes meaning with perfect density. Minor deduction for 'perforated destiny' repetition bordering on muddle, but no artifacts dull the final beat's resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms provenance tropes via plant telepathy and ice-violin physics: the empire's 'vacuum the dust of its story' reframes archival violence. Fresh synthesis in 'coffee stains recognizing star maps,' avoiding safety middle by making propagation visceral (moss carrying rhythm to gutters). Derivative empire motif elevated by specific stakes.</comment>
