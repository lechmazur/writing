<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lio's hope-testing questions versus restlessness; embodied emotion via "ribs carry a small river of feeling" avoids cliché. Final renunciation as "knot-maker" earned through specific omissions like unmailed letters, though external/internal contrast lacks subtle variation in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: Lio's realization of own omissions ("letters I never sent") reweights echoes as entanglement. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—progressive disclosure tightens pressure into the debt-web revelation, with "silt crown" image making cost visceral. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Whispering shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: it enables the mother's voice return during the pot song. Sensory hierarchy masterful—"reed-blown melancholy" filters canyon sounds through Lio's profession, while silt crown visually embodies the "debt door" metaphor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Lio's agency under Accumulative lens: each question ("Who keeps you?") deepens the debt-web pattern, narrowing options from seeking single threads to accepting entanglement. Cost is legible in the shell's reflection showing "faces I left lightly," altering Lio's final stance with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete particulars—debt web, pot song steam, shell's mica light—with no moralizing. Final braided voices reweight "why echoes persist" into non-literal answer: echoes endure through "knots" of obligation. Avoids thematic echo; mother's forgiveness dramatized via steam-carried songs, not abstract sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ears richly perceptive" yet "truer hearing where ribs meet") shapes every observation. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in stone's refusal: "three seconds that cut my chest" uses cadence to embody cost. Lyric compression taught early ("progressive disclosure") pays off in closure's crystalline final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "water speaks in sand-syllables" achieve triple duty (sound, texture, metaphor). Final paragraph's "doubled tone" image recharges shell motif without muddle. Figurative language sparse yet potent ("crown of silt lifting"), avoiding overwriting even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "echo" trope into intricate debt-web premise where echoes persist through social entanglement, not physics. Fresh synthesis via specific verifiable details: drowned fire's shell, pot-song steam. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—closure image feels inevitable through prior particulars like "borrowed shawl" voices.</comment>
