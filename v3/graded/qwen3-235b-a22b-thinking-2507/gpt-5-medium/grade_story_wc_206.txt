<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("wilt near dishonesty" vs strength from truth) drive the pivotal confession beat where knuckles become rain then steady; the shadow trade-off manifests embodied cost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the shadow's nod among rafters crystallizes the covenant's terms, making the light's fragility ("if people ceased to listen") viscerally legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tuning box functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its wooden lung bellows "remembering lullabies" directly enables the light's return and later constrains the protagonist's nightly mending duty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via density shift: the rust's "rivering chord" question intensifies the dominant stake ("all light is borrowed") through the protagonist's visceral confession, narrowing options to truthful sacrifice under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shadow trade: "light as borrowed instrument" resolves the central question via the final image of cupped light and "ears generous," avoiding moralizing while charging the covenant with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile horology terms ("hairline hurts in music," "springs that hold grudges"); rhythmic control tightens during the confession beat where "knuckles to rain" becomes "strength returned like a key finding its ward."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops but "almost grateful" risks slight abstraction; "lunar flecks" and "copper veins" maintain textural density without muddle, though "hush that tasted like tin and pears" edges toward ornamental in the relief beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "mending" from repair trope to philosophical act: the non-obvious synthesis of horology, shadow sacrifice, and "tinkersong wonder" creates inevitable emotional truth through specific, verifiable stakes ("light as borrowed instrument").</comment>
