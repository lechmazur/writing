<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: copying silence versus teaching dust stories, embodied in "tapped pencil on the shelf" to establish common time. Final promise to "carry tempo forward" earns endurance with visible cost—vigilance against fragility. Cinder’s motivation stays slightly opaque but not detrimental.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise: sweeping the floor "careful not to erase drafting" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost—the dust’s fragility ("now fluent, now shy"). Orientation anchors by line 2 ("ember alcove in mist"). Minor escalation dip as payment demand lacks one subtle prior hint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ember alcove actively constrains choices (copying in darkness, cloaking radio glow) and charges the final image ("mist leaned against the brick"). Body-as-setting (hands copying silence) shapes tactics. "Soot began to articulate its weather" exemplifies pressure through environment. Near-perfect but ash-scattering feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: copying makes ash articulate, then promising to "carry tempo forward" forecloses passive listening. Cost is visceral ("breath is our hinge"). Payment demand arrives abruptly without sufficient escalation—minor flaw in Accumulative pressure buildup despite strong agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "rake cinders into vowels," dust "breathing measure." Final image of sleeping narrator with dust telling stories offers non-literal answer to storytelling’s fragility. Avoids moralizing—no thematic statements, only earned resonance. "Thistled calm" motif doesn’t fully charge closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: musical metaphors ("tuned rain," "phrasing silence") filtered through copyist’s expertise. Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato during tuning ("hissed like a teapot"), flowing when dust articulates. Zero head-hopping; Cinder’s dialogue stays within broadcast’s constraints. Masterful control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phrases fell like sawdust" evolves into "dust lift into phrases" with purpose. Final line resonates without moralizing. Minor flaw: "secretly luminous" appears twice without sufficient evolution, slightly muddling peak beats. Otherwise, high density with clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "story famine" transformed through tactile musicality ("sift consonants from soot"). Emotional truth in "dust respects diligence" grounds the conceit. Avoids ruin clichés via copyist’s precision. Slight echo of standard post-apocalyptic imagery in ember alcove prevents 9.5+.</comment>
