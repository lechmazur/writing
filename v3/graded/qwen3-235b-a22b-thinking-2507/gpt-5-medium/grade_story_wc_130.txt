<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not reunion, but coherence") and embodied emotion ("folding silence into scarves") shine, but sister's disappearance backstory slightly summarizes rather than actively constrains present choices despite strong micro-choices like fruit-spiral arrangement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "carries a theorem he cannot solve but can carry" crystallizes stance with felt cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout via sensory density tightening meaning, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern orchard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: mineral blossoms constrain his ritual, stalactite rope becomes "memento and intention" in sleeve; every detail (ticking water, cooled-tears fruit) pressures choices toward final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coherence vs. ambiguous loss) tightens through Accumulative escalation: fruit arrangement → rope-knotting shows deepening acceptance; cost legible in "hinges stop squealing" remaining unachieved, though early stake signal could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "love equals attention multiplied by time..." reweights math metaphor into embodied wisdom without moralizing; final theorem-carriage answers central question with resonant ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mineral sweetness," "fractures using buttons") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in "angles of missing tesserae dovetail with constellations" teaches lyrical compression paid off in closure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fruit glistening like cooled tears" exemplifies high-density imagery that advances theme; final line's "theorem he cannot solve but can carry" achieves propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through specific "mathematics of emotion" frame; fresh inflection in tying glass eyes to stalactite as "tailor who mends a dress designed for a storm" synthesizes loss/optimism inevitably from prior details.</comment>
