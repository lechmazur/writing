<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitude vs connection) manifest in grinding pigments pre-dawn while accepting neighbor's soup; final renunciation of artistic isolation earns through tactile causality ("felt her hand steady mine"). No label-only emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: grandmother's postcard crystallizes "night is gentlest daylight" through prior sensory accumulation. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via scent/silence pattern until the hinge turn at twilight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Etched glass constrains every choice: protagonist must press palm to pane to feel "hush like a cat between rails," directly shaping the mural's creation. Final pavilion's honey glass charges closure by refracting light through inherited wisdom.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (understanding night-bloom) deepens through protagonist's agency: waiting for twilight draft to "read scored line for the throat" narrows options from seeking to receiving. Cost is quiet endurance becoming connection, visible in final panel placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pollen lamps" and "gloved hands" bats reweight night as courtship, not rebellion. Final image ("murals were doors") answers central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("draft braided itself through glass layers"), though "verger" terminology slightly drifts from artist POV. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in thunder-as-dark-petal construction; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "thunder formed without rain" compresses expectancy with crystalline diction. Minor overwriting in "meaning might too" (0.1 deduction), but propulsion never stalls toward closure's felt cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes botanical observation with cathedral mechanics into fresh "umbral tenderness." Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "amber pavilion" risks cliché until transformed by grandmother's card.</comment>
