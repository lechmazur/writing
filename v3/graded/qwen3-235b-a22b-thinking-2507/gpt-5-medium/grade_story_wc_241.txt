<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between caution and intellectual thrill drives micro-choices; "felt a tug, a lucid contradiction settling like a bird" crystallizes earned stance shift with visible cost of her father's fragility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: lantern's refracted raindrops reweight risk as stewardship with undeniable cost in "years of watching him lose little to stay afloat"; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mica pane's evolving significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mica pane constrains choice by refracting rain into discrete coins that charge the final image; "clover along the curb steamed" makes grief tangible while environment actively shapes the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: subway scrawls demand interpretation that narrows options to Martingale alcove, with cost legible in "widen perspectives responsibly" as she trades absolute caution for measured risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights prior material non-literally: bus departure with "odds change, mercifully and slowly" answers central question of risk stewardship without moralizing, embracing complexity through the library's receding "numbered squares".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in "rain teaches gutters to sing" metaphors; rhythmic control under pressure ("tracing arrows, primes, and queerly serifed A's") taught early and paid off in closure's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ink bloom like sea anemone" achieves high density without muddle, though "lucid contradictions are my compass" slightly strains in mid-beat but recovers with concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of probability theory and emotional reckoning feels inevitable; "candle lantern heart" transforms gambling tropes through specific mica-pane physics that charges the closure without gimmickry.</comment>
