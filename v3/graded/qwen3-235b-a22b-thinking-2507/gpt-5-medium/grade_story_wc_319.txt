<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("dimensionally homesick" vs "ache is companionable") and embodied micro-choices (offering empty hands, practicing interiorizing) earn closure. Guardian’s "tenderness taught by wolves" avoids stock tropes but "misfiled season" risks over-tidiness in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "day is thinner for a breath, but it holds" crystallizes fragility of new stance. Accumulative lens holds through patterned intensification (frostbite reading, interiorizing confession) without causality breaks. Syllabus on sleeve reweights stakes with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen garden constrains choices (waiting as binding, mist writing syllabus) and charges final image ("carrying thresholds like books"). Sundial’s "arrested shadow" evolves causally to become memory. "Ice accepts a leaf" avoids cliché by linking to captured motion, but vellum/salt sensory details slightly over-index visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative pressure: "dimensionally homesick" → "carrying winters" → "pressure of other versions" narrows options toward waiting as binding. Guardian’s river question forces trade-off (follow stream vs belonging elsewhere), but "uncertainty exiled me" lacks concrete early signal of this dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects (pendant’s tithe, sundial’s confession) not moralizing. Final image ("uncertainty sits beside me") reweights "making friends with uncertainty" with conceptual cost—no tidy resolution. Avoids Thematic Echo but "foggy lucidity" syllabus risks near-pedagogy in final beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("light pools like breath on glass," "winters clinking like secret glasses") modulates under pressure. Frostbite reading lesson shows controlled psychic distance shift. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early ("unwritten books and off-season stars") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops but "dimensionally homesick" repeats verbatim (para 1 & 6), dulling momentum in high-pressure beat. Otherwise exemplary density: "waiting is not inaction here; it is binding, like thread pulled through a wound." Final line’s "uncertainty sits beside me" avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through "feral guardian" and "unwritten books," synthesizing dimensionality with emotional specificity ("benches sharing cold"). "Interiorizing exteriors" as fresh inflection grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
