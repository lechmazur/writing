<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied grief (measuring dream dust with teaspoon) and contradictory impulses (repair vs witness), but "quantified sorrow" risks clinical distance; micro-choices like excavating mortar earn the Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: abandoning measurement for listening ("heard the register of their quiet") reconfigures the premise; Accumulative lens holds perfectly as density shifts from dust to tags to tree witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sextant and teaspoon function as micro-settings that constrain choices (aligning crack with root seam, measuring dust) and charge the final image; moonlit tower pressure evolves through rain-to-dawn shifts with lived-in tool use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (grief quantification) tighten through the pin-drop moment, narrowing options to excavation; cost is the irreversible shift from measurement to acceptance, driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (tags as "minutes," dream dust), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights time/sorrow without stating a moral, though "quantified sorrow" phrase slightly edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("labyrinth sighed like a sleeping boiler") and rhythmic control under pressure; non-standard punctuation (dashes, fragments) serves voice, with elision taught early and paid off in closure's quiet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "milk blue breath" during lightning risks slight overwriting, but density remains high; no loops or scaffold in closure beat, with strategic telling compressing transit effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "quantified emotion" trope through tactile specificity (tag weights, teaspoon); fresh synthesis of grief mechanics and tree witness feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
