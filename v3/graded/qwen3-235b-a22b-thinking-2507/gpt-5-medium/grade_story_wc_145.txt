<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not brave but subtly confident") drives valve-turning choice; embodied fear of "taming what should remain wild" charges closure. Flaws deepen without hedging—competence balanced by genuine struggle with the map's moral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: rivers' "long handshake" reconfigures singular convergence with felt cost (fear of taming wildness). Accumulative lens holds—condensation patterns tighten pressure toward crystallized stance. Cost proof: "Part of me feared the map I would make" directly precedes valve turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake constrains choices (cracking ice, hesitant footsteps) and charges final image ("lake resumed pretending to sleep"). Condensation pattern functions as micro-setting—literally guides navigation and reweights closure. Environment shapes tactics: walking "into reeds that clacked their teeth" reveals the culvert.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding river origins without destroying wildness) tightens when turning valves: "Part of me feared the map I would make" forces trade-off between knowledge and preservation. Agency drives escalation—breathing on glass, prying locker—culminating in the cost of moral ambiguity made visible in the ledger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of listening vs. naming emerges through concrete actions (chalk marks, fogged glass), not abstraction. Final image ("let the stove speak for me") reweights "singular convergence" as a "long handshake" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality—wisdom arises from "water that begins as one must learn to part again."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dry-witted atlas editor") colors all observation: "girders hummed like teeth pressed tight," "snow whispered over iron." Rhythmic control under pressure—"Veins met veins, rivulets accepted their siblings"—avoids syntactic monotony. Elision (falcon's report) taught early and paid off in culvert discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "water gathered, not loudly, but with a seriousness that can be mistaken for calm" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("sound like relief") remains legible in peak beats. Final line ("atlas breathed differently") recharges opening motif without muddle—closure image sharpened by specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mapping trope through specific synthesis: rivers "voting" as "quorum of thawed decisions" feels inevitable. Fresh inflection in "singular convergence" as quiet consensus, not thunderclap. Authenticity anchors universals—"phrasebook dog-ear curled like a pet"—avoiding safety-middle abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
