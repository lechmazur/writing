<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "steely longing" vs. desire to derail scripts; micro-choices like winding the silent clock reveal values. Lacks deeper struggle against his own clockwork nature in peak defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "schedules bowed" crystallizes defiance with felt cost ("last train delayed"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through compasses' flickering reconfiguring options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (broken anniversary clock) charges final image; tidal arbor foam ropes constrain navigation. But "ropes of foam" lack pressure on tactics—sensory detail outpaces functional constraint in key moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when film hiss carries "last train held" announcement, forcing pianist's continued playing as defiance. Cost ("last train delayed") legible but escalation relies slightly on coincidence (signal shiver) rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("schedules bowed to the encore") resonates without moralizing; "timetables could be loved without being obeyed" emerges from chords leaning toward memories. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle and whispering like shells") with rhythmic control in "keys stitched from postcard ivory." Pressure modulates voice without elision—film threading beat shows syntactic compression under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "hiss came a distant announcement, delayed and breaking" achieves high density. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent ("resonant reconfiguration") but voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of station/time tropes via tidal arbor's kelp-like choices. Risk distinction (+0.3) for transforming schedules into sensory stakes ("steely longing"), though compasses verge on familiar metaphor.</comment>
