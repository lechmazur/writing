<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "repair as rhythm he could only borrow," but blind spots/mistakes lack tangible manifestation; "driftwood nostalgia" grounds emotion yet flaw struggle remains abstract without mid-crisis irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with palpable cost: library's partial thaw ("creak like old boats") crystallizes the protagonist's realization about transience, perfectly serving the accumulative lens through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen library functions as micro-setting constraining choices (rime lectern, softened gloves), with gear assortment charging the final image as "steadying heart"; "clouds" detail lacks tactical pressure to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency—uncapping bottle to align clocks with tide rhythm—reweights the stake through sensory density; cost legible in library's fragile thaw, though tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificed tool) would elevate closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "tide inhaling and exhaling the shoreline of brokenness" reweights repair as cyclical rhythm, avoiding moralizing while resonating in the final "trade of attentions" image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyelash click of springs," "kelp-like ribbons of vellum") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift in "precarious gravity" slightly undermines POV consistency during high-stakes mirror approach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion maintained through textured verbs ("shiver," "uncurled," "nudging"), though "hush and the tick agreed" risks borderline figurative density in a pivotal beat without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "repair" trope via time/memory mechanics; "locks as questions wearing metal" and tidal rhythm feel inevitable. Emotional specificity elevates, but "driftwood" metaphor lacks fresh inflection to breach 9.0.</comment>
