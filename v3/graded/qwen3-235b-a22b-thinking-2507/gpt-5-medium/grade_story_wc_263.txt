<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("brass chilled and calibrated by sleeplessness") but micro-choices under pressure sparse; sculptor interaction lacks prior relationship stakes. Contradictory impulses ("gift or curse") present but not tested in pivotal failure moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("sometimes I fail... instrument rest without argument"). Accumulative lens holds, but lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3) prevents 9.0. Cost proof clear in "stars scratch wrong" consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway and instrument function as micro-settings constraining choices (alignment mechanics); final "bridge of notes no rain can erase" charges closure. Environment specificity passes 9+ gate through tangible tool constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing creativity) tightens through deepening perception ("hear unspoken words braided with frost"). Agency fits Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks visible tactical shifts during failures; cost legible yet passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "remembered stardust" motif reweighted in closure ("city remembers its stardust"). Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; avoids thematic echo in sculptor's wordless carving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky breathes in colors that whisper") with rhythmic control under pressure. Compression taught early ("calendar that had no dates"); minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" phrasing prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density but template cadence in "I align... I copy... I know" (three adjacent "I" stems) dulls closure beat. Overwriting in "hive discovering spring" metaphor; artifacts prevent 8.8+ per Q7 cap rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's block" trope through cosmic lens; "shadowed rapture" and unwritten calendar feel fresh. Emotional specificity in sculptor's "dustless cheeks" avoids abstraction; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
