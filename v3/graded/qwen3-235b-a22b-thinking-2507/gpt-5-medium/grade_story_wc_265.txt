<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ruin teaches what perfection hides") and embodied emotion ("waking always hurt") power the choice to repair the gear, earning the conceptual cost of realizing translocation is pedagogical. Slight thematic echo in "practical with mysteries" nudges below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "wild frontier" redefined as "interior distance" with felt cost in "waking always hurt." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density shift at gear repair ("time unraveled its snag") reweights stakes through pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gear constrains choice (repair decision) and charges the closure image ("the second... spun softly"). Mechanical rainforest details like "bark stamped with serials" and "aluminum palms clinked" actively guide navigation, avoiding ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: hum shifting from "counsel to ache" forces repair choice, narrowing options to confront fear of perfection. Cost is unmistakable in "realized the wild frontier did not mean escape"—a conceptual price scaling perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: gear repair yields "interior distance" insight without moralizing. Final image ("miracles did not flare; they ticked true") reweights "probable miracles" with conceptual cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "vines breathing steam" and "forest spoke in parts and bearings." Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure: short sentences during repair ("I pressed the gear home") contrast lyrical observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "river of mercury beads" and "ticked true" achieve high density without muddle. Final line ("world had filed its teeth") charges closure with vivid specificity, avoiding overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mechanical forest trope through grounded details ("library stacks made of grates"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—the gear’s evolution from "missing tooth" to "pupil become teacher" feels inevitable.</comment>
