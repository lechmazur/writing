<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses in key moments; scholar's passivity limits earned change despite vivid embodied emotion ("nicked by paper" scars). Micro-choices reveal values yet final renunciation lacks tangible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("let language breathe... become discovery"), but Accumulative lens escalation lacks meaningful deepening—pressure accumulates without narrowing options. Orientation clear by 40 words, yet one tightening insufficient for high-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Library functions as micro-setting: crystal’s sonic reflection and dust constellations constrain testimony method. Final image charged by tool ("tilt of memory"), though environment rarely pressures choices beyond atmospheric weight. Misses 9+ gate by narrow margin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding growth patterns) signaled early, but conflict remains observational; pressure tightens via crystal’s revelations yet scholar’s agency passive—no trade-offs or tactical shifts. Cost conceptual but lacks visceral legibility at closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fractured sequences" of light/sound; final image reweights premise with social cost ("become someone else’s discovery") without moralizing. Epiphany earned via concrete particulars ("bruised permission," "roots negotiate dark"), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust becomes constellations of practiced neglect") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision taught early (index cards as fragmented testimony) paid off at closure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from hush to testimony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("crack repeats, not echoing but breeding"). Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("river reversing under ice") but no closure muddle. Opening/final lines recharge "suspended hush" motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic/organic growth ("old sentences sprout green modifiers") avoids tropes. Risk-taking (testifying via crystal tilt) heightens stakes coherently. Transformation test passed: swapping "dictionary" for "encyclopedia" breaks emotional specificity of language migration.</comment>
