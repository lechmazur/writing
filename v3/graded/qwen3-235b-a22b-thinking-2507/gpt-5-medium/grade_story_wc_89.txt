<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "reluctant as dawn" versus acceptance; embodied cost of losing "plain speech of markets" earns closure without therapy-speak. Mira’s practicality ("asks the price") forces tangible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: spice grinding intensifies texture until "beasts begin to sing," culminating in Charged Poise where bond "hums, paradoxically steady" with visible cost of lost voice. Orientation flawless by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Orchard actively pressures choices—beasts approach mortar as bell, apples constrain vision—and charges closure via "dew inside the apples." Micro-setting (mortar, fortune slip) directly shapes metamorphosis tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through spice intensity: grinding "last thorn of saffron" narrows options to metamorphosis as sole path. Cost of voice loss is unmistakable when "I lose the plain speech of markets," driven by protagonist’s choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (spice-naming, fortune slip as treaty), not abstraction. Final image—"quiet star threaded through two throats"—resonantly answers "bond beyond death" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "grammar of breathing with things that do not breathe"; rhythm modulates from frantic grinding to calm "paradoxically steady" repetitions. No head-hopping; Mira’s dialogue filtered through protagonist’s sensory lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm ("I choose the first" vs. "wind braids itself with steam"). Figurative language serves clarity—"saffron to vein" charges closure—without muddying metamorphosis cost in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "beast whisperer" redefined by "syllables learned from rivers." Cosmic intimacy through spice-naming ("reckless joy of naming spices with our eyes closed") feels utterly fresh, not derivative.</comment>
