<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "questions rust in my mouth" versus obedient building, but Mara's absence limits embodied flaw demonstration; final choice to "draw the first line over my heart" earns closure with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "path we etched will hold like a seam" crystallizes refusal to recover Mara while accepting walking "with her," with cost legible in "remaps the ache" and "raw solace" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The censer foot as micro-setting constrains choice (must be fitted to stop station's shivering) and charges closure as the needle's "trembles like a bird relearning sky" reweights loss through physical object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when beacon points inland, forcing agency through the compass build; cost crystallizes as "every step remaps the ache," narrowing options to walking the loss itself under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through "vowels on driftwood chips" becoming "notes on wood begin to speak in rain"—zero moralizing, with final line "follow it home" reweighting migration as shared journey without stating meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "hydraulics fail exhale steam like a wounded animal learning to breathe"; compression taught early pays off in closure's "compass will sleep... quiet as ash," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt pans mirror every star that forgot to burn out" achieves density without muddle, final paragraph's cadence shift ("In the morning...") propels closure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "reverse migration" trope through drowned chapel censer foot and "vowels on driftwood" specificity; emotional truth in "Mara kept singing so I could follow" avoids generic templates.</comment>
