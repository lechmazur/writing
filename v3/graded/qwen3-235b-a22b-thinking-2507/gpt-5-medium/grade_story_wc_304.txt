<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through profession-specific choices ("cleaned the cold from her skin"), but the single-character constraint limits relationship dynamics. Final choice to seal the chip feels earned by prior causality with palpable cost in "the right angles of her bones." Micro-choices under pressure consistently reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly when "I was unshaken and remade" crystallizes the threshold concept with cost in the mentor's physical absence. Orientation is flawless by line 3. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the radio static breakthrough, though chip mechanics slightly obscure causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto actively constrains the ritual (aurora's light required for the chip), while the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details like "aurora murmured like cloth rubbed on crystal" reflect the mortician's professional bias without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake "to capture one last spark" tightens through protagonist's agency in tuning the radio and infusing balm. The cost is visceral in the transformed mentor's mask-like face, reweighting stakes under the Accumulative lens through sensory density rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sculpt grace out of grief" becomes literal in the balm application. Final image "a shawl of air" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the "threshold of stillness" concept through embodied loss rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers trained to calm chaos") modulates rhythm with ritual intensity. Purposeful compression taught early ("threading constellations from snow") pays off in the radio static sequence. Zero head-hopping; every image filtered through mortician's professional gaze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "stone holds a pulse, a tremor waiting at a threshold" do triple duty. Final line recharges opening motif perfectly. One hairline slip: "recalibrated it for her" slightly vague technobabble in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortuary science and aurora physics transforms "threshold of stillness" from cliché to visceral concept. Emotional truth in "Let them meet themselves kindly" avoids sentimentality through specific ritual actions, with risk-taking heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
