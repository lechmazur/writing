<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete details like chalked sleeves and salt-singing backs, but "relieved mathematics answered with mercy" risks diagnostic labeling at peak tension. Micro-choices (thread-tugging, constellation names) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "coordination, gentle as flint dust" reconfigures cosmic imbalance with undeniable conceptual cost ("only rebuilt an echo"). Orientation clear by line 1; Accumulative lens held rigorously through dripping patterns to final ripple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viaduct constrains choice at every turn: salt scars hang bells, stone joints frame observations, damp-cloth sea sound dictates rhythm. "Breathing through damp cloth" isn't description—it pressures Efan's tactics and charges the final "silver ripple" image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Efan's agency: threads guide drops, reed metronome measures hum. Dominant stake (cosmic imbalance) tightens through drip-gull correlations, paying visible cost in "only rebuilt an echo" that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "brittle devotion" made tangible via seaweed threads and chalked sleeves. Ending's "learn hunger differently" reweights premise without moralizing, using the bell's "cracked lip" as resonant answer to cosmic imbalance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "drips fell as single syllables," "sea breathing through damp cloth." Rhythmic control under pressure ("counted, then counted again") with no register drift. Lyric compression taught early via dripping patterns pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "modest as a memory that decides to stay" exemplifies high-density lyricism. Minor deduction for "relieved mathematics answered with mercy" bordering abstraction at climax, but redeemed by concrete "flint dust" immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "mage fixes broken thing" trope through mathematical devotion. "Lukewarm" specificity avoids heroics; every detail (constellation names as "pebbles from gears") synthesizes into fresh cosmic calculus that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
