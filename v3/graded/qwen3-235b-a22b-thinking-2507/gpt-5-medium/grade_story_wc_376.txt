<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Narrator's wilting near dishonesty manifests in embodied micro-choices (passing sprig ungilded), with contradictory impulses (candor practice vs. complicity) driving the refusal to gild lies. Final stance crystallizes through earned causality when gathering the city forces the vault opening, making the cost legible in "knees soften" and postmaster's trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "tin on his hands bright as guilt" and the city's gathered presence; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (condensate beading like punctuation) without causality breaks. Orientation anchors by line 5 ("gilded-leaf calligrapher"), avoiding disorientation penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zinc jars function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("mist that fed the lettuce and the tired"), constraining choices when the postal fragment fits the escutcheon. Recurring objects (citronella sprig, zinc plate) evolve causally with the plot, avoiding static description through tactile navigation ("pried it free," "hatch sighed").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through narrator's agency: refusing gilding forces societal confrontation, with visible cost in the postmaster's nod and greenhouses dimming. "Dry as parchment" days reweight the dominant truth-vs-stability conflict under Accumulative pressure, foreclosing the path of silent complicity with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Pluviary of Spoken Things" naming offers resonant non-literal answer to "where lost conversations go," reweighting prior material through concrete action (jars breathing) without moralizing. Theme emerges from particulars like "mildew on my tongue," avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity in "mercy here was always thirsty for consent."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "leaves drink the candid" and "condensate beaded like punctuation," with rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during vault discovery). Lyric compression ("shy rain") is taught early and paid off at closure, avoiding head-hopping while modulating voice through emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shy rain" image crystallizes cost with surgical precision in the vault scene. Opening ("frightened lung") and closing ("measured survival in truths") lines recharge motifs through concrete action, with information density maximizing propulsion ("spores and porters more than masked couriers").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truth-telling as ecological necessity (confessions feeding lettuce) transforms dystopian tropes through specific verifiable detail ("tin-stained fingers," "zinc-etched plate"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscurity, making the emotional truth of "candor in small moments" feel inevitable.</comment>
