<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stubborn wish" vs. emotional vulnerability; micro-choices like seal-pressing earn closure through prior causality. Slight abstraction in "ran out of questions" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: mortar's "we are all full of rain" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Building itself constrains choice (seal must press to stone) and charges final image ("rooftop garden a cathedral"). Recurring rosemary planters evolve from setting to thematic anchor without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen coherently under Accumulative lens: "learn the language" evolves into bearing the building's truth. Cost crystallizes in "do not be cruel with truth" – visceral yet earned through weekly tea rituals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "agreed upon lies" transforms from lesson to mortar's confession. Final image reweights opening ("stairwell spoke") without moralizing – complex cost resonates in "we are all full of rain".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exceptional: "steam turns to rain on cold glass" embodies emotional thaw. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Are you dead, I said") avoids cadence loops while teaching its lyrical pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "kettle heat made hallway gentler, like an ellipsis" compresses time/emotion/setting in one propulsive line. Final image recharges opening without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: architectural personification as linguistic metaphor ("Latin in the cornice"). Risk-taking (truth via listening, not action) heightens stakes while mortar's confession feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
