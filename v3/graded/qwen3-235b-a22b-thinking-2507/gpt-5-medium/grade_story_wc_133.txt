<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in prying the gnat free ("pried the resin until the smallest history lifted")—a visceral micro-choice with felt cost. No stock phrasing; "wryly earnest" manifests concretely in barnacle apologies and the keeper's silent weep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the pact pinned by salt and mother's vanishing reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (released gnat, keeper's silent grief). Orientation anchors by word 10 ("tidal island woke"), and accumulative lens holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tidal island actively constrains choices—rain trails guide discovery, strata become the "lopsided chapel" for the pact. Final line’s "rain trails carried our pact across the island" charges closure through micro-setting, making environment indispensable to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally: brooch discovery forces keeper’s vulnerability ("looked as if a bell had rung"), escalating to the gnat’s release as irreversible cost. Pressure coheres through sensory density ("heat moved through us the way tides reason") under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: "color is a treaty" and final "meaning threshed itself... and did not scatter" avoid moralizing. Rain trails carrying the pact reweights "threshing" from labor to legacy without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "prayer tasted like rust," "tides like knives newly honest." Rhythm modulates from painter’s lean ("wind’s teeth") to sparse pact scene ("We did not pray; we made a pact"), with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances texture ("luminous as nerve pathways" integrates metaphor with function). Gnat release scene avoids overwriting—"spun once, a speck signing away its sentence"—with propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms water-war trope through painter’s lens ("paint became only clean water"). Risk-taking (mother as island’s shape) heightens stakes organically; no gimmickry in "kelp and memory" encounter.</comment>
