<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (painting despite doubt, tagging gold dots) but "not a miracle, she insisted" edges toward thematic assertion in a peak beat, slightly diluting earned emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: neighbor's map validates years of silent effort, foreclosing Lina's doubt with visible emotional weight ("measured gratitude") under Accumulative lens; anchors clear by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse functions as active micro-setting: constrains night painting, houses offerings, and charges final image as "small republic where kindness translated every border," fully meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) escalates through accumulation of painted faces and offerings; neighbor's return delivers felt cost (years of uncertainty) and reconfiguration under Accumulative lens, though escalation could tighten slightly earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (gold dots, rescued moth) not abstraction; final image of strangers "remembering themselves to another" resonates as non-literal answer to central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("saffron quiet," syllables "falling like beads") with rhythmic control, though "not a miracle, she insisted" momentarily shifts to expository interiority, risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("brush drank moonlight as if it remembered the mouth of a river") with propulsion. Final line recharges opening motif perfectly; only microscopic abstraction in "methodically hopeful" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "kindness pays forward" trope via specific, grounded choices (moon-tipped brush, lost languages market); emotional truth in "measured gratitude" avoids sentimentality while risking lyric density.</comment>
