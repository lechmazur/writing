<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in micro-choices: teaching compliance postures while cultivating unflaggable silence. Embodied grief in brittle bouquet handling; no therapy-speak during inspector confrontation. Final choice to declare lightness earns cost through "familiar vacancy" foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "whittle in evenings" pivot. Closure as Charged Poise: "Behold... lightness" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("vacancy where victory should sit" paid in full). Turbines' rhythm loss during silent sink lesson tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Turbines actively constrain choices (cover for silent gestures) and charge closure ("wind kept working, but inside, something finally did not"). Peach-wood flute's pith as "wound" reweights grief. Micro-setting mastery: brittle bouquet petals become "clipped syllables" that directly alter tactics during inspector scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: narrating laundry as "saga" with bouquet transforms compliance into resistance. Cost crystallizes when "familiar vacancy" follows inspector's departure, directly shaping the microphone-off sink lesson where silence becomes tactical. Single deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brittle bouquet's evolving use (funeral→inspector prop→child's lesson), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("something finally did not") reweights "happiness mandate" with conceptual cost without stating morals. No thematic echo; "lightness" insight earned via petal-thumbing moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "clock hands that forgot their point" and "pith bright as a wound." Rhythmic control under pressure: semicolon cadences compress tension during inspector scene. Zero register drift when declaring "hero wrung by circumstance" – clinical diction embodies performance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "petals fall like clipped syllables" achieves triple duty (image/sound/tactile). Peak-beat clarity: "we narrated with our hands only" avoids figurative muddle. Final line's negation ("something finally did not") delivers propulsion without overwriting. Only possible deduction: "bright as a wound" slightly risks register clash, but justified by whittling context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific grief mechanics: "remade hush" as unflaggable resistance tactic feels inevitable. Emotional truth in teaching children "angles of light that read as joy." Avoids safety middle via morally ambiguous complicity ("parents need the tokens"). Fresh inflection: happiness as "ballast disguised as song."</comment>
