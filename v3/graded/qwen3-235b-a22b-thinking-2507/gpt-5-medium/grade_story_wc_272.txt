<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (despair vs. hope) manifest in tangible micro-choices like mapping shelves with threads; final ledger entry earns transformation with visible cost. Avoids diagnostic labels entirely—"hands into moths" embodies emotion through profession-specific detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when "walls did not close in; they widened," reconfiguring fragmentation into connection with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each threaded card intensifies pressure toward the flame's "stubborn, then fluent" ignition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse actively constrains choices: sweating brine stones force descent, gearhouse rust dictates wick solution. The tarot cards-as-windows charge the final image ("stitched her to the weather"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement through micro-setting causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: "walls closing in" tightens pressure, her descent decision ("correction, not punishment") shows agency. Cost is visceral in the perished wick—a "dark tongue gnawed by salt"—reweighting her fragmented reality through tangible action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: keeper's "untangling threads" principle becomes embodied truth in wick braiding. Final image ("column of brightness stitching her to weather") reweights fragmentation without moralizing—earned through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gulls rode wind like commas") reflects artist's gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure: match-lighting sequence ("first stubborn, then fluent") compresses stress without voice drift. Lyric compression taught early with "tide-wrack" and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "luminescent ache after a bruise" avoids therapy-speak through embodied specificity. Only hairline slip—"relentless gale" slightly generic—but redeemed by "window trying not to rattle," maintaining propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse tropes via tarot-threading mechanic: needle holes aren't decorative but solve the wick problem. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation as plot engine) heightens stakes coherently—the keeper's redesign principle becomes Mara's salvation.</comment>
