<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "grief has seasonality, and the season is always now" grounds motivation; embodied emotion in "breath threaded with salt and brass" avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction for late tell-y "geography of healing" exposition weakening prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: thread's hum becomes "pilgrim trail under the roof" with visible cost in transformed weeping ("not a breaking but an irrigating"). Orientation solid by line 3; Accumulative lens holds with quince drops charging final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quince trees "bruise themselves fragrant" constrain choice via thread measurements; final "stubborn brilliance of leaving things" recharges harbor metaphor. Micro-setting (fountain stone lip) shapes intimate geometry that enables breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through thread ritual: "he is in all of them and in none" deepens into "space beside teacup is not an ache." Cost legible in shoulders learning "slope a future can rest on"—agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "explained absences" becoming "breathing space," not stated morals. Final image reweights harbor metaphor with conceptual cost: "latitude changes nothing around me" transforms into "small inland sea awaiting tide."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "leaves like small coins spending their shine"; rhythmic control shifts from "lonesome splendor" to "copper and kelp" under pressure. No head-hopping; elision (ships' departure) taught early and paid in thread's hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "raw from hauling hope on a rope that keeps breaking" risks mixed metaphor. Zero loops; final line "stubborn brilliance" crystallizes with textural specificity. Hairline slip doesn't touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obituaries for the living via textile logic (thread as "measuring line" becoming "pilgrim trail"). Transforms grief tropes through "geography of healing" specificity—avoids safety middle with "crooked key" metaphor.</comment>
