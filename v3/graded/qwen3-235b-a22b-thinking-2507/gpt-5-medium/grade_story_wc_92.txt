<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "calmly inventive" sentinel balancing duty and revolution; Fara's thinness and Rhun's abrupt shift undermine secondary pressure despite strong embodied choices with the quill holder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "guarding consent instead of fear" crystallizes the revolution's cost through town's shadow discovery; Rhun's unearned conversion slightly weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder charges the final image ("rests warm in my palm"), but the "cradle of sparks" workshop lacks concrete constraints on choices despite vivid soot/wire imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Blackout pressure tightens meaningfully toward dimming the fort, but Rhun's conversion lacks felt cost—his nod feels like a soft reset rather than earned trade-off under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "winking hush" reprise in the final line reframes revolution as consent, avoiding moralizing while charging closure with conceptual cost of relearning night.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in light/shadow lexicon ("lamps go missing," "hearthglow") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "coals dream under ash" slightly disrupts pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats but "wires rest like snakes learning to be lines" creates mixed metaphor muddle; otherwise, high density and cadence shifts ("dim it, and make room for eyes") propel closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution-as-dimming avoids tropes through specific "patient angles" and hearthglow; "silent revolution" premise risks familiarity but earns distinction via embodied stakes in twilight fort.</comment>
