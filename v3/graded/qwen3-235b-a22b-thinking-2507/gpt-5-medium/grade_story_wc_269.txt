<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via tapping habit and atlas rewriting; motivation ("discover why paths disappear") drives concrete choices. Slight lack of contradictory impulses under pressure holds back 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("lanterns set to tumble") under Accumulative lens. "Delayed revelation" phrasing risks abstraction but plankton corridor crystallizes stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Monitoring station functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tapping on console, "Assemble" key). Final image of lanterns "gatehinged to the sea" charges closure through tool evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through knowledge accumulation (paths as "living geometry"), but escalation lacks visceral narrowing of options. Cost legible in temporary markers accepting impermanence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lanterns... reset each night" reconfiguring "nothing assembled stays assembled." Avoids moralizing; final rewrite of atlas embodies earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via rhythm-tapping ("tap tap pause tap") and coral-witness lexicon. "Periodically eternal" slightly abstract but compensated by concrete payoff in corridor discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences vary rhythmically ("plankton like hinges in the dark"). Figurative language serves clarity, though "permutations of the tide" risks vagueness near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tapping as data archive transforms climate grief into communal ritual. Corridor as "moored migration" feels inevitable through specific, verifiable detail (lunar peaks, spawning nights).</comment>
