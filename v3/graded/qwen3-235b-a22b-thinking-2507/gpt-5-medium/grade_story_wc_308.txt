<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("weathered resolve" vs. passive waiting) and embodied emotion ("burr of use," "thumbs to arrowhead") deepen character, but final insight lacks visible struggle; micro-choices like tying arrowhead show hierarchy of values without sufficient prior tension to make endurance feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise ("I hold still, and I travel as the birds travel") with conceptual cost (pulse "less alone for having been heard"), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—Accumulative/Textural drive isn't clearly anchored until "I breathe into the cord" (~200 words), risking orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: "towers of bone" function as tuning forks shaping navigation, while "black mirror" and arrowhead directly charge the climax; "lichen scent" reweights time as spiral, making environment indispensable to closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through density (bird patterns → pulse detection), but protagonist agency is passive—escalation driven by environment (winds, birds), not character choice; cost ("empty cord") is legible but not actively wrested, violating "agency must drive escalation" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("time is a spiral winding around bone"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "navigate without moving" via birds' "agreement," but "less alone for having been heard" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("feathers ticked with dust like soot") and rhythmic control shine, but elevated diction ("dish of light") occasionally clashes with stone-skimmer lexicon under pressure; no head-hopping, though reflection on knappers risks over-explanation without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "a dish of light" creates mixed metaphor (dish implies containment vs. arcing flight), and "vessel/resin" simile stalls momentum; minor artifacts pre-climax trigger -0.4 penalty, disallowing 9+ despite exceptional density elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes "spiritual journey" trope with unique sonic mechanics; risk-taking (passive protagonist, lyric structure) heightens coherence, but "canyon of endless echoes" borders on cliché—rescued by specific "shale pools" and harmonic physics that make the fresh angle inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
