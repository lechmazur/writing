<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic but lacks embodied struggle; the apology to the dream feels unearned without visible prior resistance. Contradictory impulses ("hunger would eat the music" vs. "tenderness") remain abstract rather than driving concrete micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with legible cost ("glacial hush turn from marble to water under his ribs"), but the finch moment lacks causal escalation—it crystallizes rather than deepens pressure. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet the stance shift feels abrupt without prior tactical narrowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sanctuary and forecourt constrain choices (e.g., barefoot contact with crystal seams carrying apology), charging the final image. However, "glacial hush" functions more as theme than active constraint; environment shapes tactics but doesn't alter a key decision point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with abandoned dream) tightens via the finch’s "conductor" posture, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—the realization emerges passively from observation. Cost is felt ("marble to water under ribs") yet remains conceptually diffuse rather than viscerally legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("keep meeting it... until both of you are home") reweights the dream as "weather" with resonant ambiguity, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete particulars (crystal seams, sleeping clocks) rather than abstraction, earning its emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petrichor nostalgia hung like an old shawl") persists under pressure, but "origami thunder" strains lexicon. Rhythmic control shines in closure ("both weathers would count as music"), though reflection fragments risk overwriting without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but paraphrase loops ("excruciatingly gentle" repeated verbatim) and mixed metaphor ("origami thunder") dilute momentum. Final line’s propulsion offsets earlier density issues, yet the "tide before surge" simile borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned dream" trope through clockmaker specificity and "crystal whispering forecourt," but "city of bells" risks familiar archetype. Emotional truth in "shame a mask for tenderness" elevates, though "glacial hush" concept lacks fresh inflection beyond established lyricism.</comment>
