<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "polishing rails that flickered between metals, greeting ghosts and salaries with the same grin," but the radio voice's exposition about merging timelines lacks sufficient prior causality for the final choice's motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the steady ferry and hourglass shining with "ash colored like dawn" reconfigure transience with undeniable cost, though the radio voice's sudden "older self" explanation risks conceptual leap without earlier groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The spectral grotto's dripping letters and starlight dust actively constrain choices (aligning lattice with stars), while the hourglass evolves from discarded object to closure-charging symbol, perfectly embodying micro-setting rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the grotto sequence as lattice alignment forces a trade-off between permanence options, but escalation leans slightly on the radio voice's exposition rather than pure protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Promises mean little without their undertow" emerges organically from the grotto's star-mirrors, avoiding moralizing; the final image of "footprints agreeing to stay" reweights the vanishing ferry with devastating resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—"bulkheads hum like a beehive of calendars," "frost in the shape of timetables"—with rhythm shifting from lyrical to urgent without a single cadence misstep or POV slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion: "dew from benches nobody properly sat" exemplifies concrete density, though "renegotiating days" slightly abstracts amid otherwise tactile imagery in the bulkhead hum sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms quantum tropes through deckhand labor (broom bristles tracing wakes), with the grotto's ceiling dripping letters feeling inevitable yet fresh; avoids derivative safety via "permanent transient" specificity.</comment>
