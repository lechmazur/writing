<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("crown hunger" vs. "ache of libraries") and embodied micro-choices (palette knife on paint layers) earn the renunciation; Quin's doubt manifests concretely in hand placement at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "Quin, uncertain but brave" and "unrealized futures turning into seeds" reweight sovereignty through stewardship, holding Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard's "stored summer" air and peeling pump house wall actively constrain choices (ruby flake splitting waterfall, revealing stair seam); final "apples exhale messages" charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Pressure tightens via sunrise deadline and throne's silence threat, but visible mid-story cost (e.g., physical toll) is underdeveloped; stakes remain viscerally felt through "pinged softly like metronomes" urging caution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "choices deferred with care" murals and stewardship compromise; "unrealized futures turning into seeds" reweights sovereignty without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "lenses fogged with old rain" and "paint brittle as leaves in an archived autumn"; tense/stability holds through descent, though "coronation circlet" backstory slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" avoids synonym churn; minor density risk in "colors unused for lifetimes breathed in thin sighs" saved by rhythmic payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Ascent inverts" reconfiguration feels inevitable through orchard/stair logic; "governance as duet" synthesizes trope into fresh emotional calculus without safety-hedging.</comment>
