<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archivist's embodied contradiction ("calm not to hide tremble") and micro-choices under pressure elevate beyond stock healer; townspeople lack sufficient internal conflict to fully earn the collective shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "trembling only at places we have not named" and the town's "less fractured chest"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lavender field actively constrains choices (bees approving photo placement, diesel-perfumed corridor) and charges the final image; ruins transform from "monsters" to walkable terrain through embodied action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the ritual's deepening (circle tightening, walking corridor twice) with visible cost in unresolved grief; archivist's agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("transmute pain into a masterpiece" via walked corridor), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights grief as "less fractured chest" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight") and rhythmic control under pressure; slight register drift in "relief often sounds like a bell" during high-stakes reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("bees stitched yellow punctuation"), though "trembling only at places we have not named" edges toward abstraction; final line "memorize with your feet" crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work with communal healing; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes through the mirror's charged payoff without gimmickry.</comment>
