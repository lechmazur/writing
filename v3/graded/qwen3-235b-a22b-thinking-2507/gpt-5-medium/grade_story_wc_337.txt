<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "taught the faces to hold stillness" versus "almost fell," with embodied cost in the near-fall. Caretaker lacks depth as secondary pressure, slightly weakening the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "hush changed weight" reconfigures spirits from panic to "choosing to stay." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but net-unraveling repetition slightly dilutes escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choices: starlight refracts to seal mask cracks, charging the final image. Needle and masks function as micro-setting, directly shaping tactics and closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through unraveling knots—each releases memory requiring "weighing with stones," with visible cost in the near-fall. Protagonist agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens, no coincidence resolves tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "braided [joy] with grief" avoids moralizing. Final image ("tide accepted the shape of the shore") reweights acceptance versus erasure with undeniable conceptual cost, no stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whalebone polished smooth by palms long gone to silt") modulates rhythm under pressure. Slight register drift in "interlaced hush" but elision taught early pays off in closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in "horror rose, we gave it breath enough to sigh"—abstract personification risks sentimentality. No loops, but one borderline overwritten phrase dulls closure’s immediacy slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms spirit-work trope via concrete details: "weighed them with stones," "locket of hair white with salt." Risk-taking (needle accumulating silence) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
