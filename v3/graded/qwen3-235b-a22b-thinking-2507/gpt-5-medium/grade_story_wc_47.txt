<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I kept what was mine... let go of what was yours," with embodied cost in the pendant's warmth and chain-laced fingers. Minor abstraction in "small animal that will bite" slightly dilutes peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: counting drips crystallizes fragile reconnection with conceptual cost in the exposed chain. Accumulative lens holds throughout, pressure building via sensory density toward the final image's undeniable reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The moss garden actively constrains movement and meaning—the pendant burial in silicon-tasting loam charges the final image. "Phone room after summer storm" smell transforms setting from backdrop to character, with icicle patterns dictating their path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("I am not an arena") and tighten under Accumulative pressure: the honeyed hush literally "sweetens edges of words that would otherwise cut," altering their interaction. Cost is undeniable in the buried pendant and exposed chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—burying the pendant as "graft[ing] a story to the wound"—with the chain's "umbilical of light" offering resonant, non-literal hope. Zero moralizing; cost in "not forgiveness, exactly" avoids false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: noticing "pale dots" from drips and "moss gossiping" filters all description. Dialogue subtext ("You kept it") reveals history without exposition, with syntax compressing under stress ("We do not hug; we inventory").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "joints cracking like tiny switches" avoids cliché while advancing character. Final line "practice being two again" crystallizes theme without overwriting. "Fossil of sunlight" risks slight overstatement but is redeemed by burial context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation trope through hyper-specific setting (data center moss garden) and fresh metaphors ("constellation laid in silt"). Emotional truth in "clutching her own elbows" avoids generic templates, with icicle patterns creating organic inevitability.</comment>
