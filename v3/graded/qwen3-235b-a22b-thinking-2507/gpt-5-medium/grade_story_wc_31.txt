<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not superstitious... hides behind truth") lacks dramatized cost; embodied emotion strong but final vow feels unearned by prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visible cost ("wet with a vow and a color"); Accumulative lens holds through luminous vows' density shift to silver hum; cost legible in "light the pier without tiring of attention".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor floor constrains choice (swimming into ship); recurring key tag charges final image; micro-setting (tinderbox, mask) integrates with action but sunken ship lacks tactile pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering sound's color) tightens through library's hum; agency in vow-writing forecloses borrowing silver; cost ("wet with a vow") visible but stakes lack visceral escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights sound as "colorable weather" without moralizing; theme emerges from luminous vows' evolution to "thawing silver"; avoids sentimentality through concrete library mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("nacre light... shell keeps after listening to tides"); rhythmic control under pressure with taught elision ("where my hands hovered"); no head-hopping in single-POV dive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "pearly vibration tarnished... like moonlight nicked by old knives" has mixed metaphor in closure beat, blocking 9+ per Text Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound/color through sailor vows; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes; specific library mechanics ("furred with salt") avoid generic lyricism.</comment>
