<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives the pen ritual; embodied shame ("tastes like rusted tools") and micro-choice of writing furrows earn the closure's forgiveness with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: manifest "dated months ago" crystallizes history editing under Accumulative lens, reweighting "bad seeds" through the shimmering stalk's contingent ripple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gravity anomaly constrains every choice (warping tea/conversations), while Del's pen charges the final image; station's groan during writing makes environment a tactical pressure point for the timeline's emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: pressing pen to wrist and "unbending" lines alters the broadcast's path, with cost legible in "clocks forgot which wrist they loved" as history shifts under contingent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: "editing history" via linked bowls of water reframes farming failure as cosmic reciprocity; final seed shipment answers "bad seeds" without moralizing, charging the Quiet with earned hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gravity pooled and thinned in tides, warping clocks, tea") modulates under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in the timeline's "oat awns" reconfiguration without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels: "Words arrived like migrants, slow and careful, carrying kitchens" achieves triple density without muddle, while final "blanket that remembers several winters" avoids sentimentality through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "editing history" trope via gravitational contingency and farming guilt; "linked bowls of water" metaphor feels inevitable yet fresh, risking lyric density that heightens stakes without obscuring closure's causal logic.</comment>
