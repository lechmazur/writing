<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("pretend stars are maps forward" vs. "hush dissonance") drives the Earned Stasis closure. Diagnostic phrasing "guilt lives in waveforms" triggers -0.4 deduction despite otherwise embodied emotion in the self-tattoo climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: self-tattooing the glyph "crossing my pulse like a bridge" reconfigures guilt with visible cost (the inked line). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the recorder’s escalating translations ("sleep me" → "stay" → "thank you") tighten pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting objects constrain choice: amber held to recorder shifts the cry’s key, cabinet becomes payment. Final image ("insect seemed to flex, as if choosing") charges closure through the tool’s irreplaceable specificity, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: protagonist chooses to ink the glyph after recorder translates "I am untethered," narrowing options to self-confrontation. Cost is unmistakable in the self-tattoo crossing the pulse—a physical manifestation of emotional reckoning under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber’s "choice" motif, culminating in the insect’s implied decision to "stay." Final line ("the sound thins") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to guilt without moralizing—no thematic echo, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "stars quiet as meteor hush" and "dust paused midair like a constellation." Under pressure, syntax compresses effectively ("I could not breathe") while maintaining rhythmic control. Lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "wings forever almost" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor template cadence in backstory section ("There was a scream... Now I translate...") prevents 9+ but avoids loop penalties. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms guilt trope via haunted firmware and amber’s "choice" motif. The recorder translating cries into "I am untethered" feels inevitable yet fresh—synthesis of emotional specificity and conceptual risk (ghosted frequencies) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
