<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "incandescent restraint" vs. emotional need to soothe grief. Micro-choices like pressing pages against ice embody "texture is not touch alone." Final endurance earns cost through "lamp's hum weakens," avoiding tidy resolution. Slight thematic echo in "workable grammar" nearly slips into label-speak but stays anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "patience answers patience" crystallizes the ritual's fragility with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—freezing basin breaks the halo into "windows in stalled time," deepening pressure without causal turns. Orientation clear by 40 words; no causality breaks. Minor deduction for near-thematic echo in "workable grammar" line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stone basin constrains choices and charges closure: refracting light enables story creation, freezing forces adaptation ("gilding its edge with cold"). Sensory details serve pressure—"wind knocks at shutters with patient knuckles" embodies waiting. Micro-setting functions as environment; no generic placeholders. Full integration elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence vs. paper) tightens through Accumulative lens: basin freezing reweights options by breaking the halo. Protagonist agency drives escalation—measuring hum, refracting light—culminating in visible cost ("lamp's hum weakens"). "Invented histories bear weight" crystallizes stance with conceptual price. No coincidence; pressure coheres relentlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "peppery radishes" and "impossible train" reweight "invented histories" as non-false if they "let a hand rest." Final image ("patience answers patience") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—insights arise from "bonsai needles twitch[ing]" not abstraction. Emotional honesty in "grief hesitates" lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: stationer notices "gold edges," "faint hum," "bruise" of time. Syntax mirrors precision ("Numbers are a courtesy to uncertainty"). Under pressure, diction stays character-specific ("gilding its edge with cold"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from studious to tender. Rhythmic control peaks in frozen-basin beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture. "Lamps hanging like sleeping fruit" shows textural specificity without muddle. Final line recharges opening ritual with "steady hand." Minor deduction: "sly modulation" slightly elevates diction but fits stationer's lexicon. Propulsion flawless—"wind crawls through alleys" breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via specific synthesis: bonsai as "living archive," stories folded "like invoices." Emotional truth in "tucked [envelopes] under bread like savings." Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—"impossible train" feels inevitable. Avoids safety middle; "grief hesitates" rejects false binaries. Freshness through verifiable detail, not quirks.</comment>
