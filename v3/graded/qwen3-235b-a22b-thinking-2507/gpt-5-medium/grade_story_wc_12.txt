<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details like "eyes a longitude no map would claim" and the "dry laugh" carrying contradictory forgiveness. Micro-choices (husband's palm placement, Mara's lip movement) reveal value hierarchies under pressure. Slight underdevelopment of Mara's internal contradiction pre-possession prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "Mara chose her own name again" crystallizes the renunciation of the whisper's bargain, visibly steadying the room. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the rhetorical devices build density until the ultramarine lake becomes the decisive constraint. The "exhale multiplied" image charges the final cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The palette functions as micro-setting, constraining choices when the whisper "slipped toward" it and charging the final image with "Mara touched the palette." Sensory hierarchy excels: crisis narrows perception to the loop pedal's "frost" absence and ultramarine's "tiny bruise" wink, avoiding checklist clichés. Final line’s "night relented" mirrors internal resolution through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the husband’s palm placement shifts tactics, stacking breaths into a "visible ladder" under the loop pedal’s pressure. The possession’s near-completion raises cost visibly ("flexed, testing for anchors"), and Mara’s choice forecloses the deal with felt consequence. Agency remains Ilario’s until the critical moment where Mara reclaims her name—elegant escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the "child's pocket key" parable reweights "jewelry" as avoidance, crystallizing in Mara’s laugh that "forgave nobody and everyone." No moralizing—only the final image of the palette "keep[ing] watch" offering non-literal resolution. Avoids false balance; the whisper’s bargain is framed as theft, not compromise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Ilario notices "unraveled stillness" and "decorates with silence," while Mara’s POV is filtered through physical rupture ("shield crack"). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—"Mara, Mara, Mara" anaphora building to the ultramarine’s "dark" current. No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks to breath-level during the ladder scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "muffled clarity" metaphor evolves from "frost" absence to "honesty" without muddle. Sentences vary rhythmically: short ("He pressed stop") against lyrical cadences ("a longitude no map would claim"). "Winked like a tiny bruise" risks mixed metaphor but gains cohesion through ultramarine’s consistent "listening" agency. Final line’s "night relented" resolves with textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism tropes through the loop pedal’s "absence of sound" and rhetoric-as-tool. The dimensional anchor isn’t backdrop but active constraint—the neighborhood’s tilt depends on Ilario’s timing. Risk-taking (ultramarine as sentient lake) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the "dry laugh" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh. Avoids safety-middle by making the husband’s denial credible.</comment>
