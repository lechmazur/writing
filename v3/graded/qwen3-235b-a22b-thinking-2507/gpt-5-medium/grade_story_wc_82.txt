<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied grief (polishing stones like "confession," ache as physical weight) and contradictory impulses (chasing shadow while accepting its departure). Minor deduction for childhood memory flashback slightly telling rather than showing present choice friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: shadow's touch "loosens" the ache with visceral cost ("no longer drags at the world around his ankles"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation culminating in final image. Orientation clear by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass basilica actively constrains choices (prisms seed lungs with color, irised panes tune sun for lens work) and charges final image (ribbon names whispered during lens cleaning). Micro-setting of gem polishing tools could deepen tactical constraints slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief vs acceptance) tightens when abbess declares "paper would be too heavy," forcing vapor crane adaptation. Cost legible in hoarse laughter and lifted ache. Single escalation sufficient for length, though shadow's return slightly eases tension before resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: steam cranes "taught to float without drowning" reweight grief as buoyant memory. Final image (whispering ribbon names) answers central question without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystalline ("sky like a spoon catches sugar," stones "chime like small bells"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (compressed syntax during polishing). Abbess's dialogue slightly archetypal but redeemed by contextual purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; sentences multi-task ("wind moves tea shrubs in rows like sleeping lungs" establishes setting/mirrors breath/implied grief). Minor deduction for "faithful as thunder" cliché, though contextually justified. Final line specificity prevents sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through glass/shadow physics ("shadow unlatching like a door," ache as physical drag). Risk-taking in making absence tangible elevates beyond metaphor. No derivative echoes; floating island feels newly imagined as "airy cathedral."</comment>
