<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "practicing absence until departure felt ordinary," but emotional progression lacks visible struggle; the "weight of tiny vows" moment edges toward label-only intensity without sufficient prior degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "we give them our pauses" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of tiny vows"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds cohesively from the orris shard’s first use to the final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orris shard (tool) constrains every choice and charges the closure—its warming/cooling directly reveals house aliveness, making the final "breath" image resonate with tangible cost; sensory specificity avoids cliché ("damp rope and dill," "tide’s small applause").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening perception (cold shard → warm shard → bright shard) narrows the narrator’s understanding under Accumulative lens, but the "hushed blaze" timeframe lacks tactical pressure; cost is felt ("weight of tiny vows") yet time’s role in urgency remains atmospheric, not operational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through displaced objects (spoon, beetle tin) culminating in the resonant, non-literal closure: houses live on "inadvertent ritual of attention," avoiding moralizing while charging prior details with conceptual cost—no thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer") and rhythmic control ("tide pulled by a small moon") persist under pressure; elision (woman’s backstory) taught early pays off in the second house’s resistance, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("kettle’s whistle grows fainter" does triple duty) but "inadvertently profound" slightly strains in the spoon scene, risking overwriting without full payoff in that beat’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted house" trope through the displaced-objects method, making emotional truth hinge on mundane details (broom under chair); the beetle tin payoff feels earned and specific, resisting abstraction while heightening stakes via tangible "weight."</comment>
