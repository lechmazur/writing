<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("brave and foolish") and embodied emotion ("roots in my ankles") are strong, but the scar-woman lacks depth; her motivation ("to find the intersection of dreams") feels abstract without sufficient friction against the protagonist's flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds through "hedges growing words" to Charged Poise closure where "the border of waking and dreaming blurred" reconfigures stakes with visible cost in "the blue hour would not be unmade."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cobalt glade actively constrains choices—hedges become doors demanding answers, the pool reflects promises—culminating in the maze reconfiguration that charges the final image; environment is indispensable, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (eclipsed covenant vs. new vow) deepen through lyric accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; the woman's arrival feels coincidental, softening the pressure shift toward the "braided" resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the maze becoming "a grammar" reweights the covenant without moralizing, and the final blurred border offers a resonant answer to "intersection of dreams" through image, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaf-veins lit with residual lightning") and rhythmic control shine, but "burns in the shape of hours" risks overwriting; voice modulates effectively from "anxious elation" to steadied resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("path unfurled under our joined pain like a ribbon pulled from a mouth"), though "blistered by possibilities" leans abstract; minor scaffold in "I did not argue; the anxious elation..." slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of covenant/maze tropes via "braided vow" and scar-linking mechanics feels inevitable, but the gardeners' sudden appearance lacks groundwork, slightly undermining risk-taking coherence.</comment>
