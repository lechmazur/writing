<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory precision ("salted the bell lips with powdered ice"), but Keepers' transformation lacks prior micro-choices to ground their shift; muteness enables action yet secondary pressure feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "trembled, not from doubt, but from the restrained force of guarding delight" crystallizes cost of preserving wonder; Accumulative lens holds with density shift during symphony ("transparent harmonies").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bluff's weather (ledger's "tiny marks") and iceberg fragment constrain choices; "powdered ice" alters attack to charge final image, though cloud motifs verge on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake crystallizes through Iri's agency (angling shard), narrowing options to "preserve wonder" vs. archival fear; cost is palpable in trembling fingers, but Keepers' pressure lacks early causal buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Preserve the color of wonder" emerges through iceberg's glisten and Keepers' tears, avoiding moralizing; slight tell in "Iri believed sound... could preserve" weakens earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frostbitten birds cupped in their chests") with rhythmic control; lyric compression taught early ("world lay below like furled clouds") pays off in closure's "water tunes stone".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "frostbitten birds fluttering but alive" risks mixed vehicle; figurative muddle in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell-tuning as truth-telling avoids trope; risk-taking (mute protagonist, kinetic sculptures) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
