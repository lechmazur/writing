<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Synesthesia deeply embodied ("hearing blue as a hush"), but motivation remains abstract despite "doubt" moment; sculptor functions as prop without status dynamics or shared value hierarchy during collaboration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when "streets learned a softer geometry," making conceptual cost undeniable; aurora-to-golden-curtain progression teaches Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint with coherent pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern constrains every choice (bell on blue ice column, frost-flowers from chisel heat), while "oscillating repose" movement motif charges the final image of "tuning fork" spines; sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certifying wonder) tightens through single deepening ("remembering the city where noise was currency"), but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; lacks tangible price altering tactics despite strong lens alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sculpted hush" as physical vessel, but final line "a standard by which noise could be measured" states thesis directly, violating organic emergence rule with -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted cedar, salt, mint, bruised peach" for aurora) with rhythmic control under pressure; synesthesia refracts all description without head-hopping, though sculptor's interiority remains opaque.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero scaffold/loops; minor density risk in "amber sheet" description ("pressed with staves like veins and notes that blinked like tiny trapped suns") avoided by payoff in hush manifestation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and sculptural silence avoids trope pitfalls; "certifying wonder as essential" transforms market metaphor into tangible stakes, though city contrast lacks specific verifiable detail for maximum impact.</comment>
