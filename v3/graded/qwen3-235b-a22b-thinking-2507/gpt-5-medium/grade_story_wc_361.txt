<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (jittery vs stillness need) embodied in "neck prickling" during corridor thinning; micro-choices like hand-cupping reveal hierarchy of values (duty over grief) with felt cost as widow departs "smaller and then gone".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "miracles should not be kept past their flavor" crystallizes the stakes, with the corridor's necessary thinning making the before/after legible through the widow's irreversible descent into snow-globe solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ridgeway's hum and aurora actively constrain choices (vibrating sympathetically requires ridge attunement), charging the final image where it "throbs faintly underfoot" as a "great heart" – environment shapes both tactics and closure's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: density intensifies as pendant trembles "like a moth trapped inside a bell," culminating in the corridor's birth with visible cost – the widow's physical shrinking and the courier's solitary vigil where "the ridge offers only its old green hush".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through action: "planting continuance in the clefts of ordinary life" reweights the premise without moralizing, as the yew's germination into a temporal corridor becomes the non-literal answer to sustaining connection beyond grief's "chewed edges".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "ridgeway that hums like a tuning fork laid across the spine of the world" – the courier's synesthetic noticing (hearing aurora's color, feeling snow's memory) modulates rhythm under pressure with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line craft near-flawless; "laughter enters on the bell note, the exact timbre of thaw" avoids overwriting through precise sonic texture, though "smaller, stranger sounds of stones shifting" slightly strains coherence in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms courier trope through specific mechanics: "vibrating sympathetically" to extend encounters isn't gimmick but organic to the ridgeway's physics, with the "corridor" reconfiguration feeling inevitable from prior particulars of bone-tube warmth and sprig rattling.</comment>
