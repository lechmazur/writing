<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("frost beneath the ribs"), but Oko's characterization remains archetypal despite functional partnership; Mara's micro-choices (threading filament) earn her thawing, yet secondary pressure lacks depth beyond cavern's role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "numbness loosened, like frost admitting it was water" crystallizes cost of Mara's self-deception ("she had already stopped without noticing") under Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure tightens via drum's backward mechanics reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (sound-swallowing basalt enabling backward recording) and charges final image ("cavern bowed back with a breath she felt"); drumhead/needle repair is tactile, lived-in action where tools dictate possibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara's agency (rigging needle to drumhead) narrowing options from fear to action; cost legible in "she had already stopped without noticing," though Oko's role slightly dilutes protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "filament of hush" reconfigured from metaphor to tangible thread; ending avoids moralizing by showing numbness "admitting it was water," offering non-literal answer to emotional thawing via drum's reversed pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taught rhythm through skin, bones") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in "backward recorded songs unspool into glancing echoes" modulates intensity without head-hopping, though Oko's voice lacks full differentiation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thread drawn from silence itself" exemplifies high-density metaphor that clarifies rather than obscures; "frost admitting it was water" finale achieves crystalline propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ingenuity in synthesizing deafness with reversed sound mechanics feels inevitable; "listening backward to move forward" transforms trope through tactile specificity, though cavern setting borders on archetype without deeper cultural texture.</comment>
