<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between mapping faithfully versus "shirking with pretty symbols" crystallizes in hopscotch choice; embodied emotion via "shawl woven from echoes" avoids abstraction. No secondary character present, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("house rose slightly on its stilts of memory") reweights legacy with conceptual cost ("burden settle on my shoulders"). Accumulative lens holds: density peaks at hopscotch beat where floor "sighed open" with unsent letter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust squares constrain hopscotch actions that "reveal where grief pooled"; final image of house rising on "stilts of memory" charges closure through setting-as-character. Micro-setting (chalk grid) directly alters tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake ("legacy's burden") tightens when negative demands "map it faithfully or shirk," resolved through hopscotch agency. Cost legible in "shawl woven from echoes" charging the final rise of the house under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "calcified vow" and "unsent letter," avoiding moralizing; final image ("dreaming would continue without me") reweights legacy as communal inheritance without stating morals. "Charted a school for hearing" crystallizes non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("salt grammar of vanished tenants," "plaster symphony") persists under pressure; hopscotch sequence uses staccato rhythm matching action. No head-hopping; reflection stays anchored to soot-warmed negative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dust squares of hopscotch" reprise shifts meaning from play to revelation. Final line’s "plastic confetti skittered like faint laughter" avoids cliché while charging closure. No figurative muddle in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Corridor echo cartographer" transforms mapping trope through sensory-specific cartography; "stilts of memory" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (play as method) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
