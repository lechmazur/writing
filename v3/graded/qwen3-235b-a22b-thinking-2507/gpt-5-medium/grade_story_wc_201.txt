<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest physically ("displaced, but rooted the way a graft is rooted"); final renunciation of instrumentality ("ask to be wood again") earned through proprioceptive cost in torque metaphor. No therapy-speak despite trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: knotted mask strap creates "boundary marker" with visible cost (metal warming/photosynthesizing regret), reconfiguring ultraviolet penance as "calibration" under Accumulative lens. Forest dimming proves cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest actively constrains choices (paints shins with "cobalt fire," demands bodily honesty), charging final image where protagonist carries forest internally. Body-as-setting via proprioception shapes mercy calculus ("angles where pain changes flavor").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally: "mathematics of mercy" evolves from abstract quest to embodied theorem via forest equations. Cost crystallizes in "point at which a person must brace" as "infinite cost," directly shaping the boundary marker decision with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "Mercy begins where that wall first appears" reweights premise via bark-scrape physics. Final image ("carrying a forest inside me") answers mercy question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "mathematics" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: proprioception filters all description ("world spins like a compass dropped into hidden magnets"). Rhythm modulates under stress—fragmented during bracing, fluid in reflection—without voice slippage even with caretaker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt fire" and "torque like a drawn bow" achieve triple duty (image/emotion/stakes). Final paragraph’s "valley... screws... forest inside me" progression shows rhythmic propulsion. Only microscopic flaw: "private morse" likely intentional voice choice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms interrogation tropes through proprioceptive lens ("wove answers out of muscle flinch"); UV penance feels fresh via scar-glowing physics. Risk-taking ("mathematics of mercy") heightens stakes without gimmickry, culminating in bark-etched geometry.</comment>
