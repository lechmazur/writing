<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trade scars for stardust / cling to the fray" but "poet's soul igniting" veers into label-speak; embodied emotion falters at climax where "heart quickened with subtle passion" lacks concrete physicality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "rope fall, patterns unresolved" crystallizes the temporal dilemma with conceptual cost ("texture felt in heart's quiet roar"), but the Orientation Test penalty applies—prison escape backstory lacks spatial anchoring, muddying early causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto excels as micro-setting (constraining choices via etched patterns), though "energy beings' luminous forms" leans generic; final image's "frayed coil" on stone floor charges closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias' agency (tracing patterns, rejecting visions), but escalation relies on internal realization rather than external pressure shifts; cost is felt yet abstract in "mortal impermanence" versus tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the rope's transformation from escape tool to temporal anchor, but "ethically playful" dialogue risks thematic echo; final image reweights time's texture without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in sensory details ("dust-choked roadsides," "burlap in loss's clutch"), though "ethically playful" label intrudes; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure with lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero loops but "passionate subtlety" repetition and "soul igniting" create subtle scaffold; high density stumbles only in "conceptual or social cost" abstraction during peak tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of temporal physics and poetic craft ("texture of time" as tactile metaphor) transforms tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes without obscuring closure's quiet charge.</comment>
