<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in locksmith's tactile expertise ("fingers deft with keys," gear assortment humming) creates authentic motivation. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at climax; nostalgia for locking away sorrow remains untested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: stalled timepiece whirring to life syncs with her breath, transforming legacy into rhythm guardianship. Cost legible in "weight... transform" with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding through refracted light reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (frozen library pages, clockmaker's gears) constrains choice: ice-sealed volumes force parchment sifting, gears become literal keys. Final image charged by "driftwood relic made new" reweighting tactile history against cosmic repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when uncapping vial realigns mirrors, narrowing options to gear-fitting. Agency deficit: prophecy guides rather than drives choices. Cost undeniable in identity transformation ("no longer just a locksmith") but escalation lacks protagonist-initiated pressure shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—gears clicking with "nostalgic resonance," rhythm syncing to breath—not abstraction. Final image reweights "driftwood nostalgia" into active relic, answering "rhythm of repair" without moralizing. Avoids all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: locksmith's tactile POV filters all description ("frost-laced stairs," "brass cogs hummed"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn to urgent uncapping. "Hauntingly bright" phrasing borders on cliché in mirror description, slightly diluting precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "vial sealed with intricate filigree" integrates tool with tension. Paraphrase loop in second paragraph ("driftwood nostalgia... memories of her apprenticeship") triggers -0.3 deduction. Zero artifacts in peak uncapping beat preserves momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific mechanics: lunar-eclipse locksmith redefined by "rhythm" not magic, hall of mirrors as cosmic alignment puzzle. "Driftwood relic made new" synthesizes nostalgia with rebirth organically. Near-echo of "uncapped heart" metaphor prevents 9.0.</comment>
