<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("wistful," "stoically sparkling") rather than embodied contradiction; the sacrifice feels inevitable but lacks micro-choices showing struggle against unraveling the tapestry, making the renunciation less earned despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation fails past 120 words (no clear "who/where/when" anchor), capping Q3 at 7.0; closure is a valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the "latent sacrifice" isn't dramatized—unraveling happens mechanically without visible hesitation or tactile struggle to charge the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bamboo forest and orchard create vivid atmosphere, but setting remains decorative backdrop; the amber bead’s warmth briefly constrains choice (triggering puzzle assembly), yet no element pressures tactics or charges the final image per 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract ("impossible distance," "latent sacrifice") without concrete on-page testing; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a meaningful tightening—no moment where bamboo physically blocks her or puzzle pieces resist, leaving escalation underdeveloped despite coherent dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "raveling silence" and amber bead, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("threaded with hope") offers subtle conceptual repricing of sacrifice, though "latent sacrifice" risks thematic echo without deeper complexity in the resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whispering green stalks" and "hushed unraveling," but rhythmic control falters with repetitive cadences ("her hands... moved steadily, but her heart..."); overwriting dilutes pressure in peak beats like the puzzle assembly scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops (5 consecutive "The..." openings in the climax) and synonym churn ("raveling silence" repeated 4x); filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she carried") dull immediacy in the closure beat, directly obscuring the cost of unraveling the tapestry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tropes (exiled sibling, magical amber) feel familiar, but the bamboo forest orchard and rummage-sale-box discovery add fresh texture; emotional truth anchors the premise, yet the resolution lacks bold risk-taking to elevate beyond competent archetype transformation.</comment>
