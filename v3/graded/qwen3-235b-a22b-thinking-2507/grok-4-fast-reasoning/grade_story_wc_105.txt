<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong interiority via synesthetic perception ("blues sighing like ocean swells"), but final resilience realization lacks contradictory impulses in the climax beat; micro-choices under pressure remain abstract despite embodied scars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise: "memories' impact wasn't destruction, but a forge for resilience" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (tears + brine). Orientation anchors by word 20; meta-comment ("wait, that's over—") slightly dilutes closure intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse actively constrains choices (sea pressure, shipwrecks as sentinels) and charges final image (auroras through dome fissures). Bioluminescent fruit isn't decorative—it enables the synesthetic quest. Minor trope echo in "barnacles and forgotten cargo" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (auroras intensifying → violet as "fragile trill") under Accumulative lens. Dominant stake ("find sound of trust breaking") forecloses her path via the device's creation. Lacks visible price beyond emotional cost; "cells dividing" feels untracked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "collecting absences" → resilience realization. Final image ("sound of broken trust now a faint, healing hum") answers the central question without moralizing. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from concrete actions like pouring voids into molten alloy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reds humming low like distant thunder"), but rhythmic monotony in high-pressure forge scene ("battered marvel" repetition). Synesthetic descriptions avoid therapy-speak, though "battered determination" leans toward scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lethal artifact in climax: meta-comment "wait, that's over—trimming back mentally" breaks immersion and dulls closure. Otherwise strong ("voids where sounds should have been"), but paraphrase loop in "cells divided... knitting wounds" appears twice. Disqualifies 9+ globally per rubric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "broken trust" trope through synesthetic mechanics ("hears color as sound") and sunken-world specificity. Emotional truth elevates beyond gimmickry, though underwater greenhouse echoes familiar dystopian imagery. Risk-taking heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
