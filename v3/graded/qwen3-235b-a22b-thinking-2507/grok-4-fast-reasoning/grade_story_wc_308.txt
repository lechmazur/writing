<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak (resolve vs restlessness) but embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure shine; "pulse left wandering" revelation lacks flawed misbelief progression crucial for 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with felt cost ("wandering pulse stirred restlessly"), but cost proof test fails—restlessness lacks concrete on-page manifestation to reach 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust constrain choice (echo-shattering risk) and charge final image; "layered dust" micro-setting evolves causally with "dust-choked dawn" to "dust in the wind," meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through bird patterns, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the murmuration's "sudden veer" feels coincidental, not earned by Elara's action per Accumulative lens demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone/bird echoes without moralizing, but final line states resolution ("world would come to her") rather than reweighting prior material for 9-band resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("harmonics hummed in her veins") falters under pressure; "pulse left wandering" repetition creates template cadence, violating rhythmic control at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure, but "vibrations hummed in her veins" uses diagnostic label-speak in peak beat (-0.4), and "wheels... sliced... amplified" exhibits template cadence in bird sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of stone-skimming physics with spiritual navigation feels inevitable, but "wandering pulse" concept leans on familiar mystical artifact tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
