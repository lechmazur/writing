<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through tactile details (tracing telegram, weaving words in dreams) with contradictory impulses—grief vs. healing drive—compelling her closure choice. Mentor’s spectral appearance risks convenience but earns credibility via dream logic and the daylily’s recurring charge. No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak pitfalls. Final endurance (chronicling shared burdens) forecloses isolation with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly: star-dream density builds to Conceptual Repricing where stirring petals reweight "shared burdens" with undeniable social cost. Orientation anchors by line 10 (observatory, midnight, mentor’s telegram). Closure lands cleanly—dawn’s arrival mirrors insight, making the cost legible via the telegram’s revived petals. No causality breaks; pressure tightens through rhythmic stellar/dream patterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Daylily-pressed telegram functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (tracing it triggers dream state) and charging the final image (petals stir with insight). Sensory details—brass instruments’ glint, daylily’s fragrance—are selective and POV-filtered, narrowing under dream pressure. Observatory’s tools evolve causally (aligned dome enabling vision), avoiding white-room syndrome. Final image’s revival hinges entirely on this object’s specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding isolation’s cost) escalates through Elara’s agency: witnessing stellar rhythms in the dream directly alters her tactics (weaving empathetic words to lighten burdens). The cost—conceptual shift from solitary to communal healing—is unmistakable in the final image’s stirring petals. No coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres via her active interpretation of variable stars’ "ebb and flow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the temple inscription’s transformation ("What one carries alone crushes...") and the dream’s weight-passing ritual, avoiding moralizing. Final image—revived daylily petals—offers resonant, non-literal answer to "shared burdens" without stating a moral. Epiphany earned via visceral struggle (figures’ ethereal weights), not abstraction. No thematic echo; wisdom arises from concrete dream actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct: star-focused lexicon ("Cepheid’s rhythmic glow," "cosmic staircase") mirrors her occupation, with rhythmic control deepening under dream pressure. Perceptual signature shines in tactile details (telegram’s "fragile relic" texture). Minor density in opening ("midnight solace wrapping... familiar shawl") slightly dulls immediacy, but compression serves accumulative lens. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during trance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with varied syntax, but adjacent lines risk paraphrase loops ("worn leather chair, the midnight solace wrapping... inviting her to merge dream and starlight"). Figurative language stays purposeful (stars as "celestial beacons" echoing emotions), though "stirring memories" slightly echoes "fragile relic" earlier. Final image’s clarity (petals "stir... revived") avoids closure muddle, but mid-story density nudges toward scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lucid dream chronicler + variable stars transforms "shared burdens" trope via cosmic specificity (Cepheid pulses syncing with emotional rhythms). Emotional truth anchors universals—grief made tangible through daylily’s decay/revival. Avoids safety middle by leaning into lyric risk (dream procession as closure), yet coherence holds. No derivative echoes; every detail (temple inscriptions, brass instruments) serves the central calculus.</comment>
