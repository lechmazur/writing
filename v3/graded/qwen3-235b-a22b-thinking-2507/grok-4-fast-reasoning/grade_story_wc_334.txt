<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (scientific folklorist vs nostalgic seeker) drives tangible micro-choices like tracing spore patterns; embodied "crisp, nostalgic ache" avoids label-speak. Flaw: memory loss's present-life cost remains abstract despite vivid recovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "surfaced decades' worth of loss" crystallizes stakes through sensory reclamation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each detail (shipwrecks, spore constellations) tightens atmospheric coil without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse constrains every choice (diving suit, mooring to wreck chain) and charges closure via "ethereal glow" reweighting the spectral apples. Shipwrecks supply critical resources; brackish water impedes movement, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (reclaiming fragmented heritage) tighten through atmospheric pressure, but present-life consequences of memory loss lack concrete manifestation. Escalation via density increase ("broken constellations" discovery) works, yet cost remains felt not visible—insufficient for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: spore patterns mirroring shattered stars reweight "stolen memories" as both gift and burden. Final image ("crisp, nostalgic instant") offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers stained with earth's secrets," "oar cutting crisp lines") modulates under pressure. Near-flawless rhythmic control; minor deduction for "chronically curious" momentarily drifting into clinical diction amid poetic flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "barnacle-crusted anchor chain" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language serves pressure ("kelp like forgotten guardians"), never muddles. Peak-beat syntax ("traced the patterns... hum rose") accelerates without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "fairy ring" trope through marine decay setting and folklorist's scientific lens. "Broken constellations in spore ridges" synthesizes myth with tangible detail. Avoids safety middle but risks no structural experimentation to elevate to 9+.</comment>
