<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Claustrophobia is viscerally embodied ("breath hitched," "tremor in chest"), but "prudently adventurous" remains a label without contradictory impulses—no moment shows hesitation versus boldness in tension. Final choice lacks earned micro-choices under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure as the nexus "sighed in release" with visible cost (phobia lifted), anchored by Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation test passed early, but organ resolution edges toward coincidence rather than protagonist-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shadowed nexus actively constrains choices (shifting walls, narrowing passages), and compass point charges the final image as a micro-setting. "Fallow period" lacks temporal pressure, but starlight fissure’s evolving role with the Keystone elevates specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claustrophobia vs. key quest) tightens coherently, but escalation relies on the organ’s external reverberation rather than protagonist agency. Cost ("weight lifting phobia") is visible yet undercut by "wistful triumph" sentimentality in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>"Spatial mutiny" theme emerges through concrete particulars (walls weeping, vibrational paths), avoiding moralizing. However, repetitive "rebellion" motif risks thematic echo, and final "prudent rebellion" line flirts with abstract summarization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows danced like mutinous spirits") modulates rhythm under pressure, but "prudently adventurous" breaks lexicon consistency. Semicolon overuse in high-stakes beats slightly dulls immediacy without disrupting focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero closure-impacting loops; "fractals of space unfolding" shows crystalline specificity. Minor deduction for "wistful rebellion" repetition (synonym churn) and "transfixing essence" abstraction in mid-beat, though propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia with spatial fantasy tropes (compass as divining rod), but "Keystone" feels derivative. Highest marks for transforming "fallow period" from vague setting into thematic pressure point through earned stakes.</comment>
