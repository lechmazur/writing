<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but slightly abstract; "shadowed elation" leans toward label-speak without deeper contradictory impulses beyond sorrow/joy duality. Final choice to extinguish wick earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (his fading form), held under Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates via escalating visions that reweight stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass wick constrains choices throughout (steering based on refractions) and charges final image as it dims. Setting details actively shape tactics: internal reflection mechanics enable shadow manipulation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through prophetic visions narrowing options; agency in steering shadows toward renewal creates visible cost (obsolescence). Escalation driven by protagonist's choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: "accidental prophecies woven into its core" answers renewal question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while sustaining complexity about obsolescence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("verdant promise against void") with rhythmic control matching herald's state. Compression taught early; no head-hopping despite lyrical density under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("dance as eternal as tides") and one paraphrase loop ("steering... funneling them"). No artifacts in final third, but density slightly blurs pressure in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mythos with post-digital age; "accidentally prophetic" transforms oracle trope. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional specificity edges toward abstraction.</comment>
