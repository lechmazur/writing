<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (desire for Lira vs fear of erasure), but "blissfully aberrant" veers toward abstract label rather than embodied trait; micro-choices like swatch-card anchoring feel authentic under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the ship's lurch denying the shore vision crystallizes trapped freedom with visceral cost ("solace remaining unkindled"); accumulative lens holds through memory shifts without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The carnival ship actively constrains choice (nowhere to drift but the vessel), with the emerald swatch charging the final image; rusted rails and moldy plush toys filter through Elara’s hybrid perception, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the ship lurches, denying the shore vision and foreclosing escape; cost is legible ("freedom illusory"), but escalation leans textural over causal, missing one decisive pressure point for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "trapped freedom" embodied in drifting ship/mist, not stated; final vow to "weave until the garden claimed them" reweights prior hope with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—hybrid identity shapes all description ("scales beneath skin," "funhouse mirror twisting"); rhythm modulates from lyrical ("calliope ghosts") to staccato under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "faded Ferris wheel cars dangling like broken dreams" exemplifies high-density propulsion; minor overwriting ("unkindled solace") avoids muddle, with final line’s "emerald swatch her anchor" crystallizing momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "search for twin" trope via narrative-thread mechanics and carnival ship setting; "blissfully aberrant" avoids quirkiness by charging closure, though chimera premise lacks radical reconfiguration for 9+.</comment>
