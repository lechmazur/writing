<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in copper veins aching with loss yet flaring with resolve during visions; closure choice to endure curse is earned through texture-feeling micro-choices. Minor deduction for emotional progression lacking irrationality beyond physical embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orientation clear by word 15 ("canyon of endless echoes"); closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "visions assailed him—kings crumbling to dust—but Elar endured." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through density increase in textures-to-tones transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Tunnel of echoes functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("canyon now a living archive where textures sang forever"), while mineral dew constrains tactics through humming contact. Sensory details like "velvety hope of rebirth" perfectly filter urgency through Elar's tactile focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elar's agency under Accumulative lens: aligning diamond with bird formations reweights the stake through density increase. Cost is unmistakable in "copper veins flaring like forges" during curse-induced visions, narrowing options to endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("textures sang forever") offers resonant non-literal answer to language preservation without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete struggle—grit of oaths becoming gravelly chords—not abstract statements, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "words emerging like whispers carved from stone," with rhythmic control intensifying under pressure ("grit of ancient oaths echoed as gravelly chords"). Zero head-hopping; elision of language's demise taught early and paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "mineral dew that hummed against his skin" exemplifies triple-duty prose. Final line recharges opening echoes with conceptual precision. Zero figurative muddle—every metaphor ("cracked like a shattered promise") serves causal logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tactile language preservation avoids tropes through specific mechanics (shadowbirds tracing "roughness of exile"). Risk-taking in textural-to-acoustic transformation heightens stakes coherently, passing transformation test with copper veins as irreplaceable conduit.</comment>
