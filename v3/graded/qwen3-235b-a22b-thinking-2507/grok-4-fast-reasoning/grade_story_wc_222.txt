<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction under pressure lacks concrete manifestation; "cautious abandon" remains abstract despite high stakes, no visible struggle between wonder and fear during guardian fight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong causal closure (king swap stabilizes sky) with felt cost (sweat, hesitation), but orientation anchors arrive too late—spire setting clarified only at paragraph 3, violating 120-word rule.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice crystals as "wary eyes" and sundial's star-rhythm constrain choices; spire's frost pedestal supplies critical resources, though micro-setting (chess board) doesn't alter final swap mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single tightening (guardians' appearance) narrows options, but escalation lacks consequence—spectral foes weaken instantly after one swap without compounding cost on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Final image of Elias as "architect of balance" reweights "thief" motif non-literally, but "chivalrous thief" concept isn't tested against mission urgency for deeper thematic friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("auroras bled unnatural colors") but therapy-speak surfaces under stress ("heart a drum of abandon tempered by care"), muddying voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Template cadence in swap sequence ("With gloved hands steady... In its place... He approached") creates rhythmic monotony; "festering like doubt" overwrites a critical beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms thief trope via "sacred play" mechanic, but "fractured sky" crisis feels generic; wonder-carved pieces offer fresh specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
