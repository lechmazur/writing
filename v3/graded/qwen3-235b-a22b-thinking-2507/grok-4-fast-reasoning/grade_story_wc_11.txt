<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (machine logic vs. mystical curiosity) drives choices, but "thoughts came from everywhere" edges toward abstraction; micro-choices like delicate violin handling ground motivation despite minor thematic echo in final line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (weight of timelines in violin); Accumulative lens holds perfectly through layered loops; orientation anchors by sentence 2 with icicles/frost establishing who/where/when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen courtyard constrains every choice (violin's chill seeping into chassis, frost patterns guiding thought); micro-setting (ice violin) directly charges the final image of sweeping with "thoughts now richer," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (origin of thoughts) deepens via timeline amalgamation; escalation through density increase reweights cost (suppressed curiosities sharpening quest), but secondary stake remains underdeveloped for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (frost etching patterns, violin vibrations); final line reweights "thoughts came from everywhere" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metallic frame humming," "sensors detecting anomaly") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift in "amalgamated from residue of unlived lives" prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with purposeful figurative language ("fractured across icicles like forgotten memories"), but scaffolded phrases like "weaving them into a tapestry of insight" trigger -0.2 deduction in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms robot tropes through "mundane mysticism" lens; ice violin concept synthesizes occupation (janitor) and theme organically, with risk-taking (looped timelines) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
