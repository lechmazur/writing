<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over embodied contradiction; "yearning for texture of connection" lacks visceral tradeoffs. Micro-choices shine (lens adjustment revealing empathy) but final renunciation lacks felt cost—grid stabilization undercuts sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (lab "breathing with possibility"), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—grid stability negates implied fragility. Accumulative lens holds through sound-layer escalation, yet stakes lack tangible consequence at threshold moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lab setting actively constrains choices: carbide lens refracts light/sound to alter tactics, and "golden shadows" charge closure ("breathes with possibility"). Micro-setting as environment passes 9+ gate—tool and recurring object shape final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</comment>Stakes escalate through Elara’s questioning ("Why demand proximity?"), tightening pressure via sound-layer deepening. But dominant stake ("texture of connection") stays abstract—no visceral price paid despite grid’s fragility, weakening cost legibility at climax.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through gravel-textured giggles and velvet voices, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("bonds woven from questions") reweights premise, but brother’s reappearance as "bridge not specter" slightly undercuts grief’s cost, diluting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "acetylene-ghosted lens," "sapphire highs" filter Elara’s tech-poetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("golden shadows lengthened" for climax). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via "simulated odyssey" framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("crimson lows of rumbling earth") with zero scaffold loops. Minor overwriting in "velvet against the soul—smooth yet resilient" risks mixed metaphor, but rhythm variation sustains propulsion through pivotal closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms VR grief tropes via sonic specificity (factory hum as "fibrous" connection), but "artificial pilgrimage" framing feels derivative. Fresh inflection in carbide lens physics—though emotional resolution avoids risk by stabilizing the grid prematurely.</comment>
