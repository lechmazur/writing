<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her pacifism vs inherited knife, but compressed backstory limits father's legacy depth; final renunciation of violence through sheathing the knife earns visible cost with the embedded petal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: dome crack escalates pressure via sensory density, closure as Earned Stasis when calm mends glass with petal's cost legible in "stabilized, not from force." Orientation clear by line 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain every choice—scrap anchors ritual, thorns guide incision—and final bloom recharges "tranquil blaze" with undeniable cost; micro-setting qualifies as essential environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sanctuary vs chaos) tightens meaningfully when dome cracks; her agency in embedding the petal reconfigures options under Accumulative lens, cost crystallized in the stabilized crack's quiet victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not moralizing: "engraved quiet" reweighted in final bloom as beacon against night, avoiding binaries; no thematic echo, only resonant image answering chaos with quiet endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("senselessly perceptive" soil pulses) drives syntax; rhythm modulates from lyrical calm to staccato crisis without POV slippage; "tranquil blaze" refrain deepens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "petals unfurling like flames frozen in quiet defiance" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat; final line’s density ("engraved quiet a beacon") achieves crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via specific gardening ritual; "inculcating peace" feels fresh, though desert rose symbolism borders on expected—avoids safety middle with pacifism as active sheathing, not passivity.</comment>
