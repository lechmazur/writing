<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s "luminous vows" versus lamplighter routine; micro-choices like clutching the tag as a compass reveal hierarchy of values. Final dive choice is earned by childhood vow’s embodied weight. Slight lack of visible struggle during descent slightly weakens endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: the orb’s indigo glow reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("hiding behind truth dissolved"). Orientation clear by 100 words; Accumulative lens held consistently through sensory density. Cost legible in "key tag spent but purpose ignited."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae functions as micro-setting object that charges closure ("hush lingering like a promise kept"). Pier-to-shipwreck progression constrains choices via tide timing. Minor vagueness in cove path description prevents 9.5+, but final image’s amber-lit library meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: childhood vow ("discover color of sound") tightens via sky lanterns mirroring sea glow, narrowing options to the dive. Agency-driven escalation; cost unmistakable in "purpose ignited" altering his relationship to lamplighting. No redundant moves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "hiding behind truth" transforms from metaphor to lived reality via the orb’s indigo revelation. Final image ("hush lingering like a promise kept") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing sound’s hue rather than stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("skeletal finger into ink-black sea" filtered through lamplighter’s synesthetic lens). Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during dive). Consistent third-limited POV; no head-hopping. "Meteor hush" repetition borders on tic but serves thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("Bubbles trailed like unspoken words"). Figurative language enhances clarity ("luminous vows whispered to stars"). Final line recharges "hush" motif with precision. Minor cliché ("coral-crusted tomb") redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic quest transforms "impossible dream" trope through specific indigo revelation. Every detail serves premise (sky lanterns mirroring sea glow). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off; "color of sound" feels inevitable yet fresh. Avoids abstraction via pier lamplighter’s tactile world.</comment>
