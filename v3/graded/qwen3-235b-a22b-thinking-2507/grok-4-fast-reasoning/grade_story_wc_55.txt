<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in trembling quill and micro-choice to place the clock face as "relic," not burden. Embodied emotion avoids labels; cost is felt in "abandoned dream, once a sharp ache, now lay integrated." No diagnostic speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: renunciation of regret forecloses the path of obsession, with visible cost in the "sharp ache" now integrated. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through petrichor/crystal pattern. Meta-comment about word count slightly muddies closure purity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice—Elias kneels amid shards, placing the clock face where light refracts. Petrichor scent triggers embodied memory, charging the final image where "rain-slick stones held the dawn's secret light." Environment directly shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: his decision to place the clock face reconfigures options, trading regret for integration. Cost is legible in "peace settle, excruciatingly gentle, like the first thaw," but escalation lacks one deeper pressure point to reach 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the unfinished clock face becomes a "relic to honor," not a burden. Final image ("sanctuary felt less like refuge and more like home") reweights the premise without moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity about abandonment and peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clockmaker notices "facets refracting hidden sunrise" and "gears danced under his fingers." Rhythmic control varies ("Slipping through a side door" vs. "The ground gleamed wet"), with no head-hopping or register drift under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters with the intrusive meta-comment ("Wait, recount: actually, the true count aligns..."). Otherwise, high density ("petrichor nostalgia wrap around him") avoids loops. Artifact in final third disallows 9+ despite strong imagery elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned dream" trope through clockmaker specificity: petrichor as emotional trigger, crystals as physical manifestation of time. Risk-taking in quiet Earned Stasis closure feels inevitable, but lacks one fresh inflection to breach 9.0.</comment>
