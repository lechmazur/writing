<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (numbness vs. seeking spark) embodied through callused hands tracing hides and vibration-focused choices; final change earned by backward song's tactile assault on emotional frost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—tears as "silent rivers" crystallizing the receding numbness—under Accumulative/Textural lens where density shift (vibrations intensifying to "jolt") reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern's resonance constrains her method (amplifying earth's pulses) and charges rebirth imagery; micro-setting (phonograph horn as "petrified bloom") directly enables the climax's vibration transmission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (defeating numbness) tightens through agency-driven escalation—beeswax repair and backward play narrow options to feeling or void—with cost legible in the tears' silent rivers foreclosing emotional barrenness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" reweights as guide through hush in final line, avoiding moralizing while resonating the core question; numbness-to-rebirth arc emerges from cylinder grooves and bone vibrations without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (vibration-focused lexicon like "irregular pulses travel up her arms") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and "wool"-muted air reflects her deafness consistently.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high-density propulsion ("vibrations intensified... each reversed note a jolt") with no figurative muddle in peak beats—every phrase advances tactile atmosphere toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deaf music teacher using backward phonograph vibrations for emotional rekindling avoids safety middle; emotional specificity in "bone-fire" rebirth feels earned, though premise risks slight familiarity.</comment>
