<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion via frost patterns and prism warmth, but sister estrangement lacks prior contradictory impulses; micro-choices like tracing ice vines reveal values only late in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: assumptions shatter when frost reveals sister's face, with felt cost in Elara's tears absorbed by the prism; Accumulative lens holds through pattern shifts in frost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor constrains choice by providing prism's light source and charges final image with "quartz tears"; mist/frost patterns actively shape communion method and emotional revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving emotional absorption) tightens via frost pattern transformation, but cost remains abstract until climax; sister's face emergence narrows options through irreversible realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reflection vs. absorption emerges through prism/frost mechanics; final image ("objects reflect... urging healing") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crystalline arches caught the fog like captured dreams"; psychic distance shifts intentionally during trance; no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "doubts had crept in, challenging her belief" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise high density with concrete verbs ("clutched," "angled," "tracing") driving propulsion through pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mysticism and urban setting avoids tropes; "shifted hush" concept transforms through frost mechanics rather than abstraction; specificity of quartz arbor grounds universals.</comment>
