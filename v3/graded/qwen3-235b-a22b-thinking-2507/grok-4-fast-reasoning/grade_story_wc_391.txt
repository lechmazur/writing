<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "sculpt patience from impatience" motivation drives credible change in Thorne, but off-page transformation ("days blurred into weeks") lacks micro-choices during pivotal shifts, weakening embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the cracked lake under moonlight crystallizes the revolution's cost (thawing patience vs. tyranny's freeze) with undeniable conceptual weight under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary's volcanic memory and frozen lake directly constrain choices—viaduct crossing relies on post-rain magnetic pull—while the cracking ice charges the final image with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through moon-path observation's tangible cost (Thorne's clenched fists softening), but the viaduct solution feels slightly convenient; escalation lacks a visceral, on-page loss during the crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically: "restrained wildness" reframes revolution as magnetic pull, not explosion; final image reweights patience as active force without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline silence," "languid arc") modulates rhythm under pressure; "softly purposeful" refrain evolves meaning without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in Thorne's off-page change ("impotence thawing like spring") dulls momentum; otherwise, high-density prose avoids loops but risks slight overwriting in atmospheric beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of patience as revolutionary tactic transforms familiar rebellion tropes; "magnetic pull toward freedom" avoids abstraction through basalt/viaduct specificity and earned emotional complexity.</comment>
