<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("itch to impose order" vs. "mind quivered in reverie") grounds motivation in embodied emotion; final disintegration choice earns transformation through prior causality. Micro-choices under retrocognitive pressure (pressing shard to arch) reveal value hierarchy with cost ("forever changed"). Lacks secondary pressure but single-POV execution compensates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("forever changed by the texture") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3 ("Elias wandered..."); retrocognitive trap escalation reweights stakes via density increase. Minor orientation timing prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure cost ("syncing with his breath" crystallizes options).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Living bridge garden functions as micro-setting charging closure: vines supply resource for disintegration ("pressed against a vine-woven arch"), final pulse sync reconfigures meaning. Sensory specificity ("grains of sandpaper regret") reflects urgency under pressure. Meets 9+ gate—environment constrains choice and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (tracing time's texture) tighten through retrocognitive visions that narrow options to disintegration. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens: hyperbolic folding choice forecloses the trap with visible cost (transformation). Cost ("forever changed") legible but slightly abstract; minor deduction prevents 9.0 despite perfect escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fading photographs" motif evolves from childhood trauma to visions with "rough like bark" texture. Final disintegration offers non-literal answer via "raw texture—grains of sandpaper regret," avoiding moralizing. Resonant closure reweights time's erosion without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tremor of a half-remembered dream," "quaking reverie") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control in visions ("rough like bark... slick and dissolving"). Purposeful elision taught early ("hyperbolic folds") pays off in closure. Near-9.0 but minor syntactic repetition ("quaking reverie") in high-pressure beat prevents full score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but "quaking reverie" repetition (lines 15, 21) creates paraphrase loop dulling momentum. No closure artifacts; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently. Final line ("texture he had touched") avoids abstraction, but scaffold deduction caps at 8.7 despite otherwise exceptional craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry with temporal perception transforms maze-design trope. Specific details (halo fragment's "solidified memory" warmth) feel earned through prior particulars. Avoids abstraction with verifiable stakes ("fading photographs" material consequence). Near-9.0 but motivation echoes familiar grief tropes slightly.</comment>
