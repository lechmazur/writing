<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation in rope reconfiguration beats, but "snowmelt ardor" diagnostic label violates peak-beat embodiment rules; micro-choices under pressure (gentle braid work) compensate partially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation delayed past 120 words (sanctum details precede character motivation), triggering −0.3 penalty; closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (tears/weight lifting), but orientation debt caps Q3 at 7.0 per rubric.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum constrains tactics (cold affecting rope work), but Q2 orientation penalty caps score at 7.0; aurora’s light-weaving charges final image yet fails 9+ gate requiring environment to charge closure image due to cap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through rope reconfiguration with visible cost (sweat/trembling), but dominant stake ("preserve forgotten names") isn’t signaled early enough; escalation lacks one clear causal beat narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through transcribed memory mechanics, not moralizing; final image ("living transcribed memory against silence") reweights prior material non-literally, avoiding thematic echo despite minor abstraction in "resilient as metal forged".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("callused fingers," "wax-shaped touch") shines under pressure; no head-hopping, but "snowmelt ardor" phrasing drifts into non-POV lexicon during high-stakes rope work, risking voice contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose prose (e.g., "aurora intensified... casting glows that danced across her labor"), but "snowmelt ardor" and "frozen breaths of elders" form stock metaphor strings in peak beats, triggering −0.5 loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost-wax casting with sound preservation; risk-taking (rope as loom) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "aurora-veiled night" risks generic Arctic cliché despite specific ritual mechanics.</comment>
