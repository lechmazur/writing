<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between truth-seeking and inherited lies is embodied through physical interaction with scuffs/lattice, but "I am not my father's echo" borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient visceral contradiction in the moment. Micro-choices like palm-pressing reveal values, though emotional progression lacks deeper irrationality beyond the core conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise through "father's wolf long tamed into repose," crystallizing stance with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of inheritance lighter"). Orientation anchors instantly in copperlight/dusk, and Accumulative lens holds via density increase (memories merging with scuffs) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lattice functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("shadow lingering... hovering like a promise") and constrains choice (kneeling to speak through it), though "copperlight" motif occasionally veers toward generic coastal tropes without fully shaping mid-scene tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through Accumulative density—scuffs merging with memories narrows options by transforming denial into acceptance. Dominant stake (escaping legacy) tightens via Elias's agency (threading story through lattice), with cost legible in "weight of inheritance lighter" as conceptual reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "wolf long tamed" reweights the cry-wolf premise without moralizing. Final image answers the central question via charged metaphor, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity—Elias's truth-seeking isn't redemption but repose, charged by the lattice's shadow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight," "hush," "hovering") modulates rhythm under pressure, though "repulseful glow" (likely typo for reposeful) and slight lexical slippage in confessional description undermine otherwise controlled focalization. No head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "chasing the hush" repetitions (3x) slightly dulls momentum, but high density prevails—"lattice vibrating" crystallizes pressure without figurative muddle. Closure beat remains sharp with "sea whispered approval," though "translucent shapes" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cry-wolf myth through coastal prison setting and "chasing hush" concept, with specific verifiable detail (confessional from wrecked chapel ship). Emotional truth avoids templates, though legacy-redemption arc feels slightly familiar despite strong execution.</comment>
