<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but lacks contradictory impulses; Harlan's backstory summary weakens embodied conflict despite strong final choice to deliver the box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (regret→action), but "vibrant hush" repetition dilutes causality; cost legibility slightly obscured by lyrical emphasis over tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (music box mechanism) constrains choices and charges final image; dust motes/light beam evolve causally with emotional arc, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias' realization of his failure, but "deserve" concept remains thematic rather than driving tactical choices; storm climax lacks causal pressure on decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through clockwork heart's reprise without moralizing; "second opinions" integrates via Thorne's action, avoiding Thematic Echo despite near-final dialogue line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (dust motes, brass veins), but "aptly deliberate" repetition creates uniform tics; voice modulates effectively under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" appears 3× as template cadence in high-pressure beats; lyrical density occasionally obscures propulsion though final image avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through specific occupational detail (clockwork repair); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
