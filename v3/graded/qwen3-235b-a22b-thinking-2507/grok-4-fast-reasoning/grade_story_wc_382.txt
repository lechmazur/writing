<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (curiosity vs caution) drive her micro-choices; Thorne's "agreed upon lies" reveal layered motives. Slight opacity in his backstory costs 0.1, but earned trust shift via rooftop interrogation feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: wax seal imprint under meteors crystallizes Elara's shift from "eerie whispers" to "lullaby of endurance" with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative lens held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Building functions as micro-setting—warping floors and cornerstone emblem constrain choices. Desk seal's final imprint charges closure; meteors' "ozone" and "weathered bricks" reweight prior sensory details with thematic precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding building's true language) tightens through "agreed upon lies" into rooftop interrogation. Conceptual cost—accepting haunted legacy as "lullaby of endurance"—is unmistakable under Accumulative lens. No escalation flaws.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "grief in sagging beams, joy in arched windows," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "silent stories etched into stone" into active communion, offering non-literal answer to central question with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature shines: noticing "faded cornerstone emblem" while others hear creaks. Sentence rhythms vary from lyrical ("twilight bled into night") to taut interrogation. Minor repetition of "mysterious familiarity" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Steam from Earl Grey mingled with aged books and wax" exemplifies multi-sensory propulsion. Zero loops; "lullaby of endurance" crystallizes accumulation. Deduct 0.1 for "patiently nimble" repetition, but it serves thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms haunted house trope via linguistic lens—architecture as emotional archive. "Agreed upon lies" as trust-building device feels fresh; avoids cliché by making supernatural feel like emotional archaeology. Risk elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
