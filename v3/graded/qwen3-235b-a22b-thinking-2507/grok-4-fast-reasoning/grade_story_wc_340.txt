<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to "seek joy beneath anguish" is embodied through micro-choices like deciphering the diary with affectionate detachment, avoiding therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses (detachment vs. deep engagement) act simultaneously during the diary reading, earning her final readiness to serve. Lacks one visceral physical reaction under stress to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: each floor’s diary revelation deepens the dominant stake through density increase and cadence shifts, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elara’s transformed stance crystallizes with conceptual cost ("diary clutched close, its secrets now a gentle companion"). Orientation is anchored by line 5; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s choice to decipher runes and charging the final image ("goggles dimming, ready to serve"). Sensory details (frost-etched walls, humming leather) are POV-filtered and purposeful. Slight overreliance on visual descriptions in the elevator ascent prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via diary revelations intensifies Elara’s internal stake ("seek joy beneath anguish") under the Accumulative lens, narrowing her emotional options until the spire-top closure. Cost is legible in her shift from detached curiosity to charged readiness. Missing one tangible consequence of her discovery on immediate tactics holds it below 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through Captain Thorne’s diary entries and Elara’s actions—joy as hidden light refracted through anguish—without moralizing. The final image reweights the spire’s purpose as a "beacon," offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Lacks one subtle gesture that deepens thematic ambiguity to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara’s light-focused noticing ("scattered light danced like hesitant fireflies"), with rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., fragmented clauses during decryption). Voice modulates from inquisitive to resonant without head-hopping. Minor register drift in "method through scattered light" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, but "fond curiosity for the secrets others buried, as if she were an old friend peering gently" risks paraphrase-looping. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final line’s specificity ("newfound light") elevates closure. Template cadence in floor transitions caps score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Organic synthesis of cloud-city tropes: the "ascending servant" role transforms "joy beneath anguish" into a non-obvious service ethic, avoiding safety-hedging. Fresh inflection in using scattered light as decryption method feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in Elara’s detachment elevates risk without gimmickry.</comment>
