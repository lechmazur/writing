<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in molting trait remains abstract; "bold visionary" shift lacks on-page testing under pressure. Strengths: embodied emotion in ink-stained hands, credible micro-choices while sorting books.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("suspicion heavy in the air") and persistent constraint (guard scrutiny). Coffee tin smuggling creates tangible pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted shelves actively constrain rebuilding efforts ("groaning back to life"), while moonlight's "luminous fracture" evolves from setting detail to closure-charging motif. Final "garden in gravel" image charges stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when guards' flashlight pierces the yard, but cost remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt on Elias/Marcus. Resource scarcity creates credible pressure but lacks concrete trade-off demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "dog-eared pages and whispered alliances," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("poetry and friendship could hammer chaos") risks sentimentality but saved by concrete "garden in gravel" resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous fracture," "anarchy of confined souls") shines, though "skeletal sanctuary" borders on purple prose. Consistent third-limited POV with no head-hopping; dialogue sparse but natural.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("fractured glows/fractured order") and telling ("forge beauty from raw disorder") prevent 9.0. Strong propulsion in rebuilding sequences; final line avoids overwriting with concrete "garden in gravel" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms prison library trope through coffee tin smuggling and personality molting. "Blooming resistance" as embodied action (binding books) avoids abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
