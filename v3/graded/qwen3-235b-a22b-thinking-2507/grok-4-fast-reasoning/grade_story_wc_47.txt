<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Elara’s micro-choices (fingering pendant vs offering it), but "vulnerability wrapped around her like a protective shroud" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty. Flaws complicate choices credibly, though Kai’s interiority lacks equal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: pendant resting between them reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3, but cost proof ("thawing icicles" pattern) feels slightly abstract versus tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moss garden constrains choices (Kai sketching overgrowth; server seating), but setting doesn’t actively charge the final image—pendant/icicles drive closure. Sensory details vivid yet selective, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (reclaiming meaning from trauma), with icicle pattern deepening pressure. But escalation lacks protagonist agency; thawing drip inspires but doesn’t narrow Elara’s options. Cost felt but not unmistakable per Q4 quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through amber’s reweighting ("light preserved through time"), avoiding moralizing. Final image answers central question by transforming pendant into "beacon of grafted hope," though "graft new meaning" borders on thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractal veins of water tracing paths like veins of memory") shines. Minor register drift in "method of this natural inscription" and "honeyed hush" overuse slightly blunt pressure under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Two prose artifacts: mixed metaphor ("vulnerability wrapped... protective shroud") and template cadence ("She moved... She paused... She stopped"). Not in closure beat but prevent 9+ eligibility per penalty rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital decay/nature imagery avoids tropes (servers cradling moss). "Honeyed hush" concept feels earned, but doesn’t reach 9+’s "inevitable in hindsight" standard despite risk-taking.</comment>
