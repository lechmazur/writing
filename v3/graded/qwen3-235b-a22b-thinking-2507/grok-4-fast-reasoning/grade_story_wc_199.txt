<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between order and poetic intuition shines in micro-choices like prodding leaves, though "motivation burned like hidden ember" edges toward label. Transformation earned through tangible monument-building, not abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: final dew image crystallizes irreversible change with felt cost ("orderly nature now laced with poetic intuition"). Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—transformation feels unearned in its ease.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ashen arbor constrains choices (leaves as messages, monuments from bark/lichen) and charges closure ("pulsed with delight"). POV-filtered details like "mossy delight" avoid white-room syndrome, though "cryptic symbols" slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing ashen skies) signaled early, pressure deepens via accumulating specks. But opposition is absent—no cost beyond perspective shift, weakening escalation. "Coming bloom" creates tangible stakes yet lacks concrete threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of order/wild balance emerges through monuments and final "sacred rite" reconfiguration. Avoids moralizing, but "message was one of balance" slightly overt. Final image ("woven into living myth") offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("leaves fluttered like parchment from forgotten scribes") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift in "prodding bits of bark" slightly distances, yet voice control remains exemplary throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with phrases like "visions flooded her mind—images of forgotten epochs," but template cadence in monument descriptions ("miniature spire... wee archway") creates subtle loops. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological folklore and personal transformation. "Building tiny monuments" method feels specific, though moonstone trope slightly familiar. Bold risk in lyric Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
