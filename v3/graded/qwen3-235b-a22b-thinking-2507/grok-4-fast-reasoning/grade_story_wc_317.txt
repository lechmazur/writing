<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete sensory engagement but lacks contradictory impulses; "notably receptive" trait remains label-only without testing under pressure. Final choice to plant seed lacks visible cost escalation beyond business stagnation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "revolution" claim remains conceptual without on-page felt consequence. Accumulative lens holds but final image ("mysteries flowed freely") lacks undeniable pressure reconfiguration despite strong lyrical buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brook setting actively constrains choices (planting location, sensory misdirection concept) and charges final image. "Storm-born silence" motif evolves from atmosphere to thematic engine with precise sensory hierarchy reflecting Elias' urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) remains abstract; pressure never materializes as concrete on-page test. Planting seed presents no meaningful trade-off or narrowing of options, failing Band 8.0+ requirement for live option foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through seed/brook motifs but resolution ("sown the future") lacks earned complexity. Final image avoids moralizing yet falls short of resonant non-literal answer required for Q5≥8.0, capped by Q4 failure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("wooden cabin tucked among willows") and rhythmic control under contemplative pressure. Minor register drift when "orthogonal approaches" interrupts organic thought flow, but elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Zero loops with high density; "loamy soil clinging eagerly" exemplifies textural specificity. "Notably receptive" repetition creates subtle synonym churn in high-pressure beats, preventing 9.0 despite masterful rhythm control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Fresh synthesis of horticulture/puzzle design feels inevitable yet specific. Avoids safety middle with "sensory misdirection" concept, but risk-taking stops short of bold structural choices that heighten stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
