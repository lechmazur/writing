<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (data vs. empathy) manifests in micro-choices like kneeling despite skepticism, but "courageously kind" leans toward label-speak; Lir’s grief lacks sufficient embodied specificity beyond tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—dawn light crystallizing entangled memories as bridges not chains—with felt cost in Lir’s posture shift and Elara’s tempered skepticism; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower’s stone floor and magic square constrain choices (clearing space, transcribing), while whale migration’s rhythmic pressure charges the final image; sensory details like salt air vibrations reflect urgency without checklist repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through transcription deepening into visions, narrowing Elara’s options from skepticism to embodied reflection; cost is legible in her shifted worldview, though whale migration’s timeframe lacks tactical pressure beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elara’s data-driven observations ("patterns in cosmos, not miracles") modulates under stress; lyrical compression ("whales' calls vibrating through salt air") taught early pays off in closure’s "full orchestra" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("silent twinkling," "unheard symphony" x2) and a filter-verb stack ("her skepticism wavered when visions flickered") dull peak-beat immediacy; otherwise, precise diction ("looms weaving threads") propels momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical harmony (4x4 magic square) with grief and migration avoids tropey mysticism; risk-taking in numeric specificity elevates emotional truth, though "skeptic meets supernatural" premise requires the tower’s concrete setting to feel non-generic.</comment>
