<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "balance self-respect with compassion" but "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats triggers -0.4 penalty; embodied choices like shedding naivety while applying gel earn high marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with visible cost (reporting Mira) under Accumulative lens; "dawn's first light pierced the mist" crystallizes the cost of shattered trust through the tail's elongation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Misty workshop constrains choices as micro-setting—the swirling mist during reconstruction directly alters tactics, and "mist parting like a curtain" at dawn charges the final image with transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake "fragile convictions" tightens meaningfully when Elias applies nutrient gel, foreclosing blind trust; cost feels earned though reporting Mira occurs off-page, slightly muddying the on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of regenerating tail reweights "fragile convictions" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by making hope tangible through biological miracle rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in "vines overhead" and "cool smoothness" tactile focus; rhythmic control deepens under pressure with "shimmering stillness" refrain modulating emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("shattered illusions"/"fragile convictions") and borderline anthropomorphism ("scales flickering... as if remembering") prevent 9.0; no loops in closure beat preserves momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wildlife handler trope—gentle nature as active resilience, not weakness; tail regrowth as non-metaphorical embodiment of trust rebuilding elevates beyond familiar arcs.</comment>
