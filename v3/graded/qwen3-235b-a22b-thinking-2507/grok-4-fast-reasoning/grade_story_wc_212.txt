<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("fingers trembled tracing runes"), motivation rooted in ancestral duty, but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; the "smiled" resolution undermines felt cost of preserving chaos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visceral cost ("velvet rasp" texture revelation), lens (Accumulative) holds from midpoint, but thawing ice at end slightly over-resolves the "perpetual ice" constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Icebound atrium actively constrains choices (seeds combat fracturing ice), yet "perpetual ice" melting to dew breaks environmental consistency without foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through entropy-weaving actions, cost legible in "fleeting yet enduring" texture, but "furiously tranquil" trait remains label-only without dramatized tradeoffs under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "borrowed time" texture motif; final dew-on-seeds image reweights entropy without moralizing, though "resilient, textured with lives sustained" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kernels," "frostbitten roots") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from "swirling mists" to "serene maelstrom" without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts, high density ("heart a storm caged in stillness"), but "Placing... Chanting... tracing" template cadence in action sequence slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-saving and entropy concepts; "velvet rasp" texture transforms sci-fi tropes through agricultural specificity, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
