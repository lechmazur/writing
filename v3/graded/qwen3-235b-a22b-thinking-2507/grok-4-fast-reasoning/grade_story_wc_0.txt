<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her shift from "needless drama" to humility, embodied through dust-stained fingers and trembling notebook. Micro-choices like capturing butterflies to "gently brush wings" reveal her reconfigured values with visible cost in the final equations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: releasing butterflies while sketching new equations forecloses her sensationalist past with tears and "humbling" cost. The Accumulative lens holds perfectly—dust patterns accumulate to reweight her cosmic understanding without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse decay actively constrains choices: salvaged solar panels power the microscope, osmotic pressure cracks pots, and brackish water shapes her movements. The final image of "slow decay a companion to her evolving mind" charges closure by mirroring her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency—her deliberate dust collection tightens options by replacing explosive simulations with gradual decay models. Cost is unmistakable in the "sodden notebook" and tears, though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point beyond internal reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: butterfly dust refracting light becomes the non-literal answer to cosmic drama, reweighting neutron star decay as "inexorable erosion." Final image of "patient rhythm" resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is stellar: her scientist’s gaze notices "chitinous nanostructures" and "fractal designs," with syntax tightening during microscope work. No head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical ("brackish water") to lyrical ("shedding one last dusting as they vanished").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "glass shards glittered like fallen stars" earns its metaphor through cosmic parallelism. Minor cadence drag in "Humility kindled within her, a slow burn..." slightly dulls momentum, but final line’s "patient rhythm" delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astrophysics and lepidopterology feels inevitable—butterfly dust revealing stellar decay isn’t gimmickry but earned through her humility arc. Risks lyrical structure yet maintains causality, transforming "gradual change" from abstraction to visceral truth.</comment>
