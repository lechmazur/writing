<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her pursuit of vanished paths versus haunting bleaching memories, embodied through tactile tapping rhythms. Final realization earns closure through prior causality, though "periodically eternal" concept lacks full integration into micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: shifted paths reconfigure loss with conceptual cost ("paths rediscovered in quiet assembly"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but mid-story lens ambiguity slightly clouds escalation before the model assembly deepens pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sea station’s micro-setting excels—solar panels, hydrophones, and atlas constrain choices, charging the final image. Misses 9+ gate as "periodically eternal" concept remains thematic rather than environment/tool concretely shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: assembling the model forces a trade-off between hope and despair. Cost is legible in her emotional shift ("tapping relief"), though "periodically eternal" framing slightly abstracts the pressure before the revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from coral resilience and atlas reassembly, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "disappearance" into regeneration without stating a moral, though "periodic eternal truth" risks abstraction in one mid-story reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via marine scientist’s tactile focus (tapping, ink-faded atlas) and rhythmic control under pressure. Consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping, but minor register drift in "periodic eternal truth" reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("bleaching events recurring like clockwork" avoids cliché through context). Slight figurative muddle in "eternal cycles—death blooming into barren eternity," but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief and scientific hope via coral migration shifts. Specific marine details ("hydrophone recordings of vanished sea songs") transform tropes, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
