<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elara's dual role as vessel/destroyer of echoes, but "richly perceptive" remains label-heavy without sufficient embodied tradeoffs during climax pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("voice now carried softer, sad tone"), though nexus rules require slight inference at climax; orientation anchors by 112 words avoid penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering seashell constrains all key choices and charges the final image ("faint reed-whisper"), transforming from relic to ritual tool while avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency—her singing actively unravels webs—but the Echo Weavers' threat lacks tactical escalation; cost ("softer, sadder tone") legibly forecloses her former sonic identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image ("wondered if her own echo lingered") resonates as non-literal answer to "why some echo," avoiding moralizing while reweighting the universe's song as both prison and liberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catching nuances others dismissed") persists under pressure; lyrical compression ("serpentine nexus under starlight") taught early pays off in closure's "faint reed-whisper" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "melancholy winds" recurrence evolves meaningfully from lament to stilled silence. Minor register drift in "method of progressive disclosure" (Q9F) slightly dulls mid-beat propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics and grief transforms "echo" trope; "weaving emotional resonances" feels inevitable yet unexpected. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
