<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but contradictory impulses under pressure lack development; eruption of emotions feels unearned without visible struggle prior to climax. "Bonds discovered not in gentle touch" abstracts emotion with diagnostic phrasing that violates embodied emotion standards.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (shattered mirrors, "disquieting peace"), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the emotional eruption arises externally rather than from Elias's choices. Orientation anchors early but pressure doesn't tighten meaningfully under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gallery functions as active micro-setting: sloping floors constrain movement, mirrors supply resources for weaving, and debris charges final image. "Sinew thread" as recurring object constrains choices (weaving patterns) and embodies theme, though "unyielding weave of human ties" slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, but escalation remains passive—Elias weaves without tactical adaptation as pressure mounts. No visible price paid during weaving; "growing tremor" lacks causal link to choices. Band guardrail fails: no narrowing of options before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Final image ("fevered sinew of the soul") offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from sinew thread's evolution, though "rational enchantment" remains underdeveloped as active constraint. Avoids thematic echo in critical final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veins under pale skin," "dormant serpent") and rhythmic control shine under pressure; short phrases during eruption accelerate pace. Zero head-hopping, with reflection anchored to sinew thread's tactile cues. Elision of backstory taught early via "memories began to alter."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; high density with propulsion ("Mirrors cracked in spiderweb fissures"). Minor loop: "unsettling calm" repeats without evolution, and "realistically imaginary" feels forced. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though reflection beats show slight synonym churn ("alter/shift/morph").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms gallery tropes through specific sinew-weaving mechanics and "fevered sinew" resolution. Emotional truth avoids templates, but "rational enchantment" premise leans generic. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though gallery setting lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
