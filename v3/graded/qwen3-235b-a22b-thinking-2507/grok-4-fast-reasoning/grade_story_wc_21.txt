<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction (truth vs sanity) shown through embodied choices like beach debris arrangement; activist's parallel desperation deepens motivation. Lacks fully simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak beats, slightly flattening micro-choices under maximum pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: beach debris parley crystallizes options with visceral cost ("soaked and shivering"), the zeppelin's shadow making conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative lens holds throughout with retrocognitive tightening; orientation anchors within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting charging the final image—its "polished night" surface directly enables the debris parley. Body (sifting silt) constrains the climax choice, though some coastal details verge on ornamental ("sand whipping her face").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: each retrocognitive loop raises cost (sanity unraveling), culminating in the visceral beach parley demand. Cost is unmistakable in her physical state and the diary's "latent energy," reweighting truth's price under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the debris arrangement offers non-literal answer to "how truth survives oppression," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the activist's sunken diary into a living archive, with "mending fractured archive" grounded in concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("her life a archive of forgotten injustices") and rhythmic control under pressure ("reverie burned, searing her thoughts"). Zero head-hopping; elision of activist's backstory taught early via letters and paid off in the lagoon vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold—"decrypting in her retrocognitive grip" does triple duty—but minor artifacts like "tension of truth coiled like a spring" slightly blur clarity in a high-pressure beat. Final line ("renewed purpose skyward") propels closure perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "retrocognitive trap" transforms archival work into visceral stakes, with beach debris parley feeling inevitable yet revelatory. Risks lyrical structure without gimmickry, committing fully to the premise's emotional logic from letters to lagoon.</comment>
