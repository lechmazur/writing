<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in obituary craft ("map fragile boundaries") shows contradictory impulses; unraveling thread as micro-choice reveals value hierarchy with cost (stranded). Epiphany earned through tactile action but slightly over-articulated in final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "healing's geography lay not in distant lands" crystallizes stance with felt cost (stranded isolation). Accumulative lens holds through density build to thread-fraying moment; orientation anchored by "last ship sailed" within 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carpet weft thread functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (unraveling) and charges final image (frayed thread mirroring "delicate balance"). Sensory hierarchy perfectly filtered through Elias' elegist lens—decaying petals, ink-stained journals—not tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' writing act: "stranded after last vessel sailed" creates immediate cost that alters tactics (using thread as quill). Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds as obituary draft transforms "explained absences" into tangible geography; cost legible in "garden's shadows embracing him like old friends."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: carpet thread reweights from relic to "talisman," then to frayed symbol of healing's fragility. Final image ("thread now frayed") offers non-literal answer to "geography of healing" without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through Liora's "cartographer of scars" metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ink-stained journals," "weft threads binding warp of history" reveal elegist's mind. Rhythmic control under pressure via sentence variation ("He was Elias..."; "Seating himself..."). No head-hopping; reflection anchored to carpet thread's texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("lonesome splendor where golden foliage drifted like forgotten memories") slightly dulls momentum, but no loops/scaffold. Final line ("one thread at a time") delivers crystalline propulsion. Figurative density justified by voice, though "vivid decay" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obituaries for the living premise transformed through specific elegist mechanics ("weft of hidden palace"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—stranded traveler's writing becomes lifeline—without gimmickry. Avoids safety middle via morally ambiguous healing ("splendor bloomed in solitude").</comment>
