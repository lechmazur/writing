<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in Elara’s drive to preserve echoes versus risking everything to expose truth; embodied emotion in "heart quickened" and hesitation before lying elevates beyond label-only feelings. Micro-choices under pressure (fabricating audit log) reveal hierarchy of values but secondary pressure lacks another character to deepen conflict stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "lied once more... corporation's gaze was ever watchful" crystallizes the cost of her choice with undeniable pressure. Drive lens (Causal) holds from anomaly discovery to final archival act, though the corporate threat remains slightly off-page at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The social network archive functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (corporate protocols) and charges the final image—Elara secretly archiving the patch in the "digital mausoleum" reweights the environment’s purpose. Sensory details like "dim glow of her cubicle" and "server halls hummed" reflect urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly when Elara fabricates the audit log to bypass protocols, narrowing options to truth or safety. Cost is legible in her moral compromise ("lied once more") and implied danger, though the corporation’s active threat lacks visceral on-page manifestation during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of digital absence/reclamation emerges through concrete particulars: deleted files migrating to shadow servers, the mission patch’s scorched emblem. Final image ("absence was never truly final") reweights the premise non-literally without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through embodied discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brightly attentive eyes scanning patterns others overlooked" and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., accelerating syntax during investigation). Voice modulates from lyrical ("echo of forgotten songs") to taut ("She fabricated a routine audit log") without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("digital mausoleum where profiles of the long-disconnected lingered like ghosts") with zero scaffold or loops. Final line’s cadence shift ("numbers faded... but their rhythm lingered") delivers propulsion, though "sensed absence" slightly edges toward thematic label in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms corporate espionage trope through the fresh lens of digital archiving, with emotionally specific stakes in Elara’s quiet rebellion. The "shadow servers" concept synthesizes tech and human truth-seeking organically, avoiding safety-hedging by embracing moral ambiguity in her compromise.</comment>
