<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation for sideways time is clear and embodied in action (breath fogging viewport, lever pull), but lacks contradictory impulses; Jax's "obliging" trait isn't tested under pressure, reducing earned change. Emotional progression remains overly rational without layered irrationality during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (nexus flare crystallizes temporal proof with felt cost in the "icy warmth" surge), but cost legibility falters—the surge reads as validation, not sacrifice. Orientation anchors (station/symbiotes) land cleanly by paragraph 2, avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint: the magnetic nexus's zero-g suspension and bio-luminescent panels directly enable the holographic experiment. Sensory details ("breath fogging the viewport," "velvet indigo") filter through Elara's urgency, charging the final image with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving sideways time) tightens via the lever action, but escalation lacks visible cost—Jax's risk of destabilization is acknowledged but not paid. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, yet the price remains conceptual rather than altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (wingbeat influencing "tomorrow" pose), avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights time's flow without stating a thesis, but secondary conflicts (isolation, risk) aren't woven deeply enough to achieve 9+ resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Elara's scientific precision ("virtual lattice to map time's paths") vs. Jax's mechanical pragmatism ("Doc," lever mechanics). Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during the flare ("Elara gasped, tracing...")—with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in climax beats ("Jax maneuvered... fingers hovering"), but overwriting in atmospheric setup ("frost-laced world... delicate balance of cryogenic chill") risks density penalties. No loops or scaffold in closure, though "ethereal grids" borders on stock metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of xenobiology and temporal physics avoids genre clichés; the "sideways time" premise transforms through symbiote behavior. Risk-taking (Accumulative/Textural lens) heightens stakes, but emotional specificity lacks the 9+ "inevitable in hindsight" depth.</comment>
