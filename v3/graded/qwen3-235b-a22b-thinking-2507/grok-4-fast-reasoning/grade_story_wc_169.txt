<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete through tidal actions and equation-making, but lacks contradictory impulses—Elara’s resolve remains unwavering without irrational doubt or self-deception under pressure, missing the 9+ requirement for earned change via causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing mandala reweights hope as adaptive, not fixed, with felt cost in the city’s fragility; Accumulative lens holds via pattern accumulation, though the reflection on the city’s fall slightly exceeds BRR ceiling without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The altitude gauge constrains every choice—from measuring tides to anchoring equations—and charges the final image as a "reborn" conduit, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making the tool indispensable to closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("hope as calculus") deepen through trial balloons that burst and return with data, narrowing options via micro-choices, but the cost remains abstract—no visceral loss like a sacrificed resource or time—keeping escalation just below the 8.8-band requirement for unmistakable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tide-gauge equation, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights hope as "adaptive" without stating a moral, but the equation’s literal inscription risks thematic echo, narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tidal logic and equation-weaving; rhythm modulates from serene ("smooth, undulating forms") to urgent ("heart quickened in serene upheaval"), with no head-hopping, though "lucidly watchful" repetition borders on scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts and high density, but paraphrase loops in "serene upheaval" descriptions ("calm surfaces hiding turbulent undercurrents... still pools that masked swirling eddies") trigger −0.4, disallowing 9+ per rubric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of math and grief feels inevitable, with the tide-polished grotto transforming aerial tropes, but the "logical dreamer" archetype lacks sufficient risk-taking to breach 8.8 without a hairline slip in emotional complexity.</comment>
