<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "regally unpretentious" trait stated but never tested through meaningful choices with visible cost. Interiority remains observational rather than revealing conflicting drives during pivotal moments like the confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt persists past 120 words ("across the pause of shifting constellations" fails to anchor time concretely), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise) lands cleanly with conceptual cost as Varak dissolves into "autumn leaves," but delayed temporal grounding caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Library setting functions as vivid backdrop but never constrains choices or supplies critical resources; dust motes and ethereal light enhance atmosphere yet remain decorative. Fails 9+ gate as no recurring object/body/tool shapes tactics or charges the final image despite strong sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstractly cosmic ("fractured balance of the cosmos") without visceral on-page manifestation; Varak's threat lacks tangible escalation. Protagonist agency drives pressure through message proliferation, but cost isn't felt until climax, limiting escalation depth under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "drift" motif reweighted by final dissolution image ("autumn leaves on unseen wind"), avoiding moralizing. Resonant non-literal answer to central question (truths adrift revealing lies) charges closure without abstraction, though cosmic stakes slightly dilute emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: ink "glistening like a captured night," constellations "hung suspended." Rhythmic control under pressure evident in confrontation's clipped sentences ("Confronted... he snarled"). No head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from lyrical to urgent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold detected ("her frame woven from earth's deepest iron veins, yet her demeanor remained regally unpretentious") creates slight paraphrase loop. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final line ("timeless peace restored in quiet victory") delivers propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of titan-as-librarian and "rune of drift" concept transforms familiar usurper trope. Emotional truth in quiet victory avoids generic templates, though cosmic stakes slightly dilute human-scale complexity. Risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
