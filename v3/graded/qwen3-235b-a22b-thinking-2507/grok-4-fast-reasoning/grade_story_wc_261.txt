<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("believing true healing demanded") rather than embodied contradiction; diagnostic label "accidentally telepathic" triggers -0.4 penalty despite strong micro-choices like refilling the hourglass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (opal vision reconfigures scar's meaning with tears as cost), but the "unbroken hush" resolution lacks sufficient grit for higher band; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tower functions as micro-setting: quartz chamber constrains choice, and frosted hourglass charges final image when thawed; "dewy greens" and "scrape of metal" reflect urgency but spatial choreography of tunneling lacks tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: coffee-ring reading → hearing ferns → digging; cost ("sweat beaded," emotional tears) visibly alters tactics, with opal discovery reweighting "displaced miracle" into earned meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from scar/opal motifs; final line ("story now etched in her soul") avoids moralizing while recharging "displaced miracle" with conceptual cost, though "miracle rerouted" edges near thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("verdant voices leaking like roots") shines, but uniform "hush" lexicon dilutes pressure modulation; psychic distance stays controlled despite dense lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but minor scaffold ("she had always been accidentally telepathic") and near-redundant "profound, unbroken" hush phrasing prevent 9.0; sentence rhythm varies purposefully through digging sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy with horticulture avoids tropes, but "displaced miracle" risks abstraction; specificity of coffee-ring divination and quartz chamber elevates premise beyond safety middle.</comment>
