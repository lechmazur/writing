<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "confidently uncertain" and physicalized regret ("unbending the pen symbolized her resolve"), but brother's off-page status limits relationship crucible. Final choice earned through causal buildup to editing the log, with cost visible in the fragile bent nib.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the nib bending slightly... reminder of fragility" crystallizes conceptual cost under Causal lens. Orientation anchors ("forsaken station caught in gravitational anomaly") by line 3 avoid penalties; lens inferred by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (floating movements, quantum-flux ink) and charges final image ("cradle rather than cage"). Pen's physicality ("curved like quasar spirals") directly shapes tactics during unbending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: log-editing decision forecloses isolation path with visible cost (fragile timeline). Escalation via pen activation → editing → vision sequence narrows options under Causal lens; coincidence never resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete action: "wrong seeds could yield unexpected harvests" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image charges thematic resonance by transforming "cage" to "cradle" with conceptual cost of temporal fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("anomaly's hum felt like a lullaby") modulates rhythm under pressure; "gravity tugged playfully" shows controlled psychic distance. Zero head-hopping; syntax tightens during editing ("Unbending... required focus").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ethereal ink materialized from quantum flux" achieves high density without muddle. Final beat ("nib bending slightly") delivers closure image with crystalline clarity; no artifacts in peak pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through "contingent relationships" mechanics. Fresh angle: redemption via delicate causal tweaks rather than brute-force edits. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry (cosmic scale + intimate regret).</comment>
