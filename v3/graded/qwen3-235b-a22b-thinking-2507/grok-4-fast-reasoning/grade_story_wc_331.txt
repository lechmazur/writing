<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete actions (collecting footnotes, tracing patterns) and embodied emotion (heart racing at reawakened visions), avoiding therapy-speak. Final choice to carry echoes earns closure through prior causality—scarf handling shifts from curiosity to sacred duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara folding the scarf crystallizes her shift from seeker to vessel, with felt cost in "quest not ended but enriched." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each hyperbolic tiling deepens pressure until the warp in air reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Scientific Poetry Library’s non-Euclidean acoustics and silk scarf constrain choices: geometry method requires curved space, scarf’s warmth charges the final image. Sensory details ("ripples mimicking waves on a non-Euclidean sea") reflect urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when patrons sense the warp but dismiss it—a live option (sharing the vision) foreclosed by their obliviousness, raising cost of solitude. Escalation is pure Accumulative: density builds via hexagon sketches until analog memories stir, reweighting "where stories live."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scarf’s transformation: "analog weave connecting minds" crystallizes in the final image of Elara carrying echoes, rejecting digital isolation without moralizing. No abstraction—wisdom earned via silk’s pulse and hyperbolic garden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "equations danced with metaphors" filters setting through Elara’s poetic-scientific lens. Voice modulates under pressure—lyrical cadence accelerates during reawakening ("threads humming"), avoiding uniformity. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion excels ("frayed like half-remembered dream" → "silk catching lamplight in ripples"), but "cosmic lyre" metaphor slightly muddles the peak beat. No loops; strategic density in "hyperbolic realm within the library’s core" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ingenuity lies in fusing hyperbolic geometry with analog memory—a fresh angle where math becomes ritual. The library’s "soul’s geometry" premise transforms tropes through specific stakes (patrons’ obliviousness as cost), resisting generic abstraction.</comment>
