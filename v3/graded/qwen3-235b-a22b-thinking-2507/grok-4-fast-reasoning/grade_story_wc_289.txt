<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("heart felt adrift") rather than embodied; "thread connecting all things" diagnosis violates Q1 anti-pattern rule. Strength: micro-choice of opening the letter reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost ("no longer adrift"), but "motivation fulfilled" phrasing lacks visible behavioral change. Strength: Accumulative lens holds through thrush-twig revelation; orientation clear by 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lotus temple/lily pond functions as micro-setting: pond surface reflects closure image, twigs constrain choice. Strength: "water-dappled envelope" and "slick stone paths" charge final reconnection with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Liora's letter (one tightening), but "rejoin the circle" lacks concrete trade-off. Strength: Isolation-to-connection cost crystallizes in "tears blurred the prismatic quiet" with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Grand thread" metaphor risks thematic echo but avoids moralizing via concrete images (thrush feathers, sealed letters). Weakness: "binding the world in quiet unity" edges toward abstraction without sufficient particulate grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "refracted sunlight into soft rainbows" filters world through Elara's romantic profession. Zero register drift; lyrical compression taught early ("prismatic quiet") and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn: "unfurling" and "uncoiling" describe spiral redundantly. Strength: Zero loops in climax; "envelope clutched like a talisman" achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ghostwriter" trope with public art installation. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "whimsical inevitable" phrasing leans cliché.</comment>
