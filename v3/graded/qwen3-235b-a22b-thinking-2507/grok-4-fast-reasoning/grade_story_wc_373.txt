<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect her father is concrete and drives her three thwart attempts, but "curiously steadfast" remains told rather than shown through irreversible choice; micro-choices reveal hierarchy (fob as collateral) yet emotional contradiction feels underdeveloped during high-stakes flare grab.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Elara captures the "audible gasp" amid patrol horns—reconfiguring trust's fragility with visible cost—but phonograph detail ("whispered into hidden phonograph") feels tacked-on, momentarily breaking causality in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rotting pier’s "comforting unease" constrains every choice (e.g., fog enabling stealth, market rhythm masking ploys) and charges the final image as "unease fading into morning’s promise," with sensory details like "spilled grog" directly altering tactics during the flare snatch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency-driven false starts (rival plot escalation), culminating in the flare-thwart with undeniable cost—trust fractures audibly—yet the patrols' arrival risks coincidental resolution despite their prior foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fragile trust emerges implicitly through concrete actions (fob as truce symbol, gasp of betrayal), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "comforting unease" as earned solace after cost, resonating without stating the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("pier’s creaks were a lullaby for outlaws"), with rhythmic control tightening under stress ("Breath shallow, she initiated..."), though "curiously steadfast" slightly disrupts voice consistency during the crone encounter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold weakens momentum: "false start" phrasing repeats identically for three attempts, and "comforting unease" becomes a looped motif; strong verbs ("lunged, snatching") propel climax but final paragraph’s abstraction ("path cleared by vigil") dulls closure’s edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "sound of trust breaking" motivation transforms smuggling trope through specific, grounded details (phonograph metaphor, watch fob history), though the moonshine runner frame risks genre familiarity without its precise sensory execution.</comment>
