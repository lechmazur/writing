<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "heart raced" is label-only feeling during critical borrowing moment. Embodied emotion present elsewhere but pivotal choice lacks simultaneous conflicting drives required for 8.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "journey lingered, unresolved yet complete" crystallizes cost of borrowed time with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through cadence density shift without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canal system functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (borrowing time at junction), but "rooftop" specificity doesn't charge final image. Final "paddling back" lacks environmental constraint on legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via cadence escalation ("hummed louder... vibrating through stones"), but borrowing time lacks visible tactical cost during execution. "Borrowed time tugged" is felt but doesn't alter her immediate actions per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through echo-birthing imagery without moralizing, but "sculpted her own timeless legacy" edges toward thematic echo. Final image reweights echoes as legacy rather than birthplace, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("illustrator's eye cataloging swirling patterns"), but "unresolved tension fueling her action" uses abstract phrasing inconsistent with her sensory POV during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but "fragile and luminous, like half-formed illustrations begging for completion" risks overwriting. Strong propulsion otherwise; "waters parted like curtains" earns textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-sculpting giant and echo-birthing, but "place where echoes are born" leans trope-adjacent. Specificity saved by solidified echoes "twisting in perpetual half-resolve" and illustrator lens.</comment>
