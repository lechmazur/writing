<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in anxiety-to-calm shift, but emotional calibration feels too precise (112→72 bpm) without visible struggle; blood-drawing shard micro-choice reveals value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (fading ink patterns = ephemeral solution), but scanner connection happens off-page, breaking causality at the climax beat where defragmentation mechanics should anchor the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal walls and porcelain shard function as micro-setting that constrains choices (shard guides ink flow) and charges the final image ("relic of her trial"); snow isolation supplies essential resources (scanner, radio) altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through ink patterns and heartbeat count, but "cost everything" backstory remains abstract; no dramatized specific loss makes the emotional cost feel unearned despite strong escalation toward defragmentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: ink's "ephemeral patterns" becoming interface shows transience enabling connection; no moralizing, and final "solace bloomed eternal" reweights "midnight solace" opening with undeniable conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (data archivist sees "vortices of regret" in ink), but "midnight solace wrapped around her" opener has purple prose drift; voice modulates well under stress except "ephemeral patterns" feels academically jarring during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in shattering-cup scene ("fragments" x4) but ink description ("danced like whispers from the void") delivers high density; final line's "bloomed" purposefully echoes ink's "bloomed across floor" for closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Digital ghost counting heartbeats transforms trope through data-archivist lens; ink defragmentation risks sentimentality but avoids it via concrete mechanics and temporary solution (fading patterns), heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
