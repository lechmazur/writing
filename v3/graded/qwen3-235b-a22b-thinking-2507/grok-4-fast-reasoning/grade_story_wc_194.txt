<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("unspoken questions," "furrow in brow") without visceral embodiment; motivation clear but emotional contradiction lacks concrete physicality during pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost ("dissolve remaining estates"), but cost proof is diffuse—"wave that stood eternally" obscures precise moment of felt sacrifice despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sepia room constrains choices: Persian rugs muffle footsteps enabling discovery, loose panel in shelves supplies critical diary—micro-setting directly charges final image as Elias "steps into destiny" amid golden shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (dynasty collapse) tighten through Elias's agency finding diary, but escalation lacks tangible pressure—standing waves device functions as plot convenience rather than earned constraint altering tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of winding gramophone reweights crank handle as "key to lock and unlock," offering resonant answer to bloodline legitimacy without moralizing; liberation theme emerges through standing waves' ancestral echoes, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("leather sighing under weight," "brass horn curved like forgotten trumpet"), but repetitive "Elias" openings in middle section slightly erode rhythmic control during high-pressure discovery beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Tarnished but intact" and "whispered secrets to dust motes" flirt with cliché; otherwise, sentence variation ("He mused deeper... visions of boardroom betrayals") sustains propulsion without scaffold in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Standing waves as truth-carrier transforms "dynasty ender" trope through sensory specificity, but birthright revelation lacks fresh moral calculus—core premise remains derivative despite elegant synthesis with sepia-toned atmosphere.</comment>
