<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena’s embodied regret (tracing charred letter’s rough texture) and contradictory impulses (rootedness vs. longing) feel authentic; Liam’s nomadic conflict lacks sufficient micro-choices to elevate beyond catalyst role, preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Elena’s "heart lighter with understanding" crystallizes her renunciation of isolation, with visible cost in the charred letter’s survival—pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens through autumn’s cyclical decay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and charred letter constrain choices (shelter, moonlight examination) and charge closure; decaying foliage’s scent directly mirrors Elena’s emotional state while supplying the letter’s physical context—exceeds 9+ gate via recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through Elena’s agency—her "rediscover" reframes Liam’s pain via vine metaphors—narrowing options to acceptance; cost is legible in "tension in his shoulders easing," though Liam’s arrival slightly edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "vines twisting toward the sun" reweights "destined mismatches" without moralizing; final sketch crystallizes renewal through action, avoiding abstraction—no thematic echo, only earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fields whispering secrets," "amber embrace") shines, but "passionate subtlety" descriptor and Liam’s over-articulated "nomadic spirit" clash with stress-induced diction, narrowly missing 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "slow pour of aged wine" slightly overwrites momentum in one beat, but "earthly scent of decaying foliage" integrates atmosphere with action—propulsion flawless except minor figurative muddle in high-pressure dialogue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "stranded traveler" trope via vineyard-specific emotional labor; letter fragment’s evolution from regret to wisdom feels inevitable. Risk in quiet closure heightens stakes, but "intersubjective understanding" phrasing lacks freshness.</comment>
