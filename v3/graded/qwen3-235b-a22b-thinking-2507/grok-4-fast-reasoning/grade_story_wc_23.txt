<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in lunar-fluctuating clarity vs. persistent action; micro-choices like dialing cryptic calls under doubt earn endurance. Near-9.0 deduction: reflection on wife's hands borders on summary but pivots to tactile grounding with censer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly—"clarity dimmed, but calls persisted" crystallizes cost of fluctuating mind against enduring work. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through call sequences; cost proof solid in "waning to new" pressure shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Patina bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining choices during doubt ("clutched... tracing etched waves") and charging closure's "cool bronze promise." Sensory economy perfect: salt/rust scent anchors, moon phases filter perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: each call deepens network's spiritual impact ("reverse migration of spirits"), with visible cost in mental flux. One decisive deepening suffices; moon-phase tradeoffs ("waning quarter doubt") reweight options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—final image "Loss's map redrawn" reweights geography without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "raw solace" contradictions; "reverse paths etched like constellations" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: nautical lexicon ("reverse migration," "lunar pull") and rhythm modulate with intensity ("raw solace" to "quiet anchor"). No head-hopping; compression taught early ("waxing gibbous, mind tugged") pays off in closure's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("fingers brushed patina bronze censer foot" conveys action, symbol, emotion). Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting: "piecing solace from the night" avoids metaphor muddle. Rhythm varies naturally under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reverse migration" as spiritual return (not physical) transforms tropes. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; specificity of censer foot and moon phases passes transformation test. Near-9.0 deduction: safety hedging in "families arrived... tentative hope" softens risk.</comment>
