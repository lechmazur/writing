<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite clear motivation; "strangely honest" is stated but lacks embodied contradiction in pivotal consecration moment where micro-choices should reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (wisdom preserved), but the felt cost lacks visceral anchoring; the prophet's legacy "spark" remains external to Elar's personal stakes at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dunes and pavilion function as micro-setting that charges closure ("fraction wiser" reweights the whisperfield calm), though kinetic parapet's physical constraints could deepen tactical choices earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving echo) are clear and escalate through clearings, but pressure lacks meaningful deepening; the threat of dissolution feels atmospheric rather than concretely tested against Elar's vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars until final line’s "world felt a fraction wiser" – overt thematic echo that states the moral, violating organic emergence and triggering Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peripheral awareness," sensory selectivity) shines, but repeated "strangely honest" phrasing creates minor voice convergence under emotional peak during consecration rite.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "murmurs welcoming him like old confidants" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise, lyrical density and rhythmic control serve Accumulative pressure without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of desert mysticism and line-walking trope, but kinetic parapet concept leans on familiar "ancient buried power" archetype without transformative specificity in execution.</comment>
