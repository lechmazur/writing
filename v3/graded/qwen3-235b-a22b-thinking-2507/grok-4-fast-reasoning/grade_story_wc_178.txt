<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("encrypted devotion decrypted itself") dominates climax without embodied cost; motivation lacks contradictory impulses under pressure despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: unclear setting beyond 120 words with no disorientation payoff; closure lacks visible cost—Elias's "enrichment" feels consequence-free despite covenant demands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid "dusky harmony" anchors atmosphere but micro-setting (tile) fails to constrain choices; palace details remain ornamental postures without affecting tactics or closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No escalation—Elias faces zero opposition while sealing covenant; stakes remain abstract ("unseen architect") with no tangible cost or narrowing options despite high-pressure premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of devotion emerges through tile/star alignment but final line's "quiet triumph" states moral directly, violating earned resonance; ambiguity feels unearned without concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in astronomical details, but "empirically ironic" repetitions flatten voice; POV leaks into cosmic entities' perspective during uncloaking beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops ("frugal/thrifty" echoes) and filter-verb stacks during discovery beat; "empirically ironic" label churn dulls closure image with redundant abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Transforms magic square trope through Babylonian context but "encrypted devotion" feels like a writing prompt; emotional specificity lacks freshness in astronomer's solitary epiphany.</comment>
