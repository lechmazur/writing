<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in chess metaphors ("sifting regret from redemption"), but royal court backstory lacks embodied cost; "betrayal he could never fully erase" remains label-heavy without visceral flashbacks during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with the thawing villager's eye-twitch, yet the decoded tapestry's mechanics feel slightly convenient; thunder's recurrence provides solid cadence shifts but backstory exceeds BRR 30% ceiling without sufficient micro-choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth walls "etching chess-like patterns" brilliantly constrain navigation choices, though time-frozen village leans on statue clichés ("baker mid-flour toss"); tapestry's frayed threads charge the climax but initial setting lacks olfactory/tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize perfectly through "fierce repose" tension between guilt and absolution; thunder lulls tighten decisions organically ("lull stretching taut"), with the eye-twitch cost unmistakable—no coincidences resolve conflict, only Elias's decoded choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "forgiveness as the ultimate strategy" resonates via the mirror scene without moralizing; final image of "fidgets now laced with peace" recharges chess motifs non-literally while embracing complexity of self-betrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chess-centric diction ("winnowing false paths"), but adjacent filter-verb stacks ("Elias turned his gaze... leaned closer") disrupt immediacy; rhythmic control under pressure otherwise exemplary with taught patterned elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("winnowing false paths from true ones, sifting regret from redemption") slightly dulls momentum; otherwise impeccable propulsion with platinum's "merciless precision" crystallizing Elias's state—zero scaffold in high-pressure labyrinth sequences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-freeze trope via chess tutor lens and platinum's strategic constraints; emotional specificity in "tutor who had once advised ruin" avoids generic guilt, though thunder motif borders on predictable atmospheric device without fresh inflection.</comment>
