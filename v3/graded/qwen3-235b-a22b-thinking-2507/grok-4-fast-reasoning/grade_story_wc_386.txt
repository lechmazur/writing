<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation to "salvage purity" is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice feels earned though internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in high-pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: shrine warming and snow globe reforming crystallize emotional cost under Accumulative lens, though cost feels slightly under-embodied in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacier shrine constrains every action (candle arrangement, ice windows) and directly charges closure via the reforming snowflake—environment shapes tactics and final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging purity vs. suppressed affections) deepens through cameo analysis, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara receives visions rather than actively wrestling with choices that narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "unspoken bonds" revelation avoids moralizing, with the reforming snowflake offering resonant, non-literal answer to the purity question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature (ice-carved details, spectral focus), but "borrowed starlight" repetition risks thematic echo; rhythm modulates effectively under pressure despite two slightly overwrought phrases.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density, though "ethereal chill" and "spectral remnants" border on cliché; final image achieves crystalline clarity without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms Arctic exploration tropes via dream cameos and melted snow globe; emotional specificity in midshipman’s fire scene creates fresh inflection that grows from prior particulars.</comment>
