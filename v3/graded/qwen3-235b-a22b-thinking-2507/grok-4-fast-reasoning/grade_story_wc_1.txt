<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "artist to fugitive" shift; embodied "hands trembling" avoids therapy-speak. "Purpose in pauses" phrasing risks abstraction but earns resonance through concrete frost-retracing. Final choice forecloses isolation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: frost patterns accumulate pressure toward Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes in "art that resonated like the land itself" with conceptual price of innocence lost. Orientation clear by 100 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon actively constrains choices—frost reveals paths, stars echo resolve. Micro-setting (frost patterns) charges final image and alters tactics twice. "Translucent canvas" metaphor avoids cliché through artist’s POV filtration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single stake (expose smugglers) deepens via frost-retracing; pressure tightens as ledger aligns with routes. Cost is conceptual (art weaponized) but legible in "spark for luminous creations." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass/frost interplay; "pauses transform" reframes isolation without moralizing. Final image reweights "voids of deeper intent" into purposeful silences. Avoids thematic echo despite "purpose" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("artist’s eye") modulates rhythm under stress; "drifting resonance" refrain taught early. Elevated diction fits POV but "luminous glass sculptures" slightly overwrites. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("fragile silica/beacons of quiet wonder") but high density in frost-retracing beat. Final line ("steady and unyielding") avoids cliché through concrete charge. No closure-dulling artifacts; rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glass artist’s skills repurposed for investigation via frost patterns. Avoids eco-activism tropes through specific "scorched testament" mechanics. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
