<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (artistic purity vs truth-seeking duty) drive every choice; Kael's lie creates immediate embodied conflict as leaves wilt, proving motivation through action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise—vibrant leaves ready to inscribe recovered conversations—carries undeniable conceptual cost; causal chain holds from map discovery to vault revelation with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting actively constrains choices (toxic sky forcing indoor art, humidity affecting leaf preservation); gilded leaves charge the final image but occupational details lack deeper integration with conflict mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from personal quest (finding lost words) to communal survival (truth irrigating souls); Kael's lie forces immediate trade-off where confronting dishonesty becomes necessary for vault access.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (child's laugh at poison sky), avoiding moralizing; final image of vibrant leaves reweights "candor in small moments" as non-literal solution without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("dust motes danced in beam of lantern"), but slight register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" momentarily distances voice during high-pressure vault discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cracked earth" to "crystalline resonators" motif charges closure; only minor deduction for "motivation sharpening" abstraction where embodied detail would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy-as-truth-detector in water-scarcity dystopia avoids tropes; emotional specificity in farmer's plea/child's laugh grounds universals without generic abstraction.</comment>
