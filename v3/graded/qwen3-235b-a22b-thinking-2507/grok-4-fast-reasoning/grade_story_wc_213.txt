<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (duty vs intuition) but stress embodiment lacks visceral texture during climax; "humble duty transformed" risks slight abstraction despite strong micro-choices like testing the rope's restored strength.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: bell toll at midnight forecloses siren use with felt cost ("No siren needed tonight"), the mountain's "approval" crystallizing stakes under Accumulative lens; orientation anchored in opening 37 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary actively constrains choices (rope mending in chill, sound propagation), bell rope as micro-setting charges closure; minor deduction for "tattered flag" cliché amid otherwise purposeful sensory hierarchy reflecting Elias's meteorological focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving quiet vs warning) signaled early, deepens via microclimate anomalies; pressure accumulates but lacks visceral escalation—warmer air feels atmospheric rather than threatening, softening the cost of bypassing protocol.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: bell's "call to attend" versus mechanical noise, microclimates as subtle warnings; final image reweights "listening" without moralizing, though "bastion of quiet vigilance" edges toward slight sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("patient's eye," tracking microclimates) creates rhythmic control; voice modulates perfectly under stress (shorter sentences during tolling); no head-hopping, tense stability anchors Accumulative lens through atmospheric shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("wind howling through arrow-slit windows" does triple duty); minor deduction for near-cliché "glue dried true" saved by context; final line avoids thematic echo through concrete action ("listening prevailed over noise" earned by toll).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "quiet sentinel" trope via meteorological specificity; microclimate tracking method feels fresh, though solstice hush borders on familiar pastoral. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for warning story) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
