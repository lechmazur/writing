<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; withdrawal-to-purpose shift lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses despite embodied "shivering bliss" during unsnapping. Final allegiance feels earned but micro-choices don't reveal layered value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (open breastplate = vulnerability) under Accumulative lens; reality shifts escalate density to stabilize orchard. Final image reconfigures "endless night" from isolation to promise without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains choice via pulsing fruits and luminescent soil; "crystalline leaves" and unsnapped clasp charge final image. Sensory details reflect urgency (e.g., "vines twisting into impossible geometries" during climax).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: unsnapping armor narrows options (solitude vs. potential) with felt cost. "Shifting voids" pressure coheres, but "reclaimed bliss" slightly over-smooths emotional progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through marionette patterns reweighted as life-affirming; final "orchestrate the orchard's grand performance" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "allegiance" borders on concept statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("armor whispered against crystalline leaves") with rhythmic control during reality shifts. Prose modulates syntax under pressure ("vines twisting into impossible geometries" compresses diction organically).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "shivering bliss" evolves meaningfully across beats. Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing, but "threads of possibility snaring the air" maintains textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alchemy-marionette fusion feels fresh; "factually mystical" avoids trope via concrete constraint (fruits stabilize through patterns). Derivative knight archetype mitigated by specific withdrawal-to-weaver arc and risk-taking structure.</comment>
