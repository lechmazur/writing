<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("grime from his hands," "urge to pierce arboreal gaze"), but Elias' closure choice—repairing the sextant via dream-mapping—lacks sufficient causal motivation; the epiphany about "quantified sorrows" feels slightly unearned without deeper prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (sextant healed, trees' visions revealed), with conceptual cost legible in "losses etched in light-years of regret," but the Accumulative/Textural lens wavers slightly as dream-mapping mechanics remain abstract, weakening pressure escalation at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sextant—recurring object—constrains choices and charges the final image (fractures sealing via lunar glow, sighted visions of astronomers); its tactile repair and transformation embody the theme, fulfilling the 9+ gate through purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("what did trees witness?") tighten meaningfully at the pin-drop moment, narrowing options to dream-mapping the sextant, but Elias' agency in escalation feels passive; the storm's easing softens the cost, diluting the conceptual weight of "quantified sorrow."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sextant's tally marks and stellar parallax imagery, with the final vision of "constellations of resilience" offering non-literal resolution, yet "quantified sorrow" leans abstract without deeper integration into Elias' physical choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("moonlight pooled like spilled mercury," dream-maps "curving like tree branches"), and rhythmic control intensifies under pressure; no head-hopping, though minor register drift occurs in "attribute of forgotten lore."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, high density ("lunar glow mended what starlight had broken"), but "attribute of forgotten lore" introduces a slight academic register drift in a peak beat, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise immaculate propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "quantified sorrow" with labyrinth maintenance and dream-mapping feels fresh, yet the premise risks derivative "enchanted object" tropes; specificity in Elias' tactile repair and tree visions elevates it beyond mere archetype.</comment>
