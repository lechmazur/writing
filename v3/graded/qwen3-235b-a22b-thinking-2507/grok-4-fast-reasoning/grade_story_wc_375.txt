<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hollow burst" vs. "release") drives choices, but "mnemonically gifted" leans toward label over embodied struggle; micro-choices like recalling the code feel earned though the cost lacks visceral physicality in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sketchbook's discovery crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("luminous grief for lost years"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward the final image of dancing charcoal fingers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystals function as micro-setting that constrains choices (damp walls demand careful handling) and charges the final image ("auroral sorrow across its pages"); selective sensory detail (quartz glow, charcoal smudges) embodies the character's artistic lens throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: memory surge compels lock manipulation, narrowing options from suppression to creation; cost ("crystal shard piercing his heart") is legible but slightly abstract in the peak beat rather than tactile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—sketching the jester reweights "auroral sorrow" without moralizing; the final image ("cave became a womb") offers resonant, non-literal resolution to the central question of creative exile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers smudged with charcoal," "crystals' soft grieving radiance") modulates rhythm under pressure; zero head-hopping and consistent free indirect style elevate voice to lyrical precision without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal artifacts; "bottled visions" slightly risks cliché but is redeemed by context; rhythmic control accelerates during lock manipulation ("clicks echoing like fading laughs") while maintaining propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes "artist's block" trope through specific, grounded choices (mnemonic gift as both curse/key); "auroral sorrow" transforms generic grief into an embodied, irreplaceable tone that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
