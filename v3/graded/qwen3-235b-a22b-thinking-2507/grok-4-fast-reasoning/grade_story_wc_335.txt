<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's embodied conflict (backwards steps vs. mentoring drive) and Lir's visceral fear earn high marks, but his transformation lacks sufficient friction; the "reversible exile" concept isn't tested through prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (Lir's shadow loosening/Elara moving forward) with felt cost, but the "reversible exile" mechanism isn't sufficiently dramatized as active constraint earlier; one tightening suffices for length yet lacks causal weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library setting constrains choice via shard-mirrors and tea rituals; "forgotten air" and "worn stone floor" charge the final image. Micro-setting (tea leaves) directly shapes the climax's tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (reversible exile) signaled early but remain abstract until climax; pressure tightens through tea-leaf analysis, yet Lir's internal conflict lacks concrete escalation beyond initial fear—cost legible but not sufficiently tested pre-closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tea-leaf geometry and mirror shards, but Elara's line "exile defines you? It doesn't" is overt thematic echo; final image avoids moralizing yet "resilience mentored and returned" slightly oversimplifies complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice distinct via Elara's "combative tenderness" lexicon ("soft blade," "fierce gentleness") and stress-induced compression ("heels scraping," "breathing shallowly"); no POV slippage despite reflective backstory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stunning texture ("dust motes danced like forgotten memories") marred by adjacent scaffold loops: "her feet betrayed her... heels scraping... caught herself" uses repetitive stems; filter-verbs dilute high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tea-leaf divination and mirror shards feels inevitable, yet "reversible exile" leans on familiar tropes; specificity of "geometry of loss" elevates beyond abstraction but risks thematic overreach.</comment>
