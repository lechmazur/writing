<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elias’s hesitation at midpoint, but Tomas lacks depth; "uncommonly thoughtful" trait drives micro-choice to verify brother’s release, though brother’s redemption feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: drawer pull transfer crystallizes stakes with visible cost (Elias’s vulnerability), and moon-phase synchronization creates causal pressure narrowing options to one decisive exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storm-worn parapet constrains choices (chains clinking with waves, mist obscuring vision), while the drawer pull charges the final image; sensory details like "brass cool in pocket" heighten urgency without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency when he pauses at midpoint, risking the exchange to verify Tomas’s state; moon-phase protocol creates tangible pressure but secondary "recycling" stake lacks sufficient escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment>Theme emerges organically through drawer pull symbolism, but "recycle mistakes into wisdom" phrasing borders on thematic echo; final image reweights regret as resilience without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist like forgotten regrets," moon as "hesitant witness") modulates with tension; no head-hopping, though Lira’s dialogue lacks idiom differentiation in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "alchemized into something enduring" risks purple prose in closure; rhythm varies effectively with storm intensity, though one mixed metaphor ("furrowed hush") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prisoner exchange with familial redemption via drawer pull; avoids trope pitfalls through specific emotional stakes, though moon-phase method feels slightly derivative despite functional integration.</comment>
