<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but epiphany feels unearned; "dissonance of old guilt" borders on diagnostic label-speak. Final choice lacks contradictory impulses during tethering action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works, but cost remains abstract ("balm" contradicts felt sacrifice). Orientation test passed early, yet lens (Hybrid) ambiguity at climax weakens causal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Laboratory setting masterfully constrains choices (ether jars, oak desk), with amber as micro-setting charging final image. Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects Elara's urgency during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guilt resolution) tightens meaningfully via firmware escalation, but "time folding" lacks tactical consequence. Cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final line ("contours of forgiveness") violates organic emergence. Overly neat resolution into "peace" sacrifices complexity for sentimental closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet quiet," "fossilized past") shines, but uniform stress-response diction dulls peak-beat differentiation. No head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Template cadence ("time folded... time folded") in climax triggers -0.5 artifact penalty. High density elsewhere, but "black hole devours light" metaphor muddles closure's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tech (firmware translating cries) avoids tropes, yet "amber as balm" resolution feels safety-hedged. Risk-taking in mosaic time-folding elevates stakes coherently.</comment>
