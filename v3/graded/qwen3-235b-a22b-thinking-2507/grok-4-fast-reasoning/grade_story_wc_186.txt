<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (hope vs doubt) shown via shard reliance and vision struggles, but embodied emotion lacks specificity beyond "doubt gnawed." Micro-choices during prism hunt reveal value hierarchy, yet final triumph lacks visible cost escalation beyond implied exhaustion. "Thistle-light but unyielding" edges toward thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation perfect by line 3 ("solitary custodian," "decades after collapse"). Causal chain holds: shard vision → star path alignment → reassembly. Closure is decisive change (beam reignited) with undeniable conceptual cost in final thistle metaphor. Cost proof evident in "hope, like thistles on the wind, would find its way" crystallizing earned fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass pavilion functions as micro-setting constraint: its hum guides work, silence-shard drowns winds during alignment, and final beam shines through it. Thistles evolve from abstract "hope" to closure's charged symbol. Only flaw: thistle recurrence lacks mid-story tactical pressure until finale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving meaning in chaos) signaled immediately. Pressure tightens causally: storm threats → scavenging → alignment challenge. "Tension built as storms raged" shows meaningful escalation. Cost legible in her worn perseverance, though physical stakes could feel more visceral during prism hunt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through prism mechanics and thistle motif—never stated until closure's resonant "universe's quiet language." Final image reweights premise: broken world but hope persists via specific thistle metaphor. Avoids moralizing; complexity in "coincidences" balancing chaos and meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "callused hands tracing frost-etched rails," tactile focus under stress. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("jagged ruins whispered") to compressed ("Nights blurred into rhythm") during crisis. "Retrocognitively blessed" slightly clinical but offset by "thistle-light" coinage. No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose propels with varied syntax ("Each dawn, she climbed...") and zero loops. Minor scaffold: "driven by quiet motivation" redundant to preceding action. Thistle repetition risks thematic echo but redeemed by closure charge. Final line's "thistles on the wind" avoids sentimentality through concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via shard of hush (silence as tool) and retrocognition as practical star-guide. Emotional specificity in quiet perseverance avoids genre clichés. "Thistle-blown hope" feels fresh, though star-path mechanics lack one unexpected turn for 9.0-tier risk.</comment>
