<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "curiosity laced with duty" and micro-choices like brushing silt from photos, but grandfather's resentment resolution lacks embodied struggle; epiphany leans slightly tidy despite strong setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (photos reframing sacrifice) with felt cost in "expunging grudge," but the dawn meeting's seamless reconciliation weakens the Earned Stasis; orientation is crisp within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Reservoir's mirrored surface constrains choices (reflecting photos/stars) and charges the final "mirrored peace" image; mudflats and skeletal house evolve causally with plot, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when photos unveil generational resentment, but the dawn resolution lacks visible cost—tears flow too readily without friction, muting the promised "unspoken hatred" escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through photos' shifting meaning (loss→sacrifice) without moralizing; final image ("past and present flowed as one") reweights sacrifice as communal bridge, avoiding simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "velvet black of night" and "tide pool" observations; rhythmic control falters slightly in over-reliance on "precisely humane" as filter, diluting interiority under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops but "precisely humane" (3x) and "mirrored hush" repetitions verge on scaffold; lyrical density in opening risks muddling causality ("twilight bled into velvet black" delays plot).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drowned-town trope via photos as tangible memory-trail; risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens (pressure via density, not conflict) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
