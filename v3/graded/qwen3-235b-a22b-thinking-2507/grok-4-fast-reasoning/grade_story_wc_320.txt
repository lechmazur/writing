<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete bias-release via "casting pebbles," but emotional embodiment stays cerebral during pivotal moments; "fractured times" tells rather than shows struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: visions of renewal crystallize stakes with felt cost of releasing biases, though lunar perigee's time pressure remains underutilized in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Abandoned tower's void directly enables the "casting pebbles" micro-choice, and the Hollywood fragment constrains the climax by requiring precise placement in the receiver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's bias listing, but the "persistent noise" interference lacks tangible escalation; internal conflict resolves too neatly without sustained pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" reweights the gorge's void from threat to renewal source in the final image, avoiding moralizing while resonating with "beginning in every ending" through concrete visions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "brass gears and crystal lattices," but "practical magic at its finest" slips into explanatory voice during climax, disrupting immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose soars with "skeletal towers once beaming voices" yet stumbles on redundant "serenely electric" labels in key beats, slightly muddling the fragment's physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Celestial signal interpreter" transforms hope into technical craft; "shard of hush" synthesizes silence as active force, avoiding genre clichés through functional specificity.</comment>
