<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "surrender of pride" vs. her need for purpose, but micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during climax—her signing ritual proceeds without internal friction, weakening the 9+ quick test despite strong embodied emotion ("tremor in her fingers").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost: Elara’s "voice fading from annals" crystallizes her obsolescence under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by word 20 ("ancient terrace at midsummer"), though Thorne’s "folly" dialogue slightly over-explains stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rose quartz altar’s "flaws mirroring imperfections" charges the final image, while the terrace’s scarred valleys constrain Elara’s choices—environment directly shapes the ritual’s fragility. Sensory details (lavender smoke, blood ink) are purpose-driven and pressure-coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual mechanics: celestial timing forces blood signatures, narrowing options to pride’s surrender. Cost is unmistakable in Mira’s trembling hand and Thorne’s "reluctant stroke," but secondary conflict (Elara’s role loss) isn’t tested until closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via the "flawed beauty" motif reweighted in the dawn—"peace not perfect, but born of hard-won grace." Avoids moralizing, though "redemption always demanded its price" edges toward thematic echo in paragraph 3.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elara’s ritual-focused noticing ("smoke curled upward, carrying whispered incantations"), with rhythmic control during pressure ("lit the ritual flames... moved operatively gentle"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as moons align.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but "operatively gentle" label repeats without showing cost (paragraphs 1 and 4), creating synonym churn. Otherwise, high density: "ebony clipboard absorbing... like a confessor’s ledger" fuses object, theme, and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of peace negotiation tropes via celestial ritual stakes—transformed by specific constraints (blood ink, moon alignment). Risk-taking heightens coherence: the "flawed beauty" tone avoids saccharine hope, grounding universality in marble cracks and trembling signatures.</comment>
