<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen’s "symphonically minded" trait drives concrete micro-choices (e.g., analyzing stress cracks as "crescendos of pressure") with embodied emotion, but lacks contradictory impulses; her singular focus limits internal conflict depth despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the grove "pulsing with possibility" crystallizes options with felt cost ("profound, shared resonance"), under Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via "symphonically minded" framing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove functions as micro-setting—the stress cracks constrain Elowen’s method, and the porcelain insulator charges the final image by enabling resonance, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (cracks revealing "wood’s memory"), but pressure lacks tangible escalation; the hedgehog’s presence hints at time pressure yet doesn’t narrow options meaningfully under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "empathy in motion" reweights the premise via the insulator’s hum, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("symphony born from understanding the unbroken within the broken") offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—Elowen’s musical lens filters all description ("cracks spiderwebbing like forgotten sheet music"); rhythmic control intensifies during strumming ("vine gliding over porcelain") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("hummed faintly when touched, a relic from the world’s noisy past") propels momentum, though one borderline figurative stack ("sigh long withheld") slightly muddles peak beat clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "tree-song sculptor" trope through alder stress cracks as musical notation; specificity ("porcelain insulator repurposed as resonator") avoids abstraction, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety.</comment>
