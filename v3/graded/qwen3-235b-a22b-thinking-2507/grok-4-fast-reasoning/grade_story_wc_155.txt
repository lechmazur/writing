<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "pensive mirth" as he nearly trips yet feels delight, but "lost joy" motivation stays abstract despite micro-choices like positioning the fragment; final renewal lacks visible struggle against waking constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with café chatter becoming "symphony," but meta-commentary ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust") fractures causality and undermines the earned shift from oppressive to playful fog.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—transforming from "whispered secrets" to "playful veil"—while the fresco fragment constrains tactics (positioning against wall) and reappears in closure's lingering warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (projecting light to revive fresco), but cost remains conceptual—fragility of dream-joy against waking life—without concrete pressure like physical exhaustion or time loss narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "exposed film of history" metaphor crystallizes how time develops joy, with final image ("symphony rather than noise") offering non-literal answer to "lost joy" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("bitter coffee tasted of forgotten dreams"), but meta-commentary ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust") ruptures focalization, violating POV modesty and disrupting rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Exquisite density ("mist danced... chuckling at his intrusion") but meta-commentary creates paraphrase loop and template cadence in closure beat, dulling the final image and disqualifying 9+ per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "painting with light" with historical fresco revival avoids tropes, but dream-revival arc lacks bold risk; specificity in prisms/lanterns elevates without gimmickry, meeting ingenuity without revolution.</comment>
