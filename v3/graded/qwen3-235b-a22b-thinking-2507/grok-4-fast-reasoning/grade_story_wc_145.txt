<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through cartographer's precision and dry wit (e.g., tracing condensation with gloved finger), but "rivers don't start wars" line edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining embodied conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the falcon scouting the path crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("discovery laced with chill of unknown"), though the condensation revelation's convenience slightly blurs causal escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (condensation patterns on glass) actively constrains choices and charges the final image—Elias tracing veins that "bloomed like cold flesh" directly enables the convergence discovery, elevating beyond atmospheric backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as condensation patterns reconfigure Elias' understanding, but the "tempests beneath ice" doubt feels under-dramatized; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt despite strong escalation toward the escarpment journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through cartographic metaphors—rivers "born entwined" reweighting imperial power ("one overlooked tributary could unravel empires")—with no moralizing; final image offers resonant answer via "singular convergence" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (cartographer's precision in "dry-witted footnotes," "veins on cold flesh") modulates perfectly under pressure; polyglot phrasebook annotations showcase controlled diction shifts without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion—"frozen lake mirrored the outpost's rust in fractured panes" weaves setting/action—but "air thick with worrying tranquility, as if..." contains minor scaffold redundancy preventing 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms explorer trope via cartographer's lens; condensation navigation method feels fresh and inevitable. Avoids sentimentality but "worrisome tranquility" phrasing slightly echoes genre conventions without full reinvention.</comment>
