<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("faith in the old ways") with minor therapy-speak, but "warmly curious" manifests concretely through tracing carvings and rebuilding. Final endurance of quiet continuity earns closure, though motivation lacks visceral specificity in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "lost faith reignited—not in grand revelation, but in the quiet enchantment of continuity" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with visible cost in "hands bridging catacomb's depths to sunlit world." No orientation debt; lens held flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively pressures choices (tremors halting work, fog forcing halts), with roots and bones constraining excavation tactics. Sundial base charges the final image, though early "sun-baked valley" lacks specificity to anchor who/where.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith through ancestral connection) tightens via interruptions (tremor, fox) that compound labor cost. Agency in rebuilding earns closure, but early stakes feel internalized rather than viscerally tested until sundial discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "shards of pottery depicting wanderers" and sundial reassembly reweight "interrupted journeys" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer—"journeys no longer forever interrupted"—avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cautious enchantment" humming through groves) sustains voice under pressure. Free indirect style ("wondering if this base had once topped a pillar") avoids filter verbs. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates with excavation intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("purposeful wandering" repeated 3x) and abstract phrasing ("faith in the old ways") slightly dull momentum, but lyrical density serves the Accumulative lens. Final line’s "quiet enchantment of continuity" achieves high propulsion with zero loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora tropes through specific catacomb logic and "interrupted journeys" as tangible pressure. Bold Accumulative structure risks disorientation but pays off via earned stasis. Avoids safety middle with morally ambiguous faith restoration.</comment>
