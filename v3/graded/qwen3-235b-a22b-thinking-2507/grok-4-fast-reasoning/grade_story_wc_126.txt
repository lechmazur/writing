<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict; motivation is clear but not tested through contradictory impulses. Backstory told not shown, and secondary characters serve as passive audience without altering Elias's state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation test fails (who/where unclear past 120 words), costing 0.4. Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but cost legibility weakens the final image's conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice: water pools alter violin vibrations, shipwrecks provide acoustic properties. Final bowl image charges closure, though "mendicant's bowl" could deepen micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens—chronic hush presents passive resistance without narrowing options. Cost is felt but not earned through struggle; motivation faces no active opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (bowl ripples, violin vibrations), avoiding moralizing. Final pebble ritual reweights "unfinished beauty" non-literally, though "magnificent simplicity" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faint ripple of water against wood") modulates with pressure. Filter verbs ("Elias was perceptive enough to hear") dull immediacy in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "magnificent simplicity" appears twice as label-only phrase. Final line ("unfinished yet eternally alive") achieves crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustics and ritual, but post-apocalyptic framework lacks bold risk. Specificity (violin vibrating water pools) elevates tropes, yet safety-hedging avoids deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
