<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction underdeveloped; "polished calm" trait lacks embodied tension during pivotal conflict. Final insight feels unearned as no visible cost anchors the realization beyond abstract reflection. Micro-choices under pressure remain superficial despite strong setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; economic collapse happens off-scene weakening felt stakes. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Hybrid) persists past midpoint, failing clarity check despite poetic resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Circus train functions as essential micro-setting: constrains choices (HQ/funding/defense) and charges final image. Foreign bills evolve from talisman to territorial markers, meeting 9+ gate. Overuse of "dusky harmony" label slightly dilutes atmospheric specificity in climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conflict resolution lacks earned escalation: rivals withdraw via "eerie poetry" rather than protagonist agency. No visible price paid for territorial markers (e.g., legal consequences), undermining pressure under Accumulative lens. Stakes remain abstract despite strong initial setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thematic Echo penalty: final paragraph states thesis ("not as curses, but as invitations") replacing earned resonance. Foreign bills' evolution avoids moralizing, but "paths circle back" repetition feels mechanical. Closure insight lacks friction between want/fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose lush but repetitive stems ("polished calm" x4, "dusky harmony" x3) create scaffold loops in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature lacks character-specific filtering (e.g., rail-expert noticing track details). Rhythmic control strong except during territorial marker scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in closure beat ("looping rails," "circle back") and filter-verb stacks ("viewed," "observed") dull immediacy. Foreign money description repeats with minimal variation. Final line's mixed metaphor ("harmonize echoes in twilight") obscures conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Familiar redemption arc lacks transformative detail; circus train setting vivid but not unique to premise. Emotional truth in legacy struggle outweighs generic "paths" metaphor. Risk in Accumulative structure partially redeemed by tangible setting, but ending insight feels predictable.</comment>
