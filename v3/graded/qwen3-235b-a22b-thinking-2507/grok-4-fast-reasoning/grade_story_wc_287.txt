<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wistfully pragmatic" tension between dreams and soil pH, but petal-scattering closure lacks concrete cost manifestation beyond reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with petals scattering onto water, reweighting loss into resilience; cost legible in "fear of impermanence taken root" yet escalation lacks one meaningful tightening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lockmaster's gauge tooth constrains choice (measuring memory) and charges final image; harbor's moonlight actively mirrors inner transformation rather than static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through petal-scattering ritual with visible emotional cost, but "protected vulnerability" unraveling lacks one tangible pressure point narrowing options earlier in the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of petals reflecting light into doubt's "dark corners" resonantly answers grief's central question without moralizing, perfectly reweighting father's locksmith metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("coaxing roses from unyielding urban air"), but minor register drift occurs in "conceptual repricing" abstraction during peak reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with crystalline rhythm ("curling away like a sigh"), yet "wistfully pragmatic" label repetition in high-pressure beats risks thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lockmaster's gauge transforms trope into organic metaphor; risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens heightens stakes without gimmickry through moonlit harbor symbolism.</comment>
