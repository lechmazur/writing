<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s riddle-speaking nature unraveling during apology, but diagnostic label "fierce tenderness" appears thrice without embodied variation, flattening emotional progression at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "time bent, allowing her to tear open the envelopes in her mind" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (rewriting the stars), but condensation messages risk thematic echo in final paragraph without sufficient dramatic friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove roots parting as Elara emerges charges the final image, fulfilling 9+ gate via micro-setting constraining choice; however, "singing spirits" function more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through moonlight-healing shard enabling the condensation messages, but the pivotal moment before deciding lacks concrete escalation—pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing options until the final vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through unsent letters transforming from physical objects to "words flying free like birds," avoiding moralizing; however, "rewrite the stars" risks thematic overstatement that slightly dilutes earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "roots coiled like forgotten promises," but repeated "fierce tenderness" creates uniform tics under stress, reducing rhythmic control during peak apology sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Condensation message sequence ("traced," "bloomed," "reformed") forms paraphrase loop; elevated diction ("cryptic medium," "resonant reconfiguration") clashes with Elara’s embodied voice during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mangrove labyrinth as emotional landscape feels inevitable, but "singing spirits" borrows heavily from common mystical tropes without sufficient transformation for risk distinction.</comment>
