<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for tracing collective grief is clear through mother's absence and ritual, but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; Elias's change feels guided rather than earned through internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the ribbon's weave reveals grief's shape, with conceptual cost in Elias's transformation; however, drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) isn't solidified until 60% mark, delaying narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting charges the final image (stone echoing ribbon's weave), but rusted panes/vines don't constrain choices; sensory details like "damp earth" vividly anchor mood without driving tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping collective grief) tightens via migration deadline, but escalation lacks visible cost until closure; Elias's agency is passive under Liora's guidance, weakening pressure buildup despite resonant payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ribbon motif ("resilient braid" reweights grief), avoiding moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer where woven stone embodies collective sorrow without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fogged by breath of forgotten seasons," but "fiercely meditative" label repeats without embodied contradiction; voice modulates well under spectral pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor figurative muddle in "amorphous force" and slight overuse of "thundering calm" (3x); otherwise, high density ("butterflies' wings a silent thunder") propels momentum without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as tangible weave avoids cliché, but spectral mentor trope isn't fully transformed; emotional specificity in ribbon's knots elevates beyond template, though quartz eyes feel derivative.</comment>
