<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's embodied contradictions shine: gnarled hands steady yet body aching, using ribbon as tool not token. Micro-choice threading ribbon through quartz lattice reveals hierarchy of values. Near-deduction for "endearingly feisty" label repetition but saved by context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: seeker pressing mended eye reveals "accidental wisdom" with conceptual cost of vows regrowing from ruins. Accumulative lens holds through rain-accelerated ripening and physical strain. Backstory fragments anchor present via ribbon retrieval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard functions as active constraint: vines enable pulley system, rain nurtures bloom affecting tactics. Ribbon (micro-setting) charges final image when tied to branch. "Sap from wounded bark" exemplifies POV-filtered specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending wisdom before death) tightens through Elias's aching body and rain-driven urgency. Agency as endurance forecloses path with felt cost. Slight underweighting of physical cost against conceptual stakes prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: ribbon binding quartz, orchard regrowing. Final branch-tying offers non-literal answer to "deciduous vows" without moralizing. "Accidental wisdom" avoids abstraction via seeker's socket moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong: notices "fractured facets," "sap from wounded bark." Cadence mirrors meticulous work. Deducted for "endearingly feisty" verbatim repetition bordering on thematic label despite context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; "blue hue seeping into quartz like dye into water" shows crystalline specificity. Minor paraphrase loop ("deciduous vows" recurrence) prevented 9.0. Final "cathedral seemed to nod" avoids sentimentality through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned church" trope via orchard invasion and quartz eyes as wisdom vessels. Ribbon's practical binding use feels fresh. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with mosaic cohering at closure.</comment>
