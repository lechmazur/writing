<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via dye-master's watchful fear vs donor-heart's urging toward stories; micro-choice tilting the slate reveals value hierarchy. Epiphany slightly over-articulated in "fearing explosion of exposure" without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun-trail refraction deepens iridescent caution with felt cost in "fearing explosion of exposure." Orientation clear by 50 words; closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with cost visible in her step toward the mist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floating tea house actively pressures choices—thermal drift enables sun alignment—while morpho wing constrains her action, charging the final image as mist parts "like a story yielding." Micro-setting (slate table, petrified cup) filters all perception through dye-master's craft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (fear of exposure vs magnetizing stories) tightens via wing's light revealing donor's memories. Agency clear in tilting slate, changing knowledge with cost ("hidden colors behind watchful walls"). Cost slightly abstract; needs sharper physical tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wing's shifting light: "iridescent caution" evolves from warning to embraced truth. Final image ("mist parting like a story") resonantly answers "why magnetize stories" without moralizing. No thematic echo; wisdom earned through sun-trail refraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "cataloging subtle shifts in expressions" as dye master; rhythm shifts from lyrical ("liquid fire") to urgent ("breath caught"). "Quietly explosive" slightly thematic but voice remains character-particular. Zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "sapphire to teal in hypnotic waves" does triple duty. Minor paraphrase loop with "quietly explosive" (3x) and "watchful" (3x) in opening; no closure impact. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms transplant trope via dye-master specificity: "iridescent caution" redefines magnetism as fragile shimmer. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but "dare to shimmer" insight edges toward familiar terrain despite fresh execution.</comment>
