<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict—fear of abandonment versus aquatic heritage—is embodied in visceral micro-choices (clutching scrimshaw, wading toward island) without therapy-speak. Her motivation intensifies credibly under pressure, though "guarded heart" phrasing slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: her transformation forecloses the dock worker identity with visible cost ("facade that chained her"), anchored by causal escalation (scrimshaw discovery → whale call → island emergence). Minor causality gap: whale call mechanics lack concrete rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (wading from shallows) and charges the final image (diving into deep). Scrimshaw’s evolution from relic to beacon reweights meaning, though plankton description flirts with cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara’s choice to wade toward the island narrows options, with felt cost in shedding her human identity. "Combative tenderness" deepens the internal/external conflict fusion, though the post-violence pact lacks tactical impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the scrimshaw’s transformation and final "unchained horizon," avoiding moralizing. The resonant answer—freedom as self-acceptance, not flight—is earned through visceral particulars, not abstract philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct marine-focused perceptual signature ("callused yet precise," "frothed like whispered secrets") modulates rhythm effectively. Minor voice slippage in repeated "combative tenderness," but compression under pressure remains purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush prose risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "tremor—not of fear..."), with slight metaphor muddle ("whispered secrets"). Final image’s propulsion ("dove into the deep") compensates, though scrimshaw’s warmth-to-burning shift feels slightly mannered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms merfolk trope through specific stakes (post-violence pact, "combative tenderness") and fresh inflection: freedom via self-acceptance, not escape. Avoids derivative safety-middle with emotionally complex cost in shedding human identity.</comment>
