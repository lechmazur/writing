<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s pruning vs unspoken regrets, but Mira’s absence limits relationship crucible; the pine-weaving closure earns endurance with palpable cost ("wound reopening like a poorly healed branch").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: cerulean shade revelation reweights regret into peace with felt cost ("unspoken apologies take form"); Accumulative lens holds through lace instructions payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Islet constrains choices (seawater collection, compass discovery) and charges the final image, but verbatim "rhythmically placid" repetition triggers a -0.2 Text Artifact Screen deduction despite micro-setting strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency (following lace instructions), with cost legible in reliving Mira’s departure; minor friction in compass’s spectral runes feeling slightly convenient for Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from lace/bonsai metaphors, but "palette for his healing" skirts thematic echo; final cerulean image resonates without moralizing, reweighting regret into earned peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gnarled hands," "cerulean regret") with rhythmic control, though "unspoken apologies hanging like anchors" creates a minor metaphor clash in peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but verbatim "rhythmically placid" repetition and overused "diffuse" trigger -0.3 Text Artifact Screen; no closure impact keeps it above 8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via bonsai discipline and textile cryptography; cerulean regret reframing feels inevitable, though ghost ship compass edges toward familiar symbolism without full derangement.</comment>
