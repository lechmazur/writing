<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear (save twin via mirrors) but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "borrowed heartbeat" drives action yet emotional struggle remains abstract ("whispered of impermanence" tells rather than embodies cost). Micro-choices during singing lack visible tradeoffs beyond graceful poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (heartbeat "pulsing freely" reweights mirage impermanence with conceptual cost), but cost proof is weak—impermanence stated not felt through action. Accumulative lens holds via lullaby density shift, though causal aspirations ("persuaded the mirrors") create minor lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains choice (voice amplification enables coded songs) and charges final image (refracting heartbeat). Sensory details (rain-slick stone, lavender light) evolve with plot, avoiding white-room syndrome while mirroring internal states through tactile interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via lullaby escalation (ripples→shimmer→visions), narrowing options to "endless dusky harmonies." Cost is conceptual (impermanence of visions) but feels distant; visceral loss of twin lacks on-page manifestation beyond heartbeat metaphor, weakening cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirage logic: "borrowed life" reframed as purpose in impermanence. Final heartbeat image offers resonant answer without moralizing, though "grace the impossible" near-conclusion risks thematic echo. Complexity avoids false balance but secondary stake (guild evasion) remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catching subtle shifts in light") and rhythmic control shine in lullaby sequences. Voice modulates with pressure (soft whispers to prismatic echoes), though "perceptively calm" trait flattens emotional range during high-stakes singing. Zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax ("prismatic echoes that danced like fireflies") triggers density penalty; "fragile rhythm gifted from dying twin" uses therapy-speak label. Strong propulsion otherwise, but metaphor muddle in high-pressure beat prevents 8.5+. Final line’s "heartbeat of tomorrow" avoids sentimentality through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirage painting and lullaby coding feels inevitable, with prism physics grounding magic. Avoids safety middle via emotional specificity (twin’s death as heartbeat), though "guild of realists" remains underutilized trope. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry but lacks one transformative inflection beyond premise.</comment>
