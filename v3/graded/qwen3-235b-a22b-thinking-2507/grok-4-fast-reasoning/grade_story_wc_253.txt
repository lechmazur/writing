<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "blank face" performance masking grief; micro-choice of whittling as tangible action shapes closure. Avoids therapy-speak despite moral ambiguity exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: bird carving crystallizes "lightness" cultivation with visible cost ("grief's unyielding soil"). Accumulative lens holds via density escalation in whittling sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Wind turbines actively constrain choice (casting shadows on work), while gnarled branch/tool becomes micro-setting charging final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through whittling ritual's deepening—each stroke reconfigures grief into "lightness" with felt cost. Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens; "bruised purples" sunset charges final trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brittle bouquet and carved bird reprise; "fragile bloom against the void" avoids moralizing while reweighting mandate's legacy. No thematic echo in finale.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "hush reconstructed from mandate's fall" lexicon; rhythmic control under stress ("Whittle, whittle") taught early. Voice modulates from stage-whisper to murmured closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "peeling away layers in deliberate strokes" demonstrates high density. "Remade hush" repetition earns pattern credit without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via specific "joy theater" performer lens; emotional truth in "cultivating lightness" synthesis feels inevitable. Bold risk in quiet closure that charges stakes.</comment>
