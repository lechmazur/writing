<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("careful recklessness") and embodied emotion (trembling fingers, iridescent stains) drive choices; Thorne's skepticism cracking like thin ice shows status shift under pressure. Micro-choice of tracing Thorne's name into the symphony reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure where ink symphony reconfigures trust. Cost legibility falters—Thorne's widened eyes show emotional shift but lack concrete stakes (e.g., what's forfeited if promises fail?). Orientation anchors within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (glass inkwell) constrains choice: its liquid midnight ink enables the promise ritual and charges the final image ("corked the inkwell, the glass catching a final glint"). Sensory details filter through Elara's linguist bias (glyphs "like captured stars"), avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (trust restoration) tighten through Elara's agency: each glyph etched narrows options toward the final chord. Cost remains abstract—no tangible loss (e.g., Thorne withholding vital research)—weakening the felt price. Single deepening suffices for length but conceptual cost needs sharper articulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink symphony's evolution from metaphor to action; final image ("symphony fading into hopeful quiet") offers non-literal answer to silence's cost. Near-miss: "rebuild without reservation" borders on thematic echo but avoids direct moralizing. Complexity lies in trust requiring active weaving, not passive return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: linguist's POV notices "swirling glyphs that caught light like captured stars." Dialogue carries subtext ("I promise to hear you out... as I once did") with distinct cadence. Stress compresses diction ("carefully reckless") without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid midnight" metaphor integrates cleanly with closure image. Minor overwriting in "dust motes danced like forgotten syllables" slightly dilutes momentum. Final line’s "ready to face whatever lay beyond together" avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("stood closer").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden language" trope via linguist-specific mechanics (interconnected promises as staves). Emotional truth in mending trust through collaborative creation, not grand gestures. Risk-taking: abstract symphony concept grounded in tactile inkwell ritual. Avoids safety middle with morally ambiguous silence erosion.</comment>
