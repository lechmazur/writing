<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied trauma ("snowflakes melted into skin") and contradictory impulses (safety vs song), but the bolt-memory reflection edges toward over-articulated insight during peak pressure, slightly diluting the earned final choice to "remain" as a vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("unpardonable silence was no curse, but a vow") under Accumulative lens; reflection exceeds 30% yet anchors to present via micro-choice (pocketing bolt) and tilts stance without orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress actively constrains choices (elevator creaks, snow's weight) and the bolt charges closure; "frostbitten hope" tone evolves into "fragile melody" with sensory precision, though "seraphically mundane" feels marginally authorial rather than character-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake (cost of safety) deepens through atmospheric pressure rather than causal turns; bolt discovery narrows options by crystallizing silence's meaning, but nerve regeneration timeframe lacks live-clock urgency to tighten tactics as required for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "unpardonable silence" transforms from burden to vow without moralizing; final image ("weight of hope renewed") reweights safety's cost conceptually, though "regeneration wasn't just of nerves" flirts with abstraction near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice shines with distinct perceptual signature ("ochre smudge where grime had worn thin") and rhythmic control, but "seraphically mundane" disrupts lexicon plausibility for a traumatized bellhop, creating minor register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("jagged blue walls pierced endless white drifts"), but scaffold appears in "driven by quiet motivation" and "safety here meant isolation" – minor tells that dilute immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms asylum trope via cobalt fortress specificity and "unpardonable silence" as active concept; nerve regeneration angle feels fresh, though "seraphically mundane" risks thematic convenience without sufficient causal pressure.</comment>
