<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; Elias’s rebellion lacks genuine friction despite vivid embodied emotion in sap-tasting moment. Flaws don’t compound choices, missing 9+ gate for contradictory impulses driving earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost in pruning labor, but "synaptic plasticity" mechanism remains abstract, weakening causal proof at climax. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost legibility falters slightly in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details anchor atmosphere powerfully ("crunched on shattered pots"), but greenhouse setting doesn’t constrain choices—it’s a backdrop, not an active pressure. Misses 9+ gate where environment must charge final image beyond lyricism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sap-triggered memories, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; celestial alignment passively enables growth. Cost (vigilant watch, pruning) feels earned yet emotionally muted, missing high-band pressure intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through pruning-as-rebellion motif; final image ("rusty frames cradling green hope") reweights decay into possibility without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, achieving resonant subtext via concrete acts like communal broth sharing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct culinary perceptual signature shines ("flavors whispered secrets"), but "synaptic plasticity" explanations drift into clinical diction, clashing with Elias’s voice during high-pressure planting. Rhythmic control remains exceptional under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("ruins demanded tending"/"beauty from ruins") and filter verbs ("he felt a shift") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language stays coherent, but "latent promise" risks abstraction in pivotal seed-planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary magic realism and ecological resistance; "tasting memories" trope transformed through specific sap-triggered recollections. Risk-taking (celestial botany) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though synaptic plasticity edges toward familiar neuro-magic.</comment>
