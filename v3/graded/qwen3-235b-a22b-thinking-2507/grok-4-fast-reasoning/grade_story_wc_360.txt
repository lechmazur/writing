<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "borrowed tears" climax, but "transposed empathy" label edges toward diagnostic speech during disorientation beat, slightly undermining embodied emotion under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"topaz walls pulsing like a heartbeat" crystallizes cost of emotional collision, with lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through vanishing stars payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Topaz workshop qualifies as micro-setting: "pulsing like a heartbeat" during crisis charges closure image, though oil/scent details remain decorative without tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen credibly as transposed empathy backfires, but "mathematics of emotion" stays slightly abstract; cost legible via astronomer/mother collision yet dominant stake lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("borrowed tears," "turbulent flow of shared feeling") reweights premise without moralizing, transforming quantification quest into embodied connection—thematic echo avoided through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("frozen amber" walls, stars as "secrets") modulates perfectly under pressure; rhythm accelerates during disorientation, no head-hopping despite borrowed personalities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "fractured rainbows across the type" slightly muddles high-pressure beat, but zero loops and "vanishing stars" motif maintains propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Letterpress craft fused with emotional quantification feels fresh; risk-taking in transposed empathy mechanics deepens stakes without gimmickry, though premise leans slightly familiar.</comment>
