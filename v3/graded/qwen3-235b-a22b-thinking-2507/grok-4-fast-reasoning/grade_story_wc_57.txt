<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; Elias’s unwavering patience avoids meaningful internal conflict despite high stakes. Final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: rope warming and fulgurite capture crystallize options with visceral cost (tears/snowmelt). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through atmospheric pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Golden dock constrains every choice—knot decoding requires tactile navigation in snow/fog. Final image of Elias walking "carrying seeds" recharges the dock’s "forgotten sunlight" with irreversible consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s physical vulnerability (snow-dusted shoulders, hours in fog), but external pressure remains static. Cost is felt but not actively tested beyond endurance; one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through rope/fulgurite mechanics: "binding knowledge against time’s ravages" crystallizes in the final capture. Avoids moralizing; "seeds that would bloom" resonates as earned, non-literal answer to preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—"oceanic hush," "prismatic whispers"—with rhythmic control matching Elias’s patience. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via snow/fog sensory narrowing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bioluminescent creatures rising" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Near-miss: "philosophical seeds" risks abstraction but redeemed by concrete decoding actions throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folkloric knot-lore with epistemology; "secret weavers" transforms trope through tactile rope mechanics. Risks poetic abstraction but anchors universals in dock/snow specificity.</comment>
