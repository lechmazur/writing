<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied sorrow ("lotus-hearted ache") and micro-choice (transcribing notes), but Jamal's passivity eliminates relationship dynamics. "Shrewdly innocent" trait lacks pressure-testing; final endurance feels static without escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise RR with conceptual cost ("mended her own" via coral), but single-scene accumulation lacks meaningful deepening—decryption progresses linearly without narrowing options or intensifying pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist-atrium setting charges closure: "mist thickened, blurring waking/reverie" mirrors emotional release. Coral fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (decrypting tool) and reweights the final image ("pocketed... weight a reminder").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("shared anxieties") remains thematic rather than dramatized—Jamal’s sleep removes active pressure. No visible cost emerges beyond Elara’s pre-existing grief; decryption lacks meaningful tightening as anxiety-sharing resolves without trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme undermined by Thematic Echo: "fears unknot when shared" explicitly states the thesis in the final third. Coral’s reprise charges closure ("bridge between losses"), but moralizing ("anxieties shared and thus diminished") replaces earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shrewdly innocent eyes," "coral’s brain-like form") with rhythmic control, though "lotus-hearted" repetition risks label-speak. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during decryption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong cadence and textural specificity ("plaster cast smudged with hurried scrawls"), but overwrought phrasing ("labyrinthine surface etched with natural patterns resembling neural pathways") muddles peak beats. No closure-impacting loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator/coral motifs avoids tropes through specific lived detail ("decrypting smudged notes"), but "pacific conflict-zone translator" leans template-like without sufficient transformation of the peacemaker archetype.</comment>
