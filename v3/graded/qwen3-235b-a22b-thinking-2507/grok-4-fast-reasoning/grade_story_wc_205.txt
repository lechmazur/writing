<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans abstract; "burnished sorrow" risks stock phrasing. Contradictions (revolutionary vs. poet) not simultaneously active in high-pressure beats. Over-tidy resolution undermines earned cost—skeptics soften without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure valid Charged Poise (mirrors unchanged but eyes gleaming with purpose), but cost not legible on-page—no specific forfeiture image. Orientation strong; accumulative lens consistent with density increase toward visions coalescing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Baroque setting pressures choices: vaults supply shard, salon mirrors pivotal for ritual. Recurring object (shard) charges closure—edges smooth as "relic of reimagination." "Burnished sorrow" overused without evolving meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (resolve dispute to heal revolution scars) signaled early; pressure builds via storm intensity and vision density. Cost vague—hope replaces sorrow without dramatized loss (e.g., no lingering doubt in skeptics). Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from shard refracting timelines into unity; final line ("sorrow burnished, but never extinguished") resonates non-literally. Near-moralizing ("contrived history") edges on thematic echo, avoiding outright penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong ("spectral silk," "frozen screams"), but syntax lacks stress compression during storm—Elias remains lyrical amid chaos. "Poetically inclined" label weakens voice consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Figurative density blurs storm scene: "timeline tendrils coiling" and "arches groaning" reduce immediacy. "Burnished sorrow" repeats 4x; template cadence ("Elias, [comma], [verb]") dulls key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "archaeological dispute" via time-as-visible-silk; shard as bridge between cultures feels fresh. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "defunct revolutionary" arc borders familiar.</comment>
