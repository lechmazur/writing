<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in forging histories vs meteorite truth, but "fragile hope" edges toward abstraction; micro-choices like releasing the pigeon earn trust arc without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: meteorite chip becomes shared talisman while "withering fears" crystallizes the earned shift from isolation; lens (Accumulative) holds via dust mote patterns reconfiguring meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting actively constrains choices—dust motes guide balance ritual, meteorite anchors reality—charging the final image where motes "swirled eternally" under the skylight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pigeon test and Mira's arrival, but betrayal's cost remains retrospective; "doubts withered quickly" softens pressure without sufficient present-tense consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through paper trails vs meteorite reality; final image of "echoes sang on" resonates without moralizing, though "blooming trust" slightly echoes prompt language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cosmic fire" veins and dust mote choreography; rhythm modulates under stress (e.g., "hesitated, the meteorite chip heavy in his palm") without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "tone of his days bloomed with fragile hope" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise zero loops, high density ("pulsing faintly in the attic's slanted light" charges closure).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorite as truth-anchor against paper forgeries feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry ("motes swirled eternally" reweights reinvention).</comment>
