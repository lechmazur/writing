<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (fear vs. empathy surge) drives action; "firm tenderness" manifests in micro-choices like multilingual weaving without therapy-speak. Klaus’ wary emergence tests her empathy, but secondary characters lack distinct flaws beyond isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: talks succeed with visible cost (weight "lighter, infused with harmony"), foreclosing isolation. Accumulative lens holds via density increase—multilingual fragments accumulate into shared song—reweighting "bridges" stake. Lens inferred by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Astronomical tower and cuckoo weight constrain choices (oiling gears, swinging as pendulum); "borrowed starlight" evolves from atmosphere to closure’s "light generously... witnessing." Micro-setting (weight) charges final image, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community fracture) tightens via Elara’s agency: language-weaving deepens trust, narrowing options to shared irrigation/festivals. Cost legible in "silos emptying of isolation," but secondary water-rights conflict resolves without lasting consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (song adaptation, weight-swinging), not abstraction. Final image—"silos into symphonies"—reweights "bridges" non-literally. Avoids moralizing, though "rehabilitate" phrasing flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: librarian’s "choral" voice filters setting ("whispering secrets," "cascade"). Multilingual dialogue carries subtext (Javier’s "drought tales"), with syntax shifts under stress (rapid Polski → English barbs). No head-hopping despite multiple speakers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("stars borrowed light generously" compresses victory). Final line’s "symphonies" avoids cliché via concrete prior work. Minor register drift: "rehabilitate" feels academic amid lyrical prose, dulling closure charge slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: astronomical mechanics (clock gears) literalize social "gears," avoiding metaphor clichés. Risk-taking (multilingual lyricism) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—replace "choral librarian" with generic mediator breaks causality.</comment>
