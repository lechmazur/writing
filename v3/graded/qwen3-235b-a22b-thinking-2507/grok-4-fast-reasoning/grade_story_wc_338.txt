<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in map-framing specificity; grief-driven motivation manifests in tactile choices like cross-referencing journals. Final chapel entry earns endurance through prior causality, though "empathetic weight of ages" borders on label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds through visual density escalation; video comparison creates pattern break that reweights the henge. Closure lands as Charged Poise—door opening releases silent air carrying conceptual cost of irreversible passage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault constrains Elias' work methods early and mirrors the chapel's condition at closure, charging the final image. Micro-setting (projector beam cutting mist) directly shapes the video comparison breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when footage reveals the latch—Elias' agency narrows options from investigation to irreversible entry. Cost crystallizes in the silent air's "empathetic weight," reconfiguring his lifelong quest under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silent footage comparisons and the chapel's "unspoken plea," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("map's divide now crossed") reweights silence as carrier of meaning without stating a moral, though "empathetic weight" risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in map-focused details ("subtle folds and faded inks"); rhythm modulates from methodical to urgent during projection scene. Single elevated phrase ("empathetic weight") fits Elias' lexicon but edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the beam cutting through mist like a cautious revelation" integrate setting/action/theme. Final line avoids overwriting while charging closure—only minor deduction for borderline abstract phrasing at climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted archaeology" trope through silence-as-medium; video comparison method feels fresh. Emotional truth in grief-driven curiosity elevates beyond novelty, though henge/chapel setup leans familiar.</comment>
