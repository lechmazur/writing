<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Embodied claustrophobia ("clawed at him," "vice") and micro-choices (forcing hatch open despite panic) anchor motivation, but late mentor backstory feels slightly told rather than dramatized through present-tense tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: codex dissolution carries conceptual cost ("names restored in digital whispers"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric pressure buildup to the serene pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice relentlessly—the flooded corridor's "throat"-like narrowing forces physical/emotional endurance, while brine-slick walls and tidal timing directly charge the final escape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's agency (returning codex to honor unremembered), but phase transitions lack sufficient mechanical tension; the method's peril feels declared rather than viscerally tested in his choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "crashing hush" motif reweighted at closure—silent return of scientists via cables becomes resonant answer to "standing by unremembered" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ocean pressing down like an unyielding whisper") modulates with stress, and rhythmic control ("walls slick with brine and echoing his ragged breaths") heightens pressure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops and high density ("gold flecks catching his light like stars in ink" → "pulsed faintly, as if alive"), but minor scaffold in "motivated by a vow to stand by the unremembered" slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of undersea cables as spectral conduits feels inevitable; "crashing hush" transforms tidal noise into emotional texture, avoiding cliché through precise technical/haunting duality.</comment>
