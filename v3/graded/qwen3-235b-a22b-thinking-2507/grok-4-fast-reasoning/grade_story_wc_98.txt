<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation ("protect cultural memory") but interiority leans abstract; "luminous doubt" repeats as label without sufficient embodied contradiction during ritual climax. Micro-choices align with goals yet lack visceral stakes in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (sprout glistens amid monsoon threat), cost legible in "had she truly protected... or delayed inevitable flood?" Weakness: dream-to-ritual escalation lacks causal friction—ancestors directly "nod" with minimal struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the seed constrains every choice and charges the final image ("shoot glistening under moonlight"). "Pre-monsoon warmth" and "loamy heart" anchor tactile urgency, though dream faces verge on symbolic over literal constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory vs. monsoon) tightens via "distant rumble" and "clouds gathered," cost in "luminous doubt persisted." Escalation lacks deepening—pressure grows but no reversal tests commitment; ritual succeeds without meaningful complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "empirically whimsical" motif: final image ("whimsical empiricism binding them all") reweights memory’s fragility without moralizing. Slight abstraction in "cultural memory" prevents 9+; could better dramatize what specific memories were saved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice ("orchids unfurled like forgotten secrets") with perceptual signature (noticing scientific/whimsical blends). "Luminous doubt" repetition risks tic; ritual description converges toward generic cadence, diluting pressure in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with clean propulsion, but "luminous doubt" appears 4x early (text-artifact). Figurative muddle in "petals questioning vibrancy" slightly obscures causality; final lines ("shoot glistening") redeem with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reality checker" role and "empirically whimsical" concept avoids tropes. Monsoon-as-forgetfulness metaphor familiar but transformed through specific mechanics (interpreted dreams). Not radically new yet deeply coherent.</comment>
