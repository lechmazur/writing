<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (rooted yet reaching), but "anxious elation" repetition flattens embodied emotion; sap-burning motivation compellingly drives the scar-linking climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost ("scars tingling with unity") lacks visceral legibility; disorientation waived as cobalt glade anchors early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (root anchoring) and charges the final image; blue leaves/indigo sky evolve causally with the temporal rift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency pressing the clipping to her scar, but escalation lacks meaningful trade-offs; dominant covenant stake remains viscerally felt through scar imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("dreams intersecting without fracture") resonantly answers the central question through concrete particulars; avoids moralizing while reweighting "eclipsed covenant" via the wilting clipping’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in botanical diction ("sap burning," "gnarled trunk"), but "purposefully curious" feels diagnostic; rhythmic control falters with repetitive "anxious elation" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in "anxious elation" descriptions dull high-pressure beats; otherwise vivid propulsion, though "maze topiary clipping" description borders on ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical and temporal motifs feels inevitable; "cobalt glade" specificity transforms fantasy tropes while the scar-linking method avoids gimmickry.</comment>
