<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in compass interaction and pole navigation, but "backlash of regrets" labels undermine embodied emotion; reconciliation choice feels earned though Lena's sudden appearance lacks prior causal groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with compass-talisman and steady stars, but cost legibility falters—Lena's presence softens stakes; orientation anchors firmly within 120 words via kayak launch details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains navigation choices and charges the final image; coastal atmosphere pressures every decision, though phosphorescent waves feel ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through environmental pressure (clouds, useless compass), but dolphins' appearance injects unearned hope; dominant "reconcile with Lena" stake signals early yet Lena's beach arrival lacks causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass/pole navigation metaphors without moralizing; final stars reweight "flickering faith" non-literally, though "merrily melancholic" repetition risks thematic echo in closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ramp creaking like reluctant confession," but "merrily melancholic" repeats like a tic, flattening voice under pressure; no head-hopping despite single-POV reflection depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts with strong propulsion, but "backlash of regrets" phrasing loops twice near climax; compass description avoids purple prose yet "merrily melancholic" repetition triggers -0.3 scaffold penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Utility-pole navigation transforms reconciliation trope with coastal specificity; emotional truth in compass failure feels fresh, though estranged wife framework leans familiar without Lena's prior on-page presence.</comment>
