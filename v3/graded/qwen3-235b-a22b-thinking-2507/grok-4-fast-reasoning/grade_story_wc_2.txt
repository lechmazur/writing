<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (rigid time vs. craving uncertainty) drives choices, but "uncertainly certain" label appears twice without embodied cost escalation; final endurance earned though cavern escape lacks visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: compass pocketed amid collapsing rocks crystallizes acceptance of uncertainty with palpable physical danger; Accumulative lens holds as coincidence pattern tightens into decisive action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse moss and compass rose constrain choices (vine harness, etching map); bioluminescent fungi charge the final image. Over-reliance on "swirling" descriptors slightly dilutes sensory hierarchy during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (embracing uncertainty) tightens when cavern collapse forces improvisation; cost legible via near-burial. Secondary stake (father's legacy) lacks integration, slightly diffusing pressure during escape sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through compass rose's needleless design and Elias' final pocketing gesture—reconfiguring "direction" as potential rather than rigidity. Avoids moralizing but secondary father thread muddies focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tinkerer's gear-focused POV ("reluctant gears," "tarnished gold"); rhythmic control during waterfall descent. "Uncertainly certain" repetition slightly flattens voice under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "swirling leaves" repetition in high-pressure beat creates subtle cadence shift. "Damp earth and decay" overwriting in greenhouse entry slightly dulls immediacy without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker's precision with chaotic discovery; compass rose transforms trope through needleless design. Hedging on father's backstory slightly retreats from bold uncertainty premise.</comment>
