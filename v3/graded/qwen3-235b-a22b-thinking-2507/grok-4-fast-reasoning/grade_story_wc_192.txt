<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("hands trembled," "whispered voice a thread") with contradictory impulses (isolation vs. teaching), but companion remains abstract, weakening relationship crucible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: threshold stabilizes in "tender balance" with felt cost ("bridges burned to build better air"); Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric pressure buildup to final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (doorknocker ring) constrains choice during linking ritual; charcoal sanctuary described vividly but static, failing to charge final image beyond backdrop despite sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (teaching suffocation) deepens via encroaching shadows, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara executes pre-established ritual rather than adapting tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "scars as map not chain" motif, but final line explicitly states moral ("bridges burned to build better air"), triggering −0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("charred wood and forgotten fires") with rhythmic control, but "loaded emptiness" repetition creates cadence loops; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with concrete verbs ("slithering shadows," "ring warmed"), but synonym churn on "charcoal sanctuary" and "fading threshold" creates scaffold; no closure-beat artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "shadow keeper" archetype with tactile scar-ritual, though "burning bridges" trope risks familiarity; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional truth.</comment>
