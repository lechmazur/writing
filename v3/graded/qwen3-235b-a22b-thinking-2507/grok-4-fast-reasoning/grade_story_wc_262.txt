<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through unsaid loves mirroring Theo's, but "tears welled as Elara realized" uses label-heavy abstraction; emotional progression lacks embodied specificity at climax despite strong micro-choices like rewinding the strip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with felt cost in "tears welled" and thematic reconfiguration, but cost remains emotionally vague; Accumulative lens holds strongly through density increase, yet fails cost-proof test as no concrete price (e.g., physical sacrifice) is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Projection booth’s micro-setting constrains action (perching amid cables, splicing reels) and charges final image with "film strip clutched like a talisman," though recurring dust motes lack causal pressure on choices despite vivid sensory anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Theo’s letters deepening Elara’s search, with agency in singing the melody driving resolution; but cost remains abstractly emotional—no visible price like forfeited opportunity—limiting escalation’s tangible impact under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image of "goodbye letters became hellos to the self" reweights unused love through spatial metaphor without moralizing; theme emerges organically from ticket-stub letters and negative-space storage, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss with "incubated in regret."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spatially imaginative mind," "hushed thunder") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure, avoiding head-hopping while maintaining first-person consistency through vision sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "whispers of spectral screenings" and "tears welled" abstraction slightly dull momentum, but high density ("splicing reels under the same bulb") and closure propulsion ("film strip clutched like a talisman") avoid severe loop penalties despite two synonym-churn instances.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film negatives as love-storage via spatial metaphor feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "unused love" premise edges close to derivative without Theo’s ticket-stub specificity anchoring universality.</comment>
