<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied scars and black sand ritual; wanderer's sudden vulnerability lacks prior causality, slightly undermining shared-wound resonance despite strong final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: coin's "humming softly" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost; cloud migration arrival weakens pressure escalation slightly though lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains choice (black sand graft medium) and charges final "obsidian embrace"; volcanic specificity transforms setting from backdrop to thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("scars can sing") tightens through grafting action with visible cost; wanderer's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from grafting motif; final image reweights "scars can sing" without moralizing though "carry a tune" risks thematic echo narrowly avoided by character voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kelp-drift peace," firefighter's alertness) sustains under pressure; minor register drift in "resonant" slightly jars lyrical flow during high-stakes grafting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm with volcanic imagery density; "gracefully alert" repetition creates subtle scaffold loop in opening beat without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "scars to art" trope through volcanic grafting specificity; emotional truth avoids sentimentality though cloud migration timeframe feels derivative of nature-renewal conventions.</comment>
