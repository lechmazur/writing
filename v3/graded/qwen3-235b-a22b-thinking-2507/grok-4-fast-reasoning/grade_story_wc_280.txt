<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through synesthesia ("tasted of ash," "crimson ribbons"), but ghost remains archetypal; Eliza's shift from despair to hope lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal dance moment, weakening causal motivation for the closure's earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "fractured paths could realign" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost of impermanence ("encore granted in this shared reverie"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation ("echoes blooming into tapestries") without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: orchard's "lanterns swayed gently" directly enables the dance's visual language and closure's "garden's embrace." Sensory hierarchy perfectly filters through Eliza's synesthesia—jasmine scent triggers childhood memories that become active emotional fuel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("luring possibility from despair's brink") without tangible cost demonstration; ghost's "hunger for one more bow" creates secondary pressure, but resolution lacks visible price paid for the hope gained despite strong Accumulative escalation through layered echoes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through synesthesia-as-healing mechanism ("echoes blooming into tapestries"), not moralizing. Final image reweights "fractured paths" with conceptual cost of impermanence, though "buoy her spirit" edges toward sentimentality in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("tasted of ash," "crimson ribbons"), but "synesthetically blessed" introduces clinical register clash in peak beat. Ghost's voice as "swirling crimson ribbons" exemplifies rhythmic control under pressure with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "lanterns strung like fireflies swayed gently" weaves setting/action. One paraphrase loop ("navigated the maze by memory... by memory") deducts minimally; final line’s "fractured paths could realign" charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stage ghost + synesthesia + tarot coin creates emotional alchemy, but "vaudeville specter" leans on archetype. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—"sonic waves" transforming despair into "fireflies" feels inevitable through prior sensory groundwork.</comment>
