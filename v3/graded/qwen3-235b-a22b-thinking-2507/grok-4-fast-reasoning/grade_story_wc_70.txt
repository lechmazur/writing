<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' involuntary truthfulness drives authentic choices under pressure; his preservation-of-wonder motivation crystallizes in the matchbox ritual with embodied cost (restrained deception). Lira’s skepticism-to-curiosity shift lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: Lira’s ascent toward repair crystallizes options (fix the bees) with felt cost (city remains dark), all under Accumulative/Textural lens. Nectar dusk deepening perfectly reweights the blackout’s meaning through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lacquer box constrains Elias’ revelation method and charges the final image—its humming vents and matchbox etchings mirror the drone bees’ failure, transforming setting into thematic pressure. "Nectar dusk" sensory hierarchy flawlessly filters urgency through Elias’ wonder-preserving bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’ agency: his riddle ritual transforms abstract frustration into actionable insight (bee disorientation), narrowing options to repair. Cost is legible in Lira’s widened eyes—renewed curiosity replacing despair—but the blackout’s persistence lacks tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the matchbox’s physicality: "workers weave the city’s sum" reweights routine as sacred labor, avoiding moralizing. Final image (toll booth as "portal to enchantment") offers resonant answer to wonder’s necessity without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade><comment>Elias’ voice radiates through storm-patterned diction ("honey from a cracked comb") and stress-distorted rhythm during truth surges. Perceptual signature—filtering tower details through wonder—creates unmatched intimacy; no dialogue convergence despite tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</question><grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fireflies began their mimicry of lost power" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Only minor deduction: "frustration edging her tone" slightly over-tells Lira’s emotion where gesture could suffice in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><grade><comment>Transforms the "broken system" trope via bio-engineered bees—specific, verifiable detail (overharvested nectar) grounds the blackout’s cause. Risk-taking (riddle-as-revelation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making emotional truth inevitable.</comment>
