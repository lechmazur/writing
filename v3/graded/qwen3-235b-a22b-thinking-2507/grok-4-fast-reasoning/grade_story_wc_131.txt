<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Elias's methodical invisibility versus yearning to be seen, embodied in his tentative emergence and caching ritual. Flaw visibility lacks sharper tradeoffs in the final scene where risk feels underweighted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Earned Stasis closure lands with vulnerability cost as Elias kneels with the woman, but outage escalation lacks causal tightness—flickering lights intensify atmosphere yet fail to concretely narrow his options pre-emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library environment constrains choice (pipe chases force slow movement) and charges the final image: dawn's sapphire light transforms the hush from isolation to shared hope, reweighting the dominant stake through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias’s agency—memory crystallizes his resolve to cache hope—but the cost of visibility remains felt rather than viscerally dramatized; his emergence lacks tangible consequence beyond emotional risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the tape fragment’s sensory weight and "you are seen" note reconfigure invisibility as connective tissue, avoiding moralizing while resonating with earned ambiguity about quiet heroism’s limits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels (Elias notices "velvety silence" and pipe "ribs"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. Slight register drift in "sense memories weaving through his veins" edges toward lyric overwriting without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor scaffold in repetitive "methodical" usage and template cadence ("Elias moved... Elias navigated... Elias continued") slightly dulls propulsion in the discovery beat, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the crawl-space trope through magnetic tape’s specificity and "caching hope" as tangible action. Emotional truth in Elias’s quiet endurance avoids sentimentality, though the young woman’s role feels slightly convenient for closure.</comment>
