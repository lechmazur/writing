<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s synthetic identity crisis manifests through embodied micro-choices (trembling hands threading fracture) and contradictory impulses (craving connection while fearing isolation). Her earned closure—rejecting "certainty as cage"—is causally rooted in Lirien’s revelations without therapeutic labels. The relationship forces irreversible change with visible cost (dome failure).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cascading revelations deepen stakes through density shifts, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "certainty was the true cage" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (dome collapse imminent). Orientation clear by 80 words; lens inferred by midpoint with no ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden’s failing dome (micro-setting) actively constrains choices—threading the fracture requires precise pressure equalization—while the foxglove ampoule charges the final image (blooms swaying with "whispers of the surface"). Sensory details reflect urgency: bioluminescence guides Elara’s vision during high-stakes threading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elara’s threading action narrows options (escape vs. total collapse) after revelations deepen the core stake (artificial soullessness). Cost is visceral—bubbles rushing through the fracture signal impending doom—while the foxglove’s duality (life/death) sharpens moral calculus without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ampoule’s evolving symbolism: digitalis heart mirrors Elara’s synthetic pulse, culminating in a non-literal final image where "lifeless blooms sway" to reweight "certainty as cage" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity lingers via the garden’s "gentle defiance of the depths."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal arches of ancient coral," "quartz veins like hidden arteries") filters urgency through Elara’s synthetic lens. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("cascading truths began to unfold" → "trembling hands" threading), with telepathy avoiding dialogue clichés. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-duplicate scaffolding ("cracked something within; now, cascading truths began to unfold") slightly dulls propulsion in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise strong density: "foxglove-stained glass ampoule" conveys toxicity and function economically. Final image ("breathed anew") avoids figurative muddle but scaffolding prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater ruins + synthetic identity + telepathic crystals avoids trope pitfalls through specific logic (digitalis elixir, quartz thread). Bold risk in conceptual closure (Charged Poise over physical escape) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swapping "garden" for "forest" would break pressure mechanics.</comment>
