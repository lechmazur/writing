<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority risks abstraction ("gravitational longing") but micro-choices (aligning astrolabe, surrendering) concretely manifest motivation; emotional progression layers contradiction (feverish urgency vs. rest) though "caged bird" verges on cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: surrender shatters the cage with visible cost (years of barren canvases); Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure, though the "cage shatter" image slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (tracing stars) and charges final image ("archway stood sentinel"); mossy ground and astrolabe tactility ground the lyricism, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing creativity) tightens via tracing→surrender sequence; pressure grows through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, but the cost of creative block remains slightly underweighted in the breakthrough moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from stardust motif reweighted at closure ("paint with the dust of stars"); avoids moralizing, though "scattered but whole" edges toward thematic echo in the meteor's confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veils of green and violet light dancing") modulates with emotional intensity; lyrical compression taught early pays off, though "fever of nocturnal visions" risks register drift toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level density excels but "unspoken words" repetition and "shadowed rapture" reuse create subtle synonym loops; "comet's tail" metaphor slightly overwrites the pivotal breakthrough beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "creative block" trope through cosmic specificity ("remembered stardust" as literal essence); risks abstraction yet gains freshness via astrolabe mechanics and unwritten calendar time pressure.</comment>
