<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "bold sympathy" manifests concretely in proposing the search and insisting on the crater descent, with her marsh-reed craft directly enabling the resolution. Contradictory impulses (isolation vs. belonging) act simultaneously in her hesitation at the arbor and final integration, earning the closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara's dedication grafts her into the community, with the persistent "luminescent ache" providing undeniable conceptual cost. The causal lens holds tightly: her proposal leads to the search, descent, discovery, and integration, with Lir's hesitation at the crater descent narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor and reed tools constrain choices—the arbor's crevice requires physical discovery, while Elara's reed lantern enables the crater descent. The final image of "webs enduring" charges the recurring crystal motif, fulfilling the 9+ gate by having the environment shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Lir hesitates at the crater descent, forcing Elara's "sympathetic insistence" to narrow options. The cost—enduring the "luminescent ache" of lost languages—is legible in the final line, though the descent's escalation could feel slightly more urgent under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tag's discovery and Elara's weaving, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights "webs of kinship" as enduring despite loss, offering a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor thematic echo in "kinship, once elusive... now held her fast" slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature ("callused hands," noticing crystal refractions) and rhythmic control under pressure ("her motivation blooming like a reed") create distinct voice. Lir's dialogue carries subtext ("It spoke of our webs"), with psychic distance shifts intensifying the discovery moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose shows high density and varied rhythm ("iridescent mists rose from the crater's depths"), but minor overwriting in "luminescent ache of exclusion, a glowing sorrow that lit her path but weighed her steps" slightly dilutes momentum in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "webs" as kinship metaphor within a crystalline setting feels inevitable. The risk of lyrical tone heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity, with "luminescent ache" transforming generic sorrow into a charged, irreplaceable motif that reweights the finale.</comment>
