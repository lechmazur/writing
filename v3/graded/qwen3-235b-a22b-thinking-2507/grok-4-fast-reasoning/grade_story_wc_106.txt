<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (thief vs guardian) but "luminous disbelief" edges toward diagnostic label-speak in peak beats; final choice earned by prior decoding of floral code.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost (identity transformation) under Accumulative/Textural lens; vendor's appearance slightly convenient but moonbeam revelation reweights destiny's cost decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emerald Station constrains choices via sunset deadline and moonlight transformation; micro-setting of flower arrangement actively guides movement toward alcove, charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as golden hour wanes, deepening into identity cost when moonbeams reinterpret portrait; agency fully Elara's with visible price paid in final vanishing act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "illuminated moments" redefined by moonbeam revelation; final image ("guardian of illuminated moments") resonates without moralizing, reweighting theft as sacred duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet-draped easel," "cobblestones") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "luminous disbelief" slightly dilutes pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion but opening cadence ("steps silent... mind a vault") shows template repetition; no artifacts in closure beat preserves momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope via floriography mechanics and moonbeam physics; emotional specificity in identity shift avoids generic wonder, feeling inevitable through prior details.</comment>
