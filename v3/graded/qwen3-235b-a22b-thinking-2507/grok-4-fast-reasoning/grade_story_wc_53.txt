<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "regretted it all now" versus resolute scavenging, with embodied choices like pocketing damp fragments. Slight abstraction in "hollow ache" prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-choices during ghost bargaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: ghost's nod reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("weaving regrets into new narrative"). Orientation anchored by 40 words, lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through kinetic stir at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon constrains every action—gravity-defying pools, suspended droplets—and charges the final image. Micro-setting (camera wheel) directly alters tactics; "dripping condensed mist" embodies pressure without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (negotiating with ghost) tightens through protagonist's agency: bargaining with fragments forecloses path with visible cost (ghost fading). Pressure deepens via accumulation, though ghost's resolution edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "weaving regrets into new narrative" reweights ambition without moralizing. Final image (resolute in quiet aftermath) answers central question through action, avoiding thematic echo despite near-miss phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whispers carried snippets of overheard stories," with rhythmic control ("years—or was it moments?"). Slight abstraction in "hollow ache" prevents 9.0, but compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dripping condensed mist" layers texture without muddle. Deducted 0.4 for "hollow ache" (diagnostic phrasing in peak beat per rubric), but propulsion remains flawless through final negotiation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carousel trope via kinetic physics and camera wheel. "Disposable" object transforms ambition's cost, but ghost motif slightly familiar. Risk-taking (textural escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
