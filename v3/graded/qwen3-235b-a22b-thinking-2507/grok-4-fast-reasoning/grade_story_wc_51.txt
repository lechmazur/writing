<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (collecting burdens to counter fractal curse) but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "recursive scars" show struggle yet final choice feels unearned without visible cost escalation beyond abstract "glimpsed release." No contradictory impulses act in scene during pivotal calcification moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no exact sentence/image where price is felt beyond atmospheric "reverie thicker than bone." Accumulative lens holds but density increase fails to reweight stakes; gathering burdens deepens without narrowing options or altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bronze grotto’s fractal veins actively constrain burner orientation ("aligning flame with starlight’s angle and fractal vein"), charging the calcification beat. Final image’s cooling burner gains resonance from earlier copper-vein specificity, satisfying 9+ gate via micro-setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing self via burden-collection) tighten through calcification mechanics, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; Elara’s methodical repetition narrows options only abstractly. Cost remains conceptual ("dense pull of lost companionship") without tangible forfeiture altering later tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><comment>Theme emerges organically from "weights of burdens" motif, but final "map of human frailty" risks thematic echo. Avoids moralizing yet closure’s "glimpsed release" lacks non-literal reweighting—conceptual repricing feels undercharged by absence of concrete cost in the final image.</comment><grade>7.8</grade>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("shingled hush layered like overlapping roof tiles") with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping, but "whalebone reverie" lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("pale and unyielding as whalebone carved from deep-sea dreams") during high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "veined with oxidized copper that gleamed like ancient armor, curved in endless, self-similar patterns that mirrored the stars" stacks two similes, muddling physical logic. Template cadence ("She lifted... her movements... orienting it...") triggers -0.4 penalty in closure-adjacent section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fractal geometry with emotional burdens avoids tropes through "spider-silk fractal" pouches and "calcify" mechanics. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for short form) heightens stakes, but "boundary-lessly trapped" leans derivative without sufficient transformation of the entrapment trope.</comment>
