<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied choices: child net-untangling memory directly enables kelp escape. Flaw: "motivation burned fierce" risks abstraction but saved by concrete oxygen-depletion stakes. Contradictory impulses (panic vs calm) act simultaneously in entanglement scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: oxygen alarm wailing during kelp release crystallizes endurance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—sensory density (hush, silt, kelp) escalates pressure without causal breaks. Orientation clear by "crumbling stone ledge" (line 3).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (oxygen gauge) constrains every choice: "flickering red" → "air reserves teetered on empty" → rescue timing. Temple’s coral columns evolve from "silent sentinels" to "fading glow," charging final image. Body-as-setting (gloved palm warming vial) directly enables solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via vial’s unsealing: kelp entanglement narrows options to patience vs panic. Cost legible in oxygen alarm during escape—rescue arrives as reserves hit critical. Agency shines in overriding instinct, but "as time runs short" lacks precise clock escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial’s residue: "ephemeral" reweighted from abstract goal to tangible memory-tides. Final image (smiling with vial) answers central question without moralizing. Avoids "lonesome splendor" echo by transforming it from isolation to "intimate power" in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "fractured shafts gilding ruins" filters light through urgency. Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during entanglement. No dialogue, but internal rhythm ("tears blurred vision, but not from sorrow alone") sustains tension without filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero synonym loops; "crystal perfume vial" → "talisman against void" shows purposeful reprise. Mild overwriting risk ("lonesome splendor" twice) offset by earned closure charge. Final line’s "captured fragment" crystallizes motif without abstraction. Oxygen gauge’s concrete "red flicker" anchors climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms temple trope via "gathered hush" concept: kelp as living snares ties memory-attribute to physical stakes. Emotional truth in salt-laced floral essence triggering specific, flawed recollections (mother’s laughter now "silenced by years"). Avoids safety-middle with moral ambiguity in "stealing secrets."</comment>
