<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns clearly but interiority leans abstract ("burned like a hidden ember"); embodied choices under pressure (cradling shell, accelerating bow) earn stakes, though emotional contradiction lacks visceral layering in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dissolving locust shell ("purpose fulfilled") and statues crumbling manifest undeniable cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through music's density shift from "resonantly soft" to "symphony," reweighting stakes via organic escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orchard's sensory details (rusting fruits, brittle cogs) vividly anchor setting, but micro-setting fails to constrain choices; the sky-bridge functions as stage rather than tactical constraint, missing 9+ gate despite strong atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: her heart-rhythm signaling narrows options as statues freeze, with visible cost in the shell's dissolution; escalation peaks via music's intensifying vibration, foreclosing mechanical order through earned reawakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from locust shell symbolism to "breaking free as rebirth"; final image ("beauty, pure and untamed, reclaimed") reweights prior material without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice carries distinct perceptual signature ("stone eyes gleaming with unnatural vigilance"), but elevated diction ("liminal place") occasionally drifts from POV lexicon; rhythmic control falters slightly in repetitive "resonantly soft" phrasing during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in music descriptions ("resonantly soft" x3) and overwriting ("gentle vibration that seeped like morning dew") create subtle momentum drag; otherwise strong density and propulsion, with closure image ("scattering like fireflies") escaping artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological resistance via artistic ritual avoids trope recycling; risk-taking in heart-rhythm signaling heightens stakes coherently, though "tarnished wonder" leans slightly toward familiar aesthetic without sufficient transformative grit.</comment>
