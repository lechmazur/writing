<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (escape vs. rebuild) with embodied choices, but "reimagine civilization" motivation lacks sufficient friction; micro-choices like pocketing the vial earn closure though cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as lanterns relit with algae reconfigure the bottle's legacy; cost is legible in "relic of what was" and conceptual shift from magic to sustainability under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Docks' bioluminescent algae and amber bottle constrain choices (replacing fire/wishes) and charge the final image; sensory details like "salt-crusted windows" and "fishermen's chants" evolve with the protagonist's resolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival vs. abandonment) tightens through Elias' memory work, but escalation lacks tangible cost during conception; doubts are dismissed too easily despite "shadows" imagery weakening pressure in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>Theme emerges through bottle-to-algae transformation rejecting "false comforts," with final image ("true revival came from within") offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite high-band risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV voice distinctively alchemical ("mental forge," "soil recipes memorized"), but "working memory" repetition creates subtle convergence; rhythmic control under stress weakens during conception sequence with template cadences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose shines in atmospheric descriptions ("fog-shrouded docks," "glowing life"), but paraphrase loops ("rejecting false comfort" x3) and "mental forge" metaphor repetition dull momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alchemy-meets-sustainability angle transforms ghost town tropes, but "reimagine civilization" motivation feels grandiose; specific details like desert nomad soil recipes provide verifiable freshness without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
