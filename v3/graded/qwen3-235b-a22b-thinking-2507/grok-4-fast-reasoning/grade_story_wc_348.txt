<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("grief like a taut string"), with embodied contradiction in "symphonically minded" trait driving authentic choices. Final call earned through polymer/river metaphor synthesis without therapy-speak, though "atone" borders on clinical label briefly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the phone call crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("grief loosening on both ends"). Orientation solid by para 2, but foam-to-insight transition slightly rushed, missing one micro-choice in the deepening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine functions as essential micro-setting—the river's foam patterns directly constrain Elena's reconciliation tactic. Recurring chrysalis charges the final image ("promise of emergence"), fulfilling the 9+ gate by reweighting separation through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending estrangement) signaled early and viscerally felt through "chasm wider than any ravine." One meaningful deepening (river observation reframing separation) narrows options under Accumulative lens, though escalation lacks a second pressure point to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through polymer/river/chrysalis motifs; final image reweights "divergent path" as "symphony of second chances" without moralizing. Daughter’s soft laugh provides resonant, non-literal answer to estrangement, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded" scientist) permeates voice, with rhythmic control heightening pressure ("words flowing like reunited streams"). Minor register drift in "atone" briefly clashes with emotional lexicon, but payoff justifies the term.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels through concrete verbs ("tracing," "uncoil," "hum"). Figurative language precise in peak beats ("foam patterns" reframing separation), with final line recharging chrysalis motif flawlessly. No artifacts dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry and musical grief reframes "divergent path" through specific, verifiable detail (braided hydrology). Emotional risk of the call avoids safety middle, with chemist’s observational lens transforming a familiar estrangement arc into inevitable insight.</comment>
