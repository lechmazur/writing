<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically through chain handling and trembling hands, with micro-choice (pocketing envelope) altering present stance. Epiphany slightly unearned as adhesive analysis resolves conflict too neatly despite strong embodied emotion ("trembled in his grasp, or perhaps it was his hands").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: tremor-induced pebbles "like applause" crystallize options with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through volcanic breaths and adhesive analysis; cost proof evident in final image reconfiguring chain's meaning without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic breaths constrain choices (measuring shifts due to tremors) and charge closure via "steadied breath" approval. Environment directly shapes tactics—tremor dislodges envelope, fissures guide chain placement—fulfilling micro-setting gate with irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs through adhesive discovery, narrowing options as historical plea for mercy forces floodgate redesign. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in identity shift. Minor deduction for "slyly heartfelt" feeling slightly forced rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through envelope cipher mechanics and chain symbolism. Final image ("pact with mountain's secrets") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity of engineering ethics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("subtle shifts," mineral scents) and rhythmic control shine, but "slyly heartfelt" label repetition creates minor register drift. Voice modulates effectively from technical ("spectrometer") to poetic ("dappled resolve") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops, though "yellowed and cracked like old scars" risks mixed metaphor. Template cadence appears near climax ("Elias stood... Elias felt..."). No closure artifacts, but minor scaffold in transitional phrasing prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of engineering ethics with volcanic amphitheater creates fresh pressure cooker. Adhesive cipher method transforms trope through specific lived detail, though "dormant volcano" setting leans slightly familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
