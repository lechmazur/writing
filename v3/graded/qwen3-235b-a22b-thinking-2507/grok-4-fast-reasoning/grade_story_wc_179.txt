<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("resentment must be released, not harbored") in peak beat undermines embodied emotion; Thorne’s micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during pivotal shift despite strong motivation clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost (Thorne’s tears/reality stabilizing) under Accumulative lens; Orientation Test passed via early sanctuary anchoring; no causality breaks in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (touch-based method) and charges final image; recurring music box reweights meaning at closure, satisfying 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens with visceral cost (Thorne’s emotional unraveling), but tightening lacks visible trade-off beyond internal state; dominant stake (resentment vs. peace) intensifies coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cellular memory mechanics rather than moralizing; final "peace bloomed" image offers non-literal resolution to resentment question without stated moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shifting grace," "cellular memory" lexicon) modulates under pressure, but elevated diction in peak beats ("imprints etched into the very cells") slightly disrupts POV plausibility for a monk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("reappearing when needed most to mend what hatred had torn") creates density drag; no closure-impacting loops but rhythmic uniformity in middle section reduces propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "soundless sanctuary" and cellular memory transforms pacifist trope; risk-taking in tactile empathy mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "shifting grace" concept borders on abstraction.</comment>
