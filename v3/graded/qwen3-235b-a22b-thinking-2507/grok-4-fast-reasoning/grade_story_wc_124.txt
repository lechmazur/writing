<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through sensory triggers; "trembling fingers" uncorking vial shows contradictory impulses (caution vs. need to understand). Elara flashback integrates flawlessly with present action, avoiding therapy-speak. Slight abstraction in motivation ("gnawing motivation") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: kneeling amid crystal shadows with earned realization about "sensory anchors" carries undeniable cost (open grief). Orientation established by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through UV-triggered memory cascade. Holographic projection risks coincidence but justified by greenhouse's alchemical rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices: bioluminescent threads guide Elias' movements, UV light enables the climax's holographic revelation. "Crystal shadows" evolve from metaphor ("forgotten regrets") to physical reality charging the final image. Micro-setting (vial facets casting prismatic shards) directly shapes his sensory experience during the key beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: his choice to inhale despite being "aromatically cautious" triggers the memory flood. Cost is visceral (tears as mending fractures) and alters his approach to grief. Escalation driven by sensory accumulation under UV light, though the reborn flower's timing edges toward external catalyst rather than pure protagonist pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through vial's effect: "sensory anchors" insight crystallizes via Elara's holographic peace, not abstraction. Final line ("scent wept for us... mending wistful fractures") reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite Q9C element integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: lantern broker's sensory lexicon ("vessels for captured scents," "ghostly fragrances") permeates voice. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Tears welled, unbidden"). Zero head-hopping; UV light's "ethereal purple glow" filters through his wistful lens. Slight overwriting risk in "crystalline panes etched with frost-like veins" avoided by thematic relevance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; every phrase multiplies meaning ("crystal shadows fracturing into prismatic shards that played across his lined face" embodies grief). Propulsion flawless: UV flicker accelerates to "pod quivered and split." Peak beat ("scent wove through him... key turning in lock") avoids figurative muddle with concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via lantern broker lens and UV botany. "Scent as bridge to raw essence of loss" feels fresh through alchemical specificity. Holographic Elara projection risks sci-fi but grounded in greenhouse's rules. Emotional truth anchors novelty, though hologram concept lacks full transformation of familiar tropes to justify 9.0+.</comment>
