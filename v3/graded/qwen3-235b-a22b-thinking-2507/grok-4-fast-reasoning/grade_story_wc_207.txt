<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows petrichor obsession as motivation, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "sensibly eccentric" trait stated twice without visible tradeoffs during the compass discovery. Final endurance feels earned but micro-choices lack layered conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: compass becomes "new vial" with conceptual cost (sacrificing pure scent for mystery), resonant hush reweighted in final line. Orientation perfect within 100 words, but psychometry reading lacks causal struggle to activate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon functions as micro-setting: slick walls force physical squeezing, obsidian water reflects lantern, dripping creates "resonant hush" charging the final image. Every detail pressures choices or embodies the central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("place where explanations failed") clear early, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation; compass discovery deepens mystery without narrowing options or raising cost. No tangible consequence for her choice to "delve no further."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: petrichor collection evolves from rebellion to "awakenings hinged to mystery" in final image. Avoids moralizing, but psychometry tool feels slightly convenient for thematic delivery without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "resonant hush" motif weaves through syntax ("dripping water," "hush even her breaths," "hush enveloping her"). Rhythmic control shifts from flowing descent to staccato in narrow passage, voice consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but "hinged awakening began, the first pivot swinging open like a door" mixes metaphors (hinges vs. door), slightly muddling the peak beat. Minor synonym churn in "resonant hush" repetitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of petrichor rebellion and psychometry in limestone quarry setting. "Sensibly eccentric" trope transformed through specific tactile details, but lost expedition compass leans slightly on familiar mystery tropes without full transformation.</comment>
