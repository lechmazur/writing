<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "affectionate detachment" is clear but lacks visceral embodiment during transformation; "widower's grief subsumed her detachment" risks abstraction without physicalizing the emotional shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "affection bloomed without distance—detached no more" crystallizes the irreversible loss of professional armor amid dusk's fading light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains choice (dusk deadline for transformation) and charges closure: its "half truth" glow mirrors Elara’s evolved authenticity, with crumbling petal sealing the environmental payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via scent-triggered memories, but pressure lacks tangible escalation; the "surge" feels internal without altering tactics beyond the premeditated transformation test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Half truths" theme resonates through petal’s chemistry and grotto’s fading light, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights authenticity as "fused wholeness" without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in scent/static synesthesia; rhythmic control peaks during transformation ("static prickled her fingertips... surge built, electric"), with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or muddle, but "static electricity" repetitions verge on template cadence in climax; "joy laced with loss" slightly over-tells where sensory immersion could deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scent-based emotion counterfeiting avoids tropes, yet "static truth" mechanic feels familiar; specificity in amber grotto and blotter petal rescues from abstraction.</comment>
