<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as Elias shifts from copyist to conduit; embodied emotion in "quill hovering" and "heart quickened" avoids abstraction. Final choice earned by prior causality with cost of narrative famine made visible in dust-covered scores.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "dust now hummed with potential" crystallizes options with conceptual cost of famine's legacy. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in dust imagery; orientation clear by "ember alcove" at 42 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember alcove functions as micro-setting charging final image: "swirling motes" constrained Elias's dust-sprinkling choice. "Thistles" recur with purpose—prickly persistence mirrors stubborn revival—avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elias follows broadcast instructions, narrowing options to clandestine dust animation. Cost of narrative drought made visceral in "dust settling on scores, muting the notes like unspoken regrets" before revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust's transformation—"humming with potential" reweights famine's void without moralizing. "Teach dust to tell stories" integrates with plot; avoids thematic echo via concrete particulars like "whispers of lost symphony."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Elias notices "thistled calm" and "secretly luminous" particles. Rhythmic control peaks in broadcast sequence ("static crackled like distant thorns"); no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "dust learned quickly" slightly anthropomorphizes but fits magical realism. Avoids scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or character—though "thistled calm" repetition borders on motif overuse in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dust as story vessel transforms "story famine" trope through specific, humble mechanics. Emotional truth in revival via "overlooked remnants" avoids abstraction; premise inseparable from Elias's copyist role.</comment>
