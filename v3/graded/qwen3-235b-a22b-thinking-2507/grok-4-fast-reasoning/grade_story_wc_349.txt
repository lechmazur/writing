<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in quantifying voids while seeking story origins is concrete, but orphan backstory lacks embodied specificity during incision; micro-choices under pressure (selecting slate, tallying absences) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (moonlight's essence released), but the void-tallying mechanism risks abstraction; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with density increase reweighting "what lacks" as creation's origin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard setting actively constrains choice (scattered slates enable discovery) and charges final image; "cloud-forged crystal" tool shapes tactics, though cloud-sea metaphors occasionally verge on overextension without sufficient physical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (incising voids), but "seventeen voids" tally feels arbitrary rather than pressure-driven; conceptual cost (releasing moonlight's essence) legible yet lacks visceral weight during pivotal incisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "quantifying absence" ritual, with final image reweighting voids as story genesis; avoids moralizing but "glimmering parole" concept risks near-thematic echo in "absolution from fragmented past."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through character-particular noticing ("leaves that whispered secrets"), with rhythmic control intensifying during incision; no head-hopping, though abstract terms like "parole" slightly distance focalization under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "fracturing into tiny motes that floated free, integrating like parole granted" stacks metaphors, muddling closure image; propulsion otherwise flawless with concrete verbs ("incise," "tally," "shivered").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "quantifying absence" as story genesis feels inevitable; risk-taking (Accumulative lens, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry, though "bottled moonlight" borders on familiar magical realism trope without sufficient transformation.</comment>
