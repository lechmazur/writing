<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("body humming with unfamiliar rhythms"), but euthanasia tourism motivation lacks visceral causality; parasol tip's micro-choices anchor change credibly at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "sound of approaching endings" transforms from obsession to acceptance during storm rescue, reconfiguring her stance with the parasol's warmth as earned image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina constrains every choice (shifting floes, trawling nets); lace parasol tip evolves from anchor to sail, charging the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency—trawling debris, guiding families—until the storm forces crystallization; cost is visceral in her transformed hearing of endings as "gentle unfurling" during rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "fold in patience" reweights via Kai's recording and storm climax, avoiding moralizing; "windborne solace" motif charges closure without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("floes clattered like forgotten thoughts") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control in storm sequence avoids lyric drift; no head-hopping in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("sifting for auditory harbingers amid wind's soft laments"); single "windborne solace" repetition is pattern-taught, not scaffold. Figurative language sharpens climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief and euthanasia tourism avoids tropes through specific sensory logic; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
