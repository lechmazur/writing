<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on physics jargon as emotional buffer; "bleak exhilaration" label lacks embodied contradiction. Final choice earns cost through prior causality but micro-choices under pressure feel sparse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (pools as traps), but escalation lacks one tightening beat. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; orientation clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Geode crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging final image ("intangibly tangible hope"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency; observatory sways with winds during crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weaponizing unused potential) tightens via crystal's awakening, but cost legibility falters—Elias's "hollow laugh" lacks visceral consequence. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through geode's transformation (joy→weapon), but "pools as traps" insight leans on exposition. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, yet complexity feels undercooked.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("perturbation theory" as grief lens) with rhythmic control; stress compresses diction cleanly. No head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical to visceral during crystal pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Figurative density muddles peak beats ("intangibly tangible" repetition); final-third "unfiltered truth pooling" triggers artifact cap. Propulsion strong but scaffold in circuit-breaker descriptions dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics grief and vengeance; drone-strike wedding transformed via geode conduit. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "unused potential" premise borders on familiar.</comment>
