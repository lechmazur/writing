<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (sail adjustment to muffle hum) reveal Elias's hierarchy of values; Lira's embodied grief ("shoulders ease") avoids label-only emotions. Contradictory impulses—silence as void versus balm—drive the closure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lira's eased shoulders crystallize the reconfiguration of silence with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds through noise-monitoring escalation to storm response, with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm glass vial (tool) constrains choices (Elias acts when crystals form) and charges the final image ("quiet held, a lesson etched in the ether"). Prism terrace hums underfoot, integrating setting with tactile action during pivotal storm sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single deepening—storm rumble forcing mist release—narrowing options under Accumulative lens. Elias's agency (catalyzing calm) pays the cost (averted tempest enabling Lira's solace), avoiding coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights silence as active comfort ("lesson etched in the ether"), avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates through vial's mist ("fragrance of rain-kissed stone") and Lira's whisper, resisting thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elias's perceptual signature ("subtle pulse of the air," noise monitoring) creates distinct rhythmic control. Voice modulates under pressure (lyrical hush to crisp action verbs during storm), with taught elision (train's departure) paid off in transit focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via precise verbs ("nudged," "splintered"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("terrace receding like a shattered mirror"), with no muddle in peak beats. Final line recharges motif without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of aerial gondola operator + storm glass reframes silence as craft. Emotional specificity in "satchel of forgotten maps" avoids generic grief, while risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
