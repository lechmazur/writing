<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (tradition vs evolution) is embodied through plant telepathy micro-choices, but flaws lack visible struggle; "insurgent spirit flared" risks diagnostic label-speak without layered cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (entombed destiny vs co-creation), but orientation delay past 120 words ("Elder Mira... insurgent grandmother") triggers −0.4 orientation penalty without payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Volcanic setting creates vivid atmosphere but rarely constrains choices; sulfurous mists and lava tools appear without altering tactics, failing Q3's 9+ gate requirement for environmental pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evolving tradition) tightens via decoding/unsealing, but cost remains conceptual; no visible trade-off during embryo release (e.g., physical toll or immediate backlash) weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "pruning roots" motif, but final paragraph's explicit "destiny not imposed but co-created" violates Q5's anti-pattern for thematic echo in closing lines, triggering −0.7 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (geothermal rhythms through plant whispers) sustains voice, though tense shifts ("had once gripped," "began to stir") slightly blur focalization during high-pressure unsealing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line propulsion falters in reconstruction descriptions ("bathhouses and geothermal pipes amid sulfurous mists"); minor synonym loops ("fragile tapestry woven from ash and hope"/"reconstruction would transform—not just stone and steam") reduce density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcanic ecology and cultural evolution avoids tropes, but "implanted destiny" embryo concept leans on familiar bio-engineered savior tropes without sufficient transformation through Mira's specific flaws.</comment>
