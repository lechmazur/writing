<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("orphaned youth" trauma vs. present transformation) drives credible change; embodied "scarred hands" detail and scaffold-reading micro-choice earn closure. Slight abstraction in "sculpt possibility" motivation prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: playing on the arch crystallizes options with visible cost ("disbelief yielded to luminous dawn"). Accumulative lens holds via scaffold/flutter pattern; cost legible in transformed stance at final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (scaffold wraps) constrains choice by mapping the path; glass flake's "luminous glow" charges the final image. Environment actively shapes tactics—no postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("never" of orphaned youth) tightens via scaffold flutter interpretation—a protagonist-driven deepening. Cost is visceral in the arch's "moss-veiled" confrontation with past failures. One tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "pixelated amnesty" motif reweighted by the flake’s final pulse; no moralizing. Ending’s "endless crossings" offers resonant non-literal answer to "never" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dynamically observant" fiddler’s ear/eye) controls focalization. Minor repetition of "luminous disbelief" causes slight register drift under pressure, capping near 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat but scaffolded "sculpt possibility" phrasing in mid-story creates synonym churn. High density otherwise; "pixelated as if etched by digital ghosts" risks figurative muddle yet pays off thematically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vanishing hitchhiker trope with photographic artifacts ("wet-plate collodion" meeting "pixelated"). Transforms safety-hedging into earned vulnerability via scarred hands backstory.</comment>
