<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation intensifies credibly through tactile tinkering; embodied contradiction in her whimsy versus urgent purpose ("whimsical hum" amid "heart thrummed with purpose") avoids label-speak. Villagers lack interiority but fit single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates to Earned Stasis closure where villagers’ chant rekindles practices with visible cost (emotional reawakening). Minor causality gap in vine tendril’s sentience mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arbor setting constrains every choice (loom placement, tendril behavior) and charges final image ("reverent murmur" in "renewed dawn"). Micro-setting mastery: vine’s "pulsing rhythm" directly enables the remedy’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring practices to save crops) tightens via song-weaving escalation, but external threat (withered fields) remains abstract; cost is emotional (villagers’ "rediscovered wonder") not tangible. Agency-driven deepening lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through golden threads as "remedy," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("sacred songs echoing forever") resonates non-literally, though "remedy" phrasing slightly echoes prompt. Complexity in honoring tradition without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tinkerer’s focus on textures ("coils of wire and petals") and sonic detail ("whimsical hum"). Rhythmic control peaks in weaving sequence, though "luminous orb" verges on ornamental abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("verdant arbor," "ancient grove") and overwriting ("dawn’s gold kissing the moon’s silver") dull propulsion. Strong closure image ("village would thrive") compensates; no critical artifacts in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tinkerer’s mechanical whimsy fused with ritual restoration. Specificity in "vine tendril as loom" transforms trope; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
