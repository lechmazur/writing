<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied trauma (sweat evaporating in UV light), but "mathematics of mercy" motivation risks abstraction; micro-choice of tightening strap reveals value hierarchy through physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: rising with "rooted pull of purpose" crystallizes options under Accumulative lens, with UV pain as undeniable conceptual cost; drive lens (memory accumulation) taught early and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>UV forest constrains every choice—path revealed only when Elias braces against bark, making environment indispensable to closure; sensory specificity (Braille-like bark texture) charges final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: trauma-triggered memories narrow options toward "mathematics" pursuit, with UV pain as visible cost; escalation peaks as memories force realization mercy follows patterns like "roots seeking water."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "mercy wasn't random" insight reweights UV penance as patterned suffering; final path walk offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—proprioception shapes UV sensitivity into "Braille of errors"; rhythmic control intensifies under stress (short sentences during memory surges) with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "displaced rootedness" and "Braille of errors" avoid purple prose through character-specific logic, though "relentless UV haze" slightly overwrites in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Mathematics of mercy" transforms interrogation tropes via cartographer protagonist; UV penance recontextualizes mercy as ecological pattern, avoiding safety-middle with bold conceptual risk that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
