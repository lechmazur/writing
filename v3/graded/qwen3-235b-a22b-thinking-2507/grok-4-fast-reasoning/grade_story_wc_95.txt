<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (violence vs. diplomacy) drive the foil practice and final choice; rival remains underdeveloped though "diplomatically fierce" trait lacks sufficient friction in their interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with felt cost (abandoning violent confrontation), but causality stumbles slightly in the anonymous ally's message—convenience undermines the "hidden overture's" organic emergence during the sundial alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brook and glass atrium constrain choices (light enables code-reading) and charge the final image ("glass walls trembling"); recurring needle card's physical properties directly enable the resolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as Elias shifts from solitary fencing to verbal negotiation, but escalation leans slightly on the external "anonymous ally" device rather than pure protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the needle/sundial code and "questions into destinations" philosophy; final image reweights without moralizing, avoiding the fatal "Thematic Echo" penalty in the rival's dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mechanical arm whirring," "dignified chaos") and rhythmic control under stress; single-POV interiority modulates perfectly from turmoil to crystallized focus during the foil practice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with vivid textural specificity, but minor metaphor clash ("symphony of whispers that clashed with the storm") and slight "diplomatically fierce" repetition create hairline textural muddle in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bold synthesis of dueling philosophy with coded artifacts feels inevitable; the needle card’s transformation from relic to diplomatic tool avoids gimmickry while heightening stakes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
