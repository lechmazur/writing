<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (shrewdness vs whimsy) drives micro-choices like envelope retrieval, but emotional progression feels tidy; Mira's reaction lacks layered conflict when locket reveals her lineage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with partnership proposal, but cost remains conceptual ("returns yet to come") rather than visceral; Orientation Test passed cleanly by 120 words with docks/symphony context.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket) constrains choice by triggering the meeting and charges closure through generational symbolism; "breezy library" pressure evident when wind enables envelope discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters with adjacent figurative overload ("violins humming"/"lanterns like fireflies"); verbatim "whimsically attentive" repetition creates a scaffold loop in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh cargo broker/archivist pairing transforms "quiet contributor" trope through tangible resource exchange, but emotional complexity avoids sentimentality without deepening beyond archetype.</comment>
