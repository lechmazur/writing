<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (sorrow/hope) embodied in jewelry-making; micro-choices like unfolding the lotus reveal values. Slight thematic echo in "wither no more" prevents 8.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: starlight parting curtains reveals resilience with felt cost (grief softening). Orientation clear by line 5; Accumulative lens held through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Timeless observatory constrains all choices (perpetual twilight enables star-gazing); recurring vellum charges closure when coordinates illuminate curtains. Micro-setting gate satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief-to-renewal) tightens through Elara’s agency: transforming vellum into talismans. Escalation via density increase (dusty relics → origami coordinates) reweights hope with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: unfolding origami literally parts "curtains of intention." Final galaxy vision offers non-literal answer to "blooming anew" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (jeweler’s tactile focus); rhythmic control in "time bent like light through a prism." Minor filter-verb stack ("began to understand") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; high density ("grief-worn skin"). One paraphrase loop ("mourning jewelry—lockets etched...") in early beats triggers −0.3 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: origami coordinates as celestial guidance transforms grief tropes. "Curtains of intention" concept avoids abstraction through tangible mechanics (starlight illumination).</comment>
