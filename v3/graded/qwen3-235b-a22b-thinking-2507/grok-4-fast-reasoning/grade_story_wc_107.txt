<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elias's theatrical narration ("primordial fire") masks despair, but "thoughtfully spirited" trait occasionally veers into authorial voice (e.g., "weighty lightness" feels imposed rather than embodied). Micro-choice with father's bookmark—tracing fissures while recalling debate—perfectly crystallizes motivation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: abandoning the forge forecloses safety with felt cost (sparking panels, pooling water). Lens ambiguity early ("Is this about glass or grief?") slightly delays Accumulative/Textural drive, but the melting ice's pressure tightening options by midpoint salvages cohesion. Cost proof solid in "could not remain chained to this ruin."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: melting ice forces movement, hoarfrost-covered consoles shape glassblowing, and the control room's instability directly causes abandonment. Final image of orbs "scattered across the waking world" charges the environment-as-crucible theme. Sensory hierarchy flawlessly mirrors urgency (e.g., "drip-drip of melting ice" narrowing focus during crisis).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically: crafting safe zones initially seems abstract until melting ice physically threatens the outpost, forcing Elias to choose mobility over stability. His agency drives escalation—spotting the bookmark triggers the realization that enables departure. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning the forge (tactic-altering loss) to preserve the vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: glass orbs as "sanctuaries for wandering thoughts" reweighted by the final scattering image, avoiding moralizing. But "thawing heart" concept risks abstraction when stated directly ("mirroring the core concept that had haunted him"); stronger when shown via actions (tracing bookmark fissures = emotional thaw).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glassblower’s tactile focus ("molten glass swirling like a captive storm") and rhythmic control under pressure ("rod of destiny" narration). Minor register drift when "thoughtfully spirited" intrudes as authorial lens, but voice modulation from theatrical to resolved ("heart thawed and light") earns high marks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "contemplative by nature and thoughtfully spirited in his every gesture" is a synonym loop. One density misstep: "the slow thaw of a world long encased, mirroring the core concept" tells instead of shows. Final line’s "melting wilds" avoids closure artifact, though "waking world" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "craftsman seeking redemption" trope through specific glassblowing mechanics and arctic decay. Fresh inflection: safe zones as physical orbs rather than metaphorical spaces. Avoids safety middle by making abandonment the only credible choice, though "thawing heart" concept leans slightly familiar without more granular emotional specificity.</comment>
