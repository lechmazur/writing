<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks active testing; "wisely adventurous" trait remains label-only without tradeoffs under pressure. Motivation clear but closure lacks visible cost—throne claiming feels unearned despite time pressure. Emotional embodiment strong ("bittersweet nostalgia") yet internal conflict stays theoretical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: flake dissolving at dawn crystallizes cost of restoration. Orientation clear by 80 words ("lore keeper in Neo-Eden"). Causal lens holds tightly—ruby flake activation directly enables stairway discovery. Sunrise deadline creates coherent pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices (sunrise deadline) and charges final image ("sunrise bloomed"). Bioluminescent fruits and ruby flake function as micro-settings that enable key actions. Sensory details ("impossible scent of blooming fruit") reflect urgency while avoiding checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring lost essence) tightens via sunrise deadline, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—Elara faces no meaningful opposition beyond time. Cost (flake dissolution) is visible yet emotionally thin; sunrise threat feels external rather than deepening internal conflict. One tightening suffices but lacks visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "bioluminescent code" fruits embody tension between organic/digital. Final image ("lore was alive, her sally a spark") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo though "futuristic nostalgia" repetition risks abstraction near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chrome future," "organic pulse") filters all description. Voice modulates effectively—lyrical during reflection, taut during ascent. Single-POV control flawless; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (throne approach), rhythm accelerates without sacrificing specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in climax ("visions flooding: orchards eternal") slightly dulls propulsion. Template cadence in "Her mind, a archive..." / "Clutched in her palm..." weakens early momentum. Zero loops in closure beat, but "futuristic nostalgia" repetition in final paragraph risks thematic echo. Information density remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cyberpunk and ecological restoration avoids genre clichés. "Bioluminescent code" fruits transform familiar tropes through specific world logic. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Lacks one bold inflection—sunrise deadline feels conventional despite strong execution.</comment>
