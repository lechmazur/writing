<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in resisting transformation while compelled by grief is concrete; "paradoxically steady" trait lacks visible tradeoffs despite embodied sorrow. Final choice earns closure but cost remains underdeveloped beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with spice ritual deepening pressure, but cost legibility falters: transformation’s physical/emotional price isn’t dramatized in closure beat ("reluctance clawed" precedes change, not during). Closure (Charged Poise) lacks unmistakable on-page cost evidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlit orchard actively constrains choices (spice ritual requires stellar environment); recurring jasmine petals charge final image. Micro-setting (spices) directly shapes tactics—crushing them initiates irreversible metamorphosis, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (reforging bond beyond death) tighten via spice ritual’s physical demands, but escalation lacks visible price: transformation costs (sheds humanity) aren’t felt in the act itself. Agency drives escalation, yet cost remains abstract despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spice ritual’s physicality ("saffron’s earthy glow... coiled around her"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("wolves in harmony") resonates non-literally with "metamorphosis" premise, though cosmic intimacy slightly overstates closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dew-kissed petals... paradox of fragility") filters moonlight through grief. Rhythmic control peaks in ritual description, though "cosmic intimacy" repetition risks thematic echo. Single-POV stability anchors pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in ritual sequence ("crushed between palms... mingled with floral whispers"). Minor overwriting in "luminous fruit, its branches twisting like lovers' arms" slightly dulls propulsion, but closure imagery remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic tropes (phoenix rebirth enabling spirit-conjuring) through specific sensory logic (spices as cosmic anchors). Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off, though "cosmic intimacy" phrasing edges toward abstraction.</comment>
