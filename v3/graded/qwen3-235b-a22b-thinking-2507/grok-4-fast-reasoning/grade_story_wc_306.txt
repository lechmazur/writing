<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "vulnerable yet guarded" duality, but "diagnostic label-speak" ("rigid certainties," "ethical fog") risks abstraction without sufficient embodied cost during peak doubt confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—unhooking doubt's "stifling hold" with wind carrying it away creates undeniable conceptual cost, though the Accumulative/Textural lens could better manifest pressure through physical stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard constrains choice and charges the final image ("filling with newfound depth"), transforming from void-reflector to nuance vessel with tactile specificity that elevates setting beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via wind chime interpretations ("partial steps, hidden opportunities"), but the dominant conflict lacks visceral escalation; Thorne's hired role feels untested, softening the cost of shedding doubt's "garment."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror's transformation, avoiding moralizing, yet "welcome nuance into my certainty" borders on prompt-like phrasing, risking thematic echo without deeper interrogation of compromise's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "salt-tang of waves" and "chimes sing in erratic harmony" sustains voice under pressure, though Thorne's dialogue ("sincerely insincere") slightly flattens into archetype during interpretation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line propulsion falters in high-pressure beats: "her words vulnerable yet guarded, like sharing a secret behind a locked door" uses redundant metaphor ("guarded"/"locked"), diluting momentum near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "conscience for hire" with wind-chime divination transforms tropes, but the lighthouse/city dichotomy lacks specificity, risking generic "escape" familiarity despite strong mirror shard innovation.</comment>
