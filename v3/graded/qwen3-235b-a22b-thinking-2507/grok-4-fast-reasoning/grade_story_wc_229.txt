<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "screaming tenderness" and trembling focus, but "quiet fury" edges toward label-speak. Final choice (recorking) earns proof with visible emotional cost, though Harlan's absence limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds as scent/vibration density builds pressure. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (emotional vulnerability), but Harlan's guidance resolution lacks sufficient struggle—feels slightly convenient after minutes of waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Night-blooming garden constrains the ritual's timing and method, charging the final scent image. Cobalt lighthouse anchors atmosphere vividly, though its physical presence doesn't pressure decisions beyond setting the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (proving whispers > shouts) signaled early, with pressure deepening through sensory accumulation. Cost (emotional exposure) is felt but under-embodied; the "warmth bloomed" resolution lacks visceral struggle against the sea's indifference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through scent-as-whisper metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("scent lingering like promise kept") reweights "screaming tenderness" without stating the thesis—resonant and earned through Elias's vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobalt tower like sapphire blade," scent symphony) modulates beautifully from lyrical dawn to tense ritual. Minor register drift in "vibrations of intent" phrasing slightly disrupts voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is crystalline but has two hairline slips: "screaming in quiet fury" creates contradictory embodiment, and "whispers that outdistanced thunder" slightly overwrites. Final line avoids cliché with "promise kept" resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of supernatural communication via scent/vibrations elevates familiar lighthouse trope. Specific details (nocturnal garden, cork runes) ground the premise, though the core summoning ritual lacks a truly non-obvious emotional twist.</comment>
