<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (face-blindness vs. empathetic art) drives choices, but "methodical nature turning canvases into maps" risks diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion strong in glove-retrieval of ribbon yet "dormant empathy" summary weakens micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sketch reveals killer's face through empathy with conceptual cost (ribbon's stain = victim's ink), but "mist parting as approval" slightly over-signals hope without sufficient emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry functions as essential micro-setting: mist obscures vision (mirroring face-blindness), ledge erosion forces sketch reconfiguration, and final "mist parting" charges closure—environment directly constrains choices and final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy) tightens via ribbon discovery → sketch reconfiguration, but escalation relies on thematic insight rather than protagonist agency; "pencil lanced" action drives change yet cost remains conceptual (emotional stirring) not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unifying opposites" motif (ribbon/ledge, joy/sorrow), but final line "rekindled empathy that binds us" veers toward thematic echo; avoids moralizing only by embedding insight in sketch act, narrowly escaping Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("furrowed hush," tactile focus compensating for face-blindness) modulates with pressure; "metronome to her thoughts" elegantly compresses time without scaffold, though "dormant empathy" reflection slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats, but "mist clung like forgotten regrets" risks mixed metaphor; "methodically she scanned... methodical hands" incurs minor synonym churn (-0.2) without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blind artist solving cold case through artistic method feels inevitable; quarry setting avoids generic "mystery locale" via tactile constraints, though "lance the apathy" risks cliché without sufficient risk distinction.</comment>
