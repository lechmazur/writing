<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation to "step beyond fate" lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; reversal of crystal orb shows determination but no visible internal struggle between desire and fear. Embodied details (tingling fingers, trembling hands) elevate specificity but fall short of 9+ quick test for conflicted agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "exhilaration born of bleakness" crystallizes cost through the spent yoyo and "sea's mournful sigh." Accumulative lens holds as tidal rhythm and light/dark imagery reweight fate's tyranny with undeniable conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hunger stone constrains choices via tide timing (must act before waves reclaim it), charging final image with "scars of past famines" transformed by radiance. Lighthouse functions atmospherically but fails 9+ gate as it doesn't actively alter tactics—Elias's descent occurs despite it, not because of it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when yoyo reveals stone's carvings as invocations, tightening options as tide rises. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing: wave urgency feels coincidental rather than arising from Elias's choices. Cost is felt ("soul forever changed") yet not unmistakably tied to specific agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "clocks rewinding regrets" and "fossilized light" avoid moralizing. Final image ("time bent... in dance of light against encroaching dark") reweights defiance without stating morals. Loses 0.1 for near-balance in "victory and doom" phrasing risking false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "barnacle-crusted boulders" and "clocks that spun counter clockwise," but "bleak exhilaration" recurs as conceptual label rather than embodied state. Rhythmic control wavers when tide descriptions repeat "exhale/inhale" motif without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level density excels ("fossilized light coiled like dormant veins") but "bleak exhilaration surged through him" uses stock verb "surged" during high-pressure orb reversal. Filter-verb echo in "Elias felt it: threads snapping" costs 0.3; avoids major artifact penalties as closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms fate-defiance trope through specific mechanics: hunger stone's famine scars becoming vessels for radiance. Risk-taking in counter-clockwise ritual pays off with "beam flickering counter clockwise into mist" as inevitable yet fresh final image. Emotional truth in "thrill laced with chill" avoids generic templates.</comment>
