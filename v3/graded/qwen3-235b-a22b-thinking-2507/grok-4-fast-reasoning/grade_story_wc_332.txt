<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief via pigment/light metaphors, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "cipher of longing" reads as abstract label not lived struggle. Brother backstory told not shown through present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: "some dreams were meant to run" crystallizes cost via luminous release. Orientation delayed past 120 words but pays off in whispering archipelago's closure role. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Watercolor palette functions as micro-setting that charges final image—ochres blooming like heartbeats constrain her method. Tide pools mirroring sky directly enable sunrise capture. "Hush of improbable beginnings" lacks temporal pressure though.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("capture dream") without concrete test; no meaningful tightening as sunrise attempt succeeds effortlessly. Agency passive until final realization. Non-closure accumulation cap: two distinct flaws (untested stakes + passive protagonist).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through light/pigment reprise: "luminous absence" becomes "gentle glow" without moralizing. Final line reweights "runaway dream" into generative force. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in palette's fading projection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "dawn crept like hesitant lover" and salt-air chemical scents. But "vitalizing" repetition creates template cadence in paragraphs 2-3. Voice modulates beautifully during sunrise capture sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax but "vitalizing" scaffold in paragraph 2 triggers -0.4. Purple prose risk ("grogan with tomes that only revealed truths") offset by precise darkroom mechanics. Final line's "painting the world even in absence" achieves resonant compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via light-painting mechanic; archipelago's whispers feel fresh as active pressure. But "golden spires/echoing laughter" leans generic. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry through Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
