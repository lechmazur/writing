<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's embodied grief ("darkness that had swallowed the light") shows contradictory impulses, but the guardian remains symbolic rather than psychologically complex; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation beyond the closure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost ("darkness had learned its lesson"), but the "half-spoken secret" timeframe lacks concrete pressure; Accumulative lens holds though escalation feels atmospheric rather than tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt dock functions as micro-setting through the dental mirror's light-refraction mechanics, charging the final image; selective sensory details ("wet stone and distant brine") constrain Elara's choices by enabling the guardian's ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief vs hope) signaled early with one meaningful deepening through light patterns; protagonist's agency in emotional shift earns closure, but pressure lacks visible escalation beyond the ritual's progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; stars/darkness metaphor evolves organically into "darkness was not an end but a canvas," reweighting prior material without stating theme. Slight risk in "teach darkness the value of stars" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised sky in hues of deep blue and silver") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor register drift in "spiralingly calm" slightly disrupts voice consistency during key ritual beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "spiralingly calm" creates adverbial clutter in a pivotal beat; no closure-adjacent artifacts though "stillwater tension" borders on thematic echo without sufficient embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through specific canal/stars imagery and dental mirror's healer-tool history, but silent guardian archetype feels familiar; risk in Accumulative structure elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
