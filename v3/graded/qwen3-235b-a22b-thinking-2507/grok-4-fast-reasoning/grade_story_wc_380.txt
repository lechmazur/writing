<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied action (clawing through soil, coffee ritual) shows contradictory impulses. Motivation to recover wife's memory compels high-stakes choices under gravity's pressure. Minor flaw: whale's intentional beaching revelation lacks sufficient causal groundwork in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands cleanly: pocketing wildflowers crystallizes options with visible cost (acknowledged grief). Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density in chamber. "Pockets of gravity" concept pays off causally during exhumation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Salt chamber constrains tactics (gravity pockets alter digging) and charges final image (flowers' scent in crystalline space). Micro-setting details like "crystalline soil" and "fractured rainbows" reflect urgency while avoiding symbolism. Meets 9+ gate via environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: gravity fluctuations narrow options during dig while memory loss intensifies emotional cost. Agency shines in coffee-ground ritual and exhumation. Cost is visceral (physical strain, grief flood) and legible in "hands clawing" under shifting weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image (pocketing flowers) offers non-literal answer to memory's nature without moralizing. Theme emerges through salt crystals storing memories like "echoes in amber," reweighted by whale's song resonating with gravity pockets. Avoids sentimentality via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dark whorls suggesting a grave of salt") and rhythmic control under pressure. Focalization stays tight; prose modulates from ritual calm to digging frenzy. Minor flaw: "gleaming silence" repetition slightly dilutes voice in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but has paraphrase loops: "gleaming silence" appears 4× with minimal variation, and gravity descriptions repeat similar phrasing. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but syntactic monotony in chamber descent slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory storage as geological process—gravity pockets transforming grief into tangible excavation. Emotional specificity (wildflowers' scent triggering flood) avoids tropes. Risk-taking (coffee divination) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
