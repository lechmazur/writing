<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is concrete (village trauma) and actions align (zigzag casting), but interiority leans abstract ("transliterating buried grief") with minimal embodied contradiction beyond cool-headed focus. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond internal resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "fractures mend" crystallizes emotional cost amid garden's sigh, with Accumulative/Textural lens holding through patterned chaos escalation. Constellations halting feels slightly convenient but reconfiguration charge remains undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as micro-setting: vibrating vines and silence-vines constrain Elias's tactics (zigzag avoids snarls), while the rail spike's "cold weight" charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy masterfully filters through sonic urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency—breath control and zigzag intensify against dissonant blooms—but cost remains internalized; garden's "sigh" implies ecological consequence yet feels underweighted against his personal resolution in this tight frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic particulars ("feral lullaby," transliteration glyphs), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "watchful stars" into earned stillness, though "primal silence that birthed all noise" risks thematic abstraction without sufficient prior grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thorny vines of echo," "blue light pulses") sustains under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical description to staccato action ("Deeper he reeled"), with purposeful elision taught early via constellations' "sleepwalking."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "vines curled and snapped" avoids scaffold, but "fractals of forgotten light" slightly strains metaphor coherence. Final image’s "warm with captured divinity" achieves crystalline specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: sonic garden transforms fishing tropes via "transliteration" mechanics, while "feral lullaby" embodies thematic tension. Risk-taking (sound as physical flora) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior logic.</comment>
