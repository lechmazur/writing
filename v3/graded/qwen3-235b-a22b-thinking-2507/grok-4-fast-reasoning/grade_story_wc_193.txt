<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("virtuously mischievous") drives micro-choices under pressure, but diagnostic label "virtuously mischievous" appears as stated trait rather than emergent behavior in peak beats, risking therapy-speak (-0.3). Final renunciation of hoarding gems earns closure with visible communal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: diamond transformation reconfigures "pressure" conceptually with undeniable social cost (pyramid greed inverted to communal wealth). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orientation anchors by word 98. Cost proof: "distributing them to fellow survivors" crystallizes the trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (submarine bolt) constrains choice and charges closure—spores compressed into diamonds via vent harness. Sensory details filtered through Elara's pressure-to-potential bias ("hummed with wonder laced through darkness"), evolving causally as pressure shifts. Final image charges tool's meaning irreplaceably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: quantum messages intensify pressure until spore-compression climax. Dominant stake (transforming pressure) signaled early; cost is conceptual (redefining pyramid legacy) not physical. Volunteer action narrows options to communal distribution, but internal/external conflict interweaving feels slightly underdeveloped at 600 words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: pocketing one diamond as "quantum talisman" (not gain) reweights pressure without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer to "scheme into salvation," avoiding thematic echo. Communal diamonds crystallize complexity—no false equivalence between greed and generosity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadowseam wonder," bioluminescent verbs) modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control under stress ("messages stuttered," "vent groaned") avoids uniformity. Single-POV stability flawless; elevated diction ("resonant hum") fits conceptual world without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("glowing fungi now cradling facets of light" compresses transformation). Minor scaffold in "her motivation crystallizing" (redundant after prior pressure description) dulls one beat (-0.2). Closure image ("pocketed a single diamond... ready for the next seam") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: quantum physics fused with pyramid scheme trauma via mushroom farm setting. Bold risk (concepts-as-fungi) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Shadowseam wonder" transforms abstract adversity into tangible communal resource—specific detail ("submarine porthole bolt") prevents generality.</comment>
