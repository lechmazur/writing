<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fleeing vs. bearing legacy) intensifies through embodied choices like handling fragile diaries; final renunciation of escape as burden earns closure via prior causality. Flaws remain authentic without hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with visible cost ("weight settled... heavier than ivy") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by 100 words; density escalation reweights stakes via negative's revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy passage actively pressures movement (pushing through "curtain," roots prying flagstones); the film negative constrains climax and charges final image ("echoes followed, softer now"). Environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy's burden) tightens via protagonist agency when negative reconfigures burden as "map to follow," narrowing options with felt cost. Pressure grows through sensory density shifts toward crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (burned diaries, inverted negative) without moralizing; final image reweights legacy as "hope shared across time" without stating a moral. Avoids false balance on culpability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("damp air clinging like regret," sounds as "symphony of silences"); syntax modulates under pressure ("heart quickening," "fingers trembling"). No head-hopping; voice remains character-particular throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "fluttering like trapped moths" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise high density with rhythmic propulsion. No loops or figurative muddle in peak beats, but one borderline cliché prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Corridor echo cartographer" transforms climate fiction tropes via specific mechanics (echo probes, light-based mapping); legacy burden avoids abstraction through Harlan's diaries and negative's tangible cost.</comment>
