<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "capturing impermanent" art versus seeking fixed truth, but apprentice's captivity lacks embodied reaction cost; micro-choices like frost-tracing reveal hierarchy of values without over-rationalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: grotto discovery crystallizes options with conceptual cost (apprentice captive), but the felt cost of her endurance isn't fully embodied on-page during the final reflection moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice (tracing smuggler's route) and charges the final grotto image, though canyon's spatial choreography lacks tactical constraints beyond atmospheric resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (retracing via frost patterns), but the escalation lacks visible price paid mid-journey; the apprentice's captivity revelation deepens knowledge without altering Elara's immediate tactics or stamina.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from glass/frost motifs reweighted at closure ("purpose in pauses"), but final "destined to uncover" line edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in glass-artist POV (light/frost attention), yet tense shifts during reflection ("She had survived") create subtle focalization drift that momentarily distances the reader from present urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density in frost descriptions suffers minor scaffold ("intricate patterns... natural tapestry"), and "drifting resonance" repetition creates synonym churn in the final paragraph, dulling closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of glass artistry with smuggling intrigue feels fresh, but "luminous glass" trope risks genericity; specificity in charcoal ledger's physicality and frost mechanics elevates beyond template.</comment>
