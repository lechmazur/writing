<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks concrete contradictory impulses; "cautious exuberance" embodiment strong early but pivotal documentation choice feels externally guided by watch mechanics rather than earned internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with pulsing parchment implying ongoing cost, but watch's agency ("chosen her") slightly undermines protagonist causality; cost legible yet conceptual repricing not fully earned by her actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library functions as active micro-setting: shifting symbols constrain movement, watch's warmth/hum anchor choices, and glowing books directly charge the final image per 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation builds through sensory density (hum syncing with shelves), but dominant stake ("find her answer") remains abstract; cost felt in leaving sanctuary yet insufficient protagonist-driven narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken words as living entities emerges through concrete particulars (propagation delays, symbols on parchment), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "conduit" role without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symbols danced cyclically reversed," "scent of old parchment and metallic tang") modulates perfectly under pressure; zero head-hopping, lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion and density, but verbatim repetition of "cautious exuberance" (opening/closing) creates paraphrase loop in peak beats, preventing 9.0 despite exceptional textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through specific mechanics (propagation delays, cyclically reversed time); "unspoken words as living" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
