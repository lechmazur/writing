<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority strong ("frayed surface, strange warmth") but lacks contradictory impulses; "credibly curious" trait drives action without visible trade-offs or cost. Final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (rain "in harmony" reconfiguring chaos/calm balance) under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; no exact sentence shows forfeiture or price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bell rope functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (tug triggers revelation) and charges final image ("testament to listening"). Sanctuary details evolve causally with wind shifts, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("whispers vs. noise") signaled early but pressure lacks tightening; anomaly discovery feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No meaningful trade-off when pulling rope—gains wisdom without visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: final "solstice hush spoke volumes" reweights silence as wisdom without moralizing. Rain’s "harmony" crystallizes balance between chaos/calm as resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air carried secrets," "wind’s chaos") with rhythmic control; stress compresses diction appropriately ("hum reached crescendo"). No POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor density issues in high-pressure beat ("strange warmth, as if alive" slightly overwrought) but zero loops/scaffold. Final line’s "spoke volumes" achieves textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of storm-watcher trope through bell-rope-as-switch metaphor; avoids abstraction via concrete sensory details. "Zero hour" concept underdeveloped prevents higher score despite strong voice integration.</comment>
