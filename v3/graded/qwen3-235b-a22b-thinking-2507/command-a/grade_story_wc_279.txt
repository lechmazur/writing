<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's whimsy and social perceptiveness drive micro-choices (interjecting flake, whispering question) with embodied contradiction—lilac unease deepening yet purpose emerging. Epiphany slightly unearned; "meaning was not found but created" lacks sufficient struggle before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: Elara's stance crystallizes ("meaning created one whisper at a time") with felt cost (lilac unease becoming guide). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but cost legibility falters—unease's transformation lacks visceral specificity in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto mist and tile flake constrain choices (flake insertion shifts mandala) and charge final image ("heart alight with emergent hush"). Sensory details (cool flake, thickened mist) are purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as mandala reveals silenced voices, narrowing Elara's path from discovery to honoring silence. Agency-driven escalation works, but cost ("lilac unease") remains abstract; deeper physical or relational consequence needed for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mandala's evolution and flake's dissolution, resisting tidy morals. Penalized for thematic echo: "meaning was not found but created" states thesis explicitly in final paragraph, undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mist clung like reluctant lover," socially perceptive tracing) with rhythmic control. Voice modulates under pressure (whimsy bristling at tragedy); no head-hopping. Patterned elision (unlearning backstory) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but overwriting in high-pressure beats: "lilac unease" borders on decorative labeling, and "connection across time and space" dilutes immediacy. Template cadence ("She interjected...") in mid-beat slightly dulls closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mystical artistry and collective silence, with grotto's specificity anchoring universals. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but "whispering gallery" trope leans familiar; emotional truth elevates beyond template.</comment>
