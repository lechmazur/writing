<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("muted vigor," "canvas upon which world painted secrets") without contradictory impulses; seasonal muteness isn't leveraged for on-page tradeoffs despite clear motivation. Final choice lacks visible micro-choice escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("this moment... was fleeting") under Accumulative/Textural lens, but iceberg's "truth" remains conceptual rather than concretely earned through causality. Cost proof weakened by serene resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff's micro-setting (cloud-obscured horizon, thin air) charges final image of descent; iceberg fragment's light evolution directly constrains the kinetic sculpture's creation and final wrapping. Sensory details reflect urgency without checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) tightens through iceberg's intensifying glisten, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Elara's actions follow predetermined ritual without adaptation to rising stakes. Cost ("fleeting" wonder) is legible but passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "color of wonder" motif reweighted by final image (walking into silence), avoiding moralizing. However, "beauty in impermanence" insight borders on abstract statement rather than earned through specific struggle, weakening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds draped like soft gray blanket," "cerulean expanse whispering truths") modulates with scene intensity. No head-hopping, but "frozen tears of the gods" momentarily drifts into generic lyricism during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in climax ("light fracturing into a thousand shimmering fragments... clouds seemed to part") dulls closure image; "muted vigor" repetition creates scaffold. Strong propulsion otherwise, but artifacts in final third disallow 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bell tuning and kinetic ice sculpture feels inevitable, but "seasonally mute" trait lacks transformation beyond setup. Emotional specificity in wonder's fragility elevates, though premise risks derivative archetypal resonance.</comment>
