<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in hesitation before the figure, but "logically emotional nature warring within her" uses diagnostic label-speak during climax (-0.4). Embodied emotion strong elsewhere (trembling hands, key's cool metal), yet flaw undermines pivotal realization moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (fading sunset, battle "not over"), but causality breaks at climax: Elara realizes deception only after the key repels the figure, not during the vision sequence. One distinct non-closure issue (-0.8) despite strong orientation and lens adherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting pressures time (sunset fading) and reveals threat (ice cracking), yet fails 9+ gate: no tool/environment constrains final choice. Micro-setting (key's warmth) charges closure image weakly; drift-ice marina remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when visions force Elara's choice, and agency drives escalation ("Prove it," channeling energy). Visible cost (trembling hands, lost daylight) charges the final image, but lacks physical toll from channeling power to reach 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic mechanics ("vibrational matching"), not moralizing. Final line reweights "logic and heart" as active stance crystallizing the central question. Avoids Thematic Echo by showing balance through action, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (engineer noticing mechanisms), but stress response lacks authenticity: diction stays uniformly poetic during confrontation. "Logically emotional nature warring" slips into therapy-speak, disrupting voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Final paragraph contains paraphrase loop ("battle wasn't over... purpose clear... role she would fulfill") and filter verb ("power still resonant within her"). Text-artifact penalty (-0.7) applies as artifacts dull closure image despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic physics with guardian mythos elevates trope. Drift-ice specificity avoids Arctic clichés, yet "crypt keeper's key" remains generic fantasy scaffolding. Risk-taking in vibrational mechanics heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
