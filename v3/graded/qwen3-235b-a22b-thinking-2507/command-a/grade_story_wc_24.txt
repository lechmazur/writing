<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels unearned without visible struggle. "Essence of time" abstraction triggers diagnostic label penalty (-0.5) during peak realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing but cost remains abstract ("profound peace" lacks tangible consequence). Missing visible price on final image deducts 0.6 per Q2 cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid ("fjord quiet", "sea of mist") but horizon station fails to constrain choices. Micro-setting key charges closure, yet environment itself doesn't shape tactics per 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through density accumulation, but agency passive—revelation happens *to* Elias. No trade-offs or narrowing options; conceptual cost insufficient for high-band entry per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme undermined by scroll's direct statement ("Time is not measured in seconds..."), triggering Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6). Final image reweights key but moralizing overshadows earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused hands", "rhythmic hum") with rhythmic control. Minor tense shift ("had just blown" → "began to count") and scroll's academic register slightly disrupt voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean propulsion with purposeful compression, but "razor edges" metaphor muddles logic (edges don't cut). "Landscape of endless possibility" overwriting dulls final image impact (-0.4).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Hydraulic clock shepherd" offers fresh occupational angle, yet clock-key-revelation trope remains derivative. Fails transformation test—swap "shepherd" for "astronomer" without altering emotional arc (-0.5).</comment>
