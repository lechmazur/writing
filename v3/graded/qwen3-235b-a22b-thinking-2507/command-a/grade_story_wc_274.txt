<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bravely conflicted") shown through physical tremors and racing heart, but verbatim label repetition ("bravely conflicted") triggers diagnostic-speak penalty; micro-choices like seal-breaking earn final renunciation, though moral ambiguity lacks depth beyond duty/truth binary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("betrayal of everything") and visible dread, but final thematic echo ("world would never be the same") undermines legibility; causal lens holds firmly through letter→network→transfer sequence with meaningful tightening at terminal access.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snow-muffled library constrains choice (slowed footsteps, icy walls) and charges final image (stepping into snow); "frosted glass" and terminal hum integrate action with sensory specificity, though "dizzying quiet" overuse slightly dilutes texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (duty vs. truth) escalates causally through seal-breaking to data theft, narrowing options to "copy or be caught"; cost legible in "surge of triumph and dread" with snow-library bearing witness, fulfilling band guardrails for 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</comment>Theme emerges through "contraband truths" motif reweighted by final possession, but final paragraph moralizing ("fragility of truth") triggers thematic echo penalty; ambiguity in "cost of bravery" lingers yet lacks conceptual repricing depth for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath visible," "fingers brushed icy walls") sustains cryogenic archivist POV; rhythmic control tightens during terminal scene, though "bravely conflicted" repetition causes minor voice convergence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Zero loops but "dizzying quiet" repetition (4x) and final abstract moralizing create scaffold; high density in network sequence with concrete verbs ("copied," "flickering"), yet "world would never be the same" dulls closure image per text-artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archives + truth suppression avoids sci-fi tropes through tactile library details; "dormant networks" as micro-setting transforms familiar leak premise, though risk-taking stops short of full conceptual integrity without deeper moral calculus.</comment>
