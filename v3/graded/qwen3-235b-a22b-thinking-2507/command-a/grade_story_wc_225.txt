<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (fidgeting vs. fierce repose), but the chess tutor expertise lacks causal weight in decisions; guilt remains abstract without embodied tradeoffs during thread-decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("weight of guilt began to lift"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant at end) slightly weakens escalation; thunder motif resolves without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains choice (entry requires thread-decoding), but time-frozen village remains atmospheric backdrop; chess piece charges final image yet lacks mid-scene tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through tapestry decoding, but cost remains internal/emotional; no tangible loss alters tactics beyond the psychological shift at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from tapestry’s "king/pawn" parallel and final thread message; avoids moralizing yet the woven hush concept feels decorative rather than pressure-driving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers fidgeted productively," "woven hush") modulates under stress, but "fierce repose" is stated not demonstrated through evolving syntax during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control ("hours passed, or perhaps only minutes") yet template cadence in setting descriptions ("cobblestone streets," "ancient stone walls") slightly dulls momentum in early beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy and textile metaphors feels inevitable, but "time-frozen village" leans derivative; emotional specificity in guilt-resolution elevates beyond trope.</comment>
