<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "luminous skeptic" trait drives concrete choices (doubt→curiosity shift), but the reflection moment lacks embodied cost. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs wonder) shown through micro-choices like pocketing the first shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: placing the shard releases memories/water with visible cost (confronting trapped younger self). Causal lens holds perfectly—breadcrumbs narrow options relentlessly. No orientation debt; anchors established by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fountains constrain choices (breadcrumb locations in dried basins) and charge the final image (water's return). Slight over-reliance on visual metaphors ("cobblestones whisper") but setting directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency—each breadcrumb deepens knowledge and narrows options under causal lens. Cost is legible in the reflection moment, though "testing her" abstraction slightly weakens pressure in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (stained glass = fragmented memory), no moralizing. Final water imagery reweights "unsticking the past" without stating morals, though the fountain inscription edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes carried their own moon," "sidereal patience") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from skeptical ("laughed at the cryptic message") to wonder without slippage. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in opening ("dismantle illusions yet weave possibilities / weave possibilities from threads"). High density otherwise; final image ("water began to flow, its song echoing") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms scavenger-hunt trope through specific voice and setting logic. Emotional truth in "liberator" arc avoids sentimentality, though migrating geese timeframe lacks fresh inflection. Risk-taking elevates stakes coherently.</comment>
