<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but interior contradiction lacks depth; her flaw-free execution under pressure undermines earned stakes. Thaddeus serves plot function without testing her values, missing micro-choices that would charge the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost via stabilized chronometer, but escalation lacks narrowing options—Thaddeus resolves the conflict. Two distinct issues (passive protagonist, vague cost) trigger -1.5 Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Silo atmosphere is vivid but fails 9+ gate: setting doesn’t constrain choices (device fix relies on urn fragment, not silo mechanics). Recurring urn fragment charges final image yet lacks causal pressure in key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing time) is signaled early, but escalation isn’t driven by Elara’s agency—Thaddeus provides solutions. Cost remains abstract ("profound sense of purpose") without tangible forfeiture, failing band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme ("texture of time passing") emerges organically through urn fragment and final tactile imagery. Avoids moralizing, but "rediscovered her own connection" edges toward sentimentality, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice shows distinct perceptual signature (time-focused details like "flickered erratically"), with clean POV control. Dialogue carries subtext, though stress moments lack diction modulation—no rhythmic shift during device activation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong rhythm, but "suddenly timeless" is label-only description. Minor scaffold ("Intrigued, Elara decided...") dilutes momentum; final line’s "texture of time passing" borders on thematic echo without deepening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms timekeeper trope via "temporal weaving" concept and garage sale investigation. Emotional specificity in Thaddeus’ grief elevates clichés, though "emerald silo" leans generic. Risk-taking (lyric time mechanics) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
