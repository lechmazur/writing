<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Abstract motivation ("sculpt patience") lacks embodied struggle; "unyoke chaos" reads as diagnostic label-speak without concrete micro-choices showing contradictory impulses. Final endurance lacks visible cost scaling to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: no clear "where" (sanctuary geography) by 120 words; closure (Earned Stasis atop viaduct) lacks legible cost—completion feels unearned without dramatized price. Lens (Accumulative) holds but pressure never tightens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Basalt/frozen lake setting described vividly but ornamental; no constraint on choices (e.g., ice thickness affecting movement). Viaduct's "hum" charges final image but micro-setting doesn't alter tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("patient revolution") remains abstractly declared; no on-page escalation or narrowing of options. Urgencies vanish without showing cost—Elara simply "replaces" them, violating Band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Thematic Echo: final paragraph states "sculpted patience... unyoked potential" in prompt-like language (-0.7). Motif recurrence (moon/viaduct) feels symbolic rather than constraining choices, undermining organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("air crackled with restrained wildness") and rhythmic control; "magnetic viaduct after rain" phrasing jars as unnatural POV lexicon but overall voice remains cohesive under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "softly purposeful" repeated with slight variation. Overwritten lyricism ("silver light... illuminating the path") risks muddling momentum but avoids closure-dulling artifacts in final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Derivative premise (nature mysticism + patience trope) lacks transformation; "patient revolution" feels templated. Specific basalt/frozen lake details offer freshness but proximity to common spiritual tropes caps originality.</comment>
