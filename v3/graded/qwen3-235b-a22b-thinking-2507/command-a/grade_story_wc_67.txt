<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in embracing fragility while seeking closure is embodied through ash scattering, but "mirage of safety" reflection lacks micro-choice integration with the rocking chair's stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("safety is mirage"), but rocking chair's timed stillness feels coincidental rather than causally earned under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Porcelain mask constrains choices by symbolizing fragility during ash scattering, charging the final image where ash settles "like a silent benediction" on the fractured art.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through ash scattering's physical act, but the rocking chair's cessation lacks causal pressure—it merely witnesses rather than tightening options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through mask/ash interplay showing beauty in fragility, but "mirage of safety" is stated rather than reweighted through action; final image avoids moralizing yet lacks conceptual repricing punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" lexicon, but filter-verb stacks ("Elara felt," "she knew") dull immediacy during peak scattering sequence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwritten density in "haunting testament to fragility, its jagged edges catching the light..." muddles physical logic; paraphrase loops ("grief and beauty of impermanence"/"fleeting emotion") weaken propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash scattering as narrative device elevates trope, but "mirage of safety" concept lacks non-obvious moral calculus; specificity in gallery details avoids generic abstraction.</comment>
