<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "unfiltered awakening" borders on diagnostic label-speak; contradictory impulses (survivor/seeker) earned through crystal study, though motivation ("find unused potential") remains abstract without concrete prior causality anchoring the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (final image reconfigures "survivor" to "seeker" with felt cost: "world still broken"), but lens (Accumulative/Textural) ambiguously established until midway; circuit breakers' silence creates necessary pressure for crystallization without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Geodes function as micro-setting charging the final image ("talisman"), yet observatory fails to constrain choices beyond providing silence; "circuit breakers cooling" alters tactics but underutilized—environment shapes reflection without active pressure on pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Zara's agency: internal conflict (grief vs purpose) tightens when she shifts from seeking answers to embracing the process; conceptual cost ("world still broken") legible, but escalation lacks visceral narrowing of options beyond cognitive reframing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically via geode symbolism (resilience under pressure), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "bleak exhilaration" without stating a moral. However, "unfiltered awakening" phrasing risks thematic echo, slightly undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of ash clung like second skin") and rhythmic control excel under stress; syntactic compression during crystal touch ("jolt of clarity") heightens pressure. No POV leakage, though "intangibly tangible" momentarily drifts from character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractures and inclusions, each one a story of pressure") propels momentum. "Unfiltered awakening" repetition approaches paraphrase loop but redeemed by contextual deepening; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics metaphors (perturbation theory) with trauma recovery avoids tropes, but geode symbolism leans familiar; risk-taking elevates stakes via "bleak exhilaration" tension, though drone strike premise lacks transformative specificity to reach 9+.</comment>
