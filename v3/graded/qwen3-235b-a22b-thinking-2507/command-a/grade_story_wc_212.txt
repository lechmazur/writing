<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("furiously tranquil," "heart pounding yet strangely at peace") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices under pressure are minimal (acorn cap insertion lacks struggle). Motivation is clear but grandmother's backstory exceeds BRR limits without tilting present stance via on-page micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation succeeds (atrium anchored by para 1), but closure's Charged Poise lacks unmistakable cost proof—"smooth yet fragile" texture is conceptual without concrete forfeiture. Escalation is flat; vortex reopening occurs smoothly after one action with no narrowing of options or felt price at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Starlight-filtered crystalline spires create vivid atmosphere, but setting fails 9+ gate: the atrium doesn't constrain choices (e.g., no environmental pressure on acorn cap insertion). Micro-setting (oak cap) lacks causal role—static description without altering tactics despite appearing in two beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes (restore balance via vortex) are clear early, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening—reopening relies on coincidence ("low hum vibrating"), not protagonist choices. "Decreasing entropy" method remains abstract exposition; no visible price paid that alters tactics or charges the final image under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from seed-saving metaphor and "borrowed time" texture; avoids moralizing with resonant final image ("nurturing the future... one moment at a time"). But "texture of borrowed time" feels prompt-derived, slightly undermining earned wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice ("shimmering, winged being embodying chaos and calm") with strong perceptual signature early on. Degrades under stress with filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she understood") and unmotivated label-speak ("furiously tranquil") that breaks POV modesty during peak pressure at the vortex.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats ("pulsed with energy, its colors shifting like a living entity") and template cadence in action sequence ("She pressed... the ice began... the archway groaned") dull immediacy. No closure artifacts, but paraphrase loops ("reversing decay that had consumed her world"/"restoring balance") trigger text-artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical preservation with entropy concepts avoids trope safety; seed saver role feels necessary to the vortex logic. But "texture of borrowed time" is a clichéd framing device that slightly undermines risk-taking. Transformation test passes—would collapse with generic protagonist.</comment>
