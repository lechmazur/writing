<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("ruin to reverence") remains abstract; no contradictory impulses or embodied struggle during "doubt and fatigue" moments. Interiority relies on poetic labels ("hauntingly optimistic") without character-specific contradiction or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis as canyon exhales with stories) lands with felt cost (her exhaustion), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—the sleepwalking paths accumulate passively without narrowing options or raising stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and orchid solace create vivid atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices (e.g., stone resists sewing) or charges closure beyond decorative backdrop; micro-setting potential squandered despite strong sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("ruin to reverence") is declared but never concretely tested; pressure remains diffuse ("whispers of voices") without a single on-page reversal or trade-off that forecloses options. "Doubt and fatigue" lack tangible manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme ("broken precedents to art") emerges through imagery but final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("testament to perseverance") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, undermining earned resonance despite strong orchid solace motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice falters under pressure—repetitive abstractions ("hauntingly optimistic") replace character-specific perception; "poetic wharf weaver" trait isn't embodied in sensory choices during high-stakes sewing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting plagues peak beats: "air was thick with the scent of earth and time, a hauntingly optimistic aura" mixes incompatible metaphors. Final third's "perpetual cycle of creation" is stock phrasing, triggering -1.7 artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" offers fresh emotional texture, but "wharf weaver" and "sleepwalking" feel like aesthetic tropes rather than transformed through specific stakes; premise lacks bold risk-taking beyond surface lyricism.</comment>
