<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (fear/challenge of telepathy, tradition/evolution) manifest in micro-choices like lying to the guard while trembling. But "accidental telepathy" lacks visible cost—plant whispers ease conflict rather than complicate choices, muting stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise (embryo’s light as beacon for rebirth), but cost feels abstract. Vision fading leaves "breathless" as sole physical toll; guard’s convenient exit avoids meaningful escalation or sacrifice under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Volcanic setting charges final image (kite tail fluttering in steam), and embryo constrains choice via alignment mechanics. Yet hot springs’ heat/water duality doesn’t pressure tactics—remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (cultural restoration vs. regime) tighten when guard appears, but resolution lacks cost: plant manipulation dissolves threat effortlessly. Escalation driven by Mara’s agency, yet cost ("breathlessness") feels conceptual, not visceral or tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (evolution as rebirth) resonates through embryo/kite motifs without moralizing. Final line ("Reconstruction was not just about rebuilding—it was about reimagining") subtly reweights the premise, avoiding overt statement while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV consistency shines: Mara’s age colors perception ("wrinkled finger," "back rigid"), and stress compresses syntax during guard confrontation. No register drift; plant whispers feel embodied, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "steam rose like ghosts" and "roar" create purposeful cadence shifts. Final line’s "beacon" crystallizes closure without muddle. Minor slip: "mind humming" edges toward generic abstraction mid-tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "insurgent elder" trope via plant telepathy specificity and quiet Charged Poise closure. But volcanic setting leans generic; "amber embryo" risks symbolic convenience without deeper world logic integration.</comment>
