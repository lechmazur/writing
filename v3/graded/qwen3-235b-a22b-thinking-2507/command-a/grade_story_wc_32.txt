<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("resolve hardening like frost") with embodied emotion, but epiphany lacks sufficient in-scene struggle to fully earn the turnaround; "stoically sensitive" remains somewhat label-dependent without deeper contradictory impulses during pivotal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (broken crozier nourishing sapling), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; minor deduction as the "penny drop" moment feels slightly unearned by immediate prior causality despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ember nexus creates vivid atmosphere but functions decoratively; micro-setting (crozier, frozen bloom) charges the final image, yet environment doesn't constrain choices or tactics, missing the 9+ gate requirement for active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through deepening realization under Accumulative lens; dominant stake (escaping failure destiny) tightens meaningfully as the crozier's redefinition narrows options, with visible cost (abandoning resurrection for transformation) legible in the sapling's emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (crozier as seed, sapling from ashes) without moralizing; final image reweights "creative destruction" as non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity through "beauty in what others discarded."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of ash and forgotten dreams") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "method of successive approximation" slightly disrupts voice-motivated lexicon during high-stakes realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but scaffolding weakens climax ("Elara was stoically sensitive..."); near-duplicate phrasing ("fragile yet insistent"/"crystallized yet unyielding") in pivotal beats reduces density without pattern payoff, slightly dulling closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy tropes through specific, grounded details (crozier as catalyst, ember nexus); emotional truth in "transformation not resurrection" twist feels inevitable, though setting lacks sufficient specificity to fully resist generic "ruins" associations.</comment>
