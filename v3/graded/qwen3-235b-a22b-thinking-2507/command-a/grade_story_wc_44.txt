<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows deliberate nature through precise rune-etching micro-choices, but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "many more mysteries" endurance earns closure yet internal conflict remains surface-level despite high-stakes context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("key felt heavy... purpose fulfilled") under clear causal lens; orientation anchored in first sentence, escalation tightens options through workshop-to-precipice progression with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Floating isle's edge setting constrains climax choice (void location), and clockwork key charges final image; sensory details ("thinner air," "swirling void") reflect urgency though occupational specificity remains thin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early via shadow mystery; one tightening (noon void activation) forecloses the core question with conceptual cost, but felt price lacks visceral weight beyond key's dormancy despite agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Final image ("work far from over") reweights shadow mystery as part of larger quest without moralizing; theme emerges through void revelation but lacks counter-readings, slightly reducing complexity in the resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("runes pulsed faintly," "resonance with key") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control sustains causal momentum with no head-hopping, though minor register drift occurs in reflection fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; high density ("shadows coalescing into swirling void") with purposeful rhythm variation, though "more familiar, more alive" shows slight synonym churn near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "spoons bend reality" with shadow physics feels inevitable; risk-taking in mosaic-like shard progression (workshop/edge) heightens stakes, but trope transformation lacks emotional specificity at climax.</comment>
