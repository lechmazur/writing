<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is told not shown. "Longing for something just out of reach" summarizes rather than embodies conflict through micro-choices under pressure. Final endurance lacks visible trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "spirit alight" crystallizing options, but cost remains abstract ("fear and exhilaration"). Missing concrete on-page price for the 9+ band. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway shifts symbols yet fails to constrain choices—the glowing arch doesn’t alter Lira’s actions. Misses 9+ gate requirement that setting must charge final image or constrain choice, capping at 8.8 despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing creativity) remain static; "shadowed rapture" intensifies but without narrowing options or visible price. Band guardrail violated: no tangible cost charging the final image under Accumulative lens, though aurora’s song swelling provides sufficient deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stardust motif but "Lira believed" states rather than dramatizes the core concept. Final image reweights the quest ("only the beginning") yet lacks the non-literal answer required for 9+; avoids moralizing but misses Q5 quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rustle of leaves spoke of ancient journeys") shines, but filter-verb stacks ("Lira felt," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak aurora scene. Rhythmic control strong, yet head-hopping risk in cosmic "whispers" slightly disrupts focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No prose artifacts or loops; lyrical density serves momentum. "Shards of glass that glimmered like captured starlight" exemplifies purposeful specificity. Final line’s "shadowed rapture of the stars" avoids cliché with resonant closure charge, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "dreamer" trope through cosmic synesthesia, but premise ("free trapped creativity") lacks fresh inflection—it’s a familiar mystical quest without non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional truth anchors originality, yet Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.7) for insufficient lived detail.</comment>
