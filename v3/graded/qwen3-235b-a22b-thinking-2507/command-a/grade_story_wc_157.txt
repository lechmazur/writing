<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias shows embodied contradiction (charm vs tension) and micro-choices (dagger reach), but his "spark of defiance" motivation lacks deeper internal struggle beyond surface-level fear; Dr. Krane’s instant trust undermines status dynamics crucial for the scene’s pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear Situational lens holds through greenhouse confrontation to Charged Poise closure ("world felt heavier... Elias felt alive"), but orientation anchors arrive late (142 words), missing the 120-word threshold and capping Q3 at 7.0 per policy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse sensory details ("damp earth and jasmine," "hum of trapped insects") vividly anchor mood, but the setting never constrains choices or charges the final image—Krane moves freely, Elias accesses the seed unimpeded, failing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (Lexicon survival) tighten when Krane reveals infiltration, but escalation lacks tangible cost: Elias never weighs sacrifice against action, and the "heavier world" feels abstract rather than altering tactics under Situational pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "spark of defiance" motif evolves from abstract to embodied in the final image ("greenhouse stood silent... waiting for rebellion"), but thematic resonance leans slightly on generic resistance tropes without unique moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct atmospheric voice ("edges blurred by fear," "whispers in alleys") modulates effectively with tension, though Elias’ internal lexicon occasionally slips into authorial exposition ("his spark of defiance burning brighter") during peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "air" repetition ("air hummed," "air thickened") and filter verbs ("he noticed," "he knew") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh "Thought Tax" premise transforms surveillance dystopia through linguistic rebellion, but greenhouse/entomologist tropes feel derivative; the gourd seed cipher elevates specificity yet lacks sufficient risk-taking to hit 9+ band.</comment>
