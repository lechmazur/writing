<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "awkward confidence" told not shown through micro-choices. Epiphany lacks earned causality despite strong embodied emotion in stone circle scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with felt cost ("lull felt less like rest and more like defeat"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) slightly weakens escalation. Hum intensification reweights stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spaceport setting creates vivid atmosphere but fails micro-setting test; opera glasses charge final image ("slipped into her pocket"), constraining Lira's action and reweighting meaning through tactile recurrence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via cosmic vision, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the hum acts upon Lira rather than her choices under pressure. Cost ("defeat" feeling) established early but not viscerally paid in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through stars' whisper: "not in grand victories... but in small acts of courage." Final image of bare feet carrying her toward scattered rebels reweights "thunderous serenity" as actionable hope without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (stargazer's POV) with rhythmic control, but uniform poetic cadence during vision ("vibrant, living constellations") dulls pressure modulation. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "Lira’s motivation was clear: to discover meaning..." weakens propulsion. Template cadence in stone circle sequence ("kneeled... pressed... felt") costs density, but final line's "margin of daylight" resonance saves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic wonder with rebellion aftermath; "thunderous serenity" redefines hope as vibration. Transformation test passed—swap "rebellion" for "war" breaks thematic specificity of "scattered remnants."</comment>
