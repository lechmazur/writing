<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete contradiction; "tremor of certainty" repeats as label not embodied struggle. Diagnostic phrasing like "courage to dismantle walls" triggers -0.5 penalty in peak beats. No visible tradeoffs despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (lake reshaped), but "ban lifts" setup remains unexplained, weakening causal linkage. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet underdeveloped stakes limit escalation impact at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid cobalt light and quartz hum create atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices—poet enters/leaves freely. Micro-setting (frost-kissed ground) charges final image weakly; environment fails to alter tactics despite lyrical richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcending boundaries) lacks concrete opposition; "ban" mentioned but unused. Escalation is atmospheric (ice cracking), not driven by agency. Cost felt but not viscerally dramatized—surrender remains abstract despite transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ice/atrium imagery, but explicit statement—"sacred was not in walls but spaces"—triggers -0.6 penalty. Final image (atrium bowing) resonates as CR, yet moralizing taints earned complexity in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aesthetically driven," moth-hush rhythm) sustains voice. Under stress, diction stays elevated (unrealistic for crisis), but rhythmic control in climax ("shards floated upward...") avoids monotony. No head-hopping; focalization consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("cobalt atrium," "humming quartz") enhances texture without muddling closure. Minor overwriting in climax ("suspended in air as if held by invisible hands") risks momentum but payoff justifies it. Flawless cadence modulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "paraphrase as transformation" elevates trope, but "artist transcends boundaries" remains familiar. Specificity (lantern-moth hush, quartz secrets) avoids genericity, yet risk-taking doesn't fully reconfigure emotional stakes beyond expected arc.</comment>
