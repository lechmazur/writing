<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s control/surrender conflict, but "reluctant metamorphosis" label intrudes as diagnostic speak during climax, undermining embodied emotion. Micro-choices (rearranging pots) reveal values with visible cost, yet the leaf’s role as catalyst lacks causal depth in her shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the nursery still stood, but it was no longer the same place" crystallizes cost of surrendered control. Storm pressure accumulates texturally to this moment, though the leaf’s dissolution edges toward coincidence rather than earned causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The linden leaf and mossy trellis constrain choice—Mara’s surrender is charged by the leaf’s warmth and the trellis becoming a "gateway." Rain’s physicality (drenched clothes, clinging fabric) embodies transformation, elevating micro-setting beyond atmosphere to active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm pressure tightens through sensory escalation (rain intensifying, trembling hands), narrowing Mara’s options to surrender. Cost is unmistakable in "lighter than she had in years" amid drenched clothes—a felt trade-off. Agency slightly falters as the leaf’s dissolution resolves the conflict it didn’t fully create.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the leaf’s evolving role, but "reluctant metamorphosis" as stated phrase triggers thematic echo penalty. Final image (sunlight after storm) reweights control vs. surrender without moralizing, though the concept’s direct naming dilutes subtextual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara’s botanist focus shapes sensory details ("veined leaf," "damp moss grounding her"). Voice modulates under stress—sentences fragment during surrender ("She laughed softly...")—with no head-hopping. Single-POV restraint amplifies intimacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise ("edges shimmering with rainwater"), but "thoughts winding like vines" creates a mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold in "her resolve begin to crack... felt lighter" slightly dulls propulsion, though final lines achieve crystalline density without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms the "nature catalyst" trope through Mara’s specific resistance to change. Emotional truth in her fear of losing control feels fresh, yet storm/leaf symbolism risks familiarity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
