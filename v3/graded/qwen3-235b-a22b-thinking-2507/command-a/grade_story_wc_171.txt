<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "voice broke" moment shows vulnerability but no simultaneous doubt. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("ideals chipped away") rather than embodied degradation under stress. Micro-choices like clutching clipboard anchor traits but final renunciation lacks visceral cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with treaty signing and dawn arrival, but "price of redemption" speech borders on thematic echo (-0.2). Orientation clear early; Accumulative lens holds through celestial/terrace motifs. Cost legible in "cost she was still learning to bear" though emotional specificity could deepen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terrace and clipboard function as micro-setting that constrains choices: descent ritualizes pressure, clipboard stains mirror flawed process. Final image of "held loosely" recharges terrace's sacred weight with earned fragility. Sensory details (jasmine, ink stains) filter through negotiator's urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Escalation via Elara's internal collapse ("voice broke") drives the turning point under Accumulative lens, but leaders' sudden shift lacks causal buildup. Dominant stake (redemption cost) tightens meaningfully, yet ritual significance pressure feels underutilized until climax. Cost visible in her "cost she was still learning to bear" but could be more embodied earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "flawed beauty" motif reweighted from clipboard to peace itself, avoiding direct moralizing. Final image of fragile dawn offers resonant answer to "price of redemption." Loses points for "peace was fragile, imperfect, precious" stating theme rather than charging it through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: negotiator notices tactical details (leaders' "suspicion and fatigue," ink stains). Rhythmic control tightens during negotiation ("hours turned into days"). Slight register drift in "operatively gentle" repetition, but lyric compression taught early via celestial/terrace patterns pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "ideals chipped away" and "anchor her ideals" tell rather than show internal conflict. "Flawed beauty" repetition in final paragraph creates paraphrase loop (-0.3). Final line’s "chance for light" risks sentimentality, though celestial motif integration saves it from thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms peace negotiator trope through specific artifacts: clipboard’s physicality embodies flawed process, terrace as active pressure point. "Price of redemption" reframed as internal willingness avoids cliché. Fresh inflection in Earned Stasis closure where peace persists despite personal cost—no safety-hedging.</comment>
