<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives action but lacks layered conflict during climax; embodied emotion strong ("boots crunching," "hum vibrated through bones") yet final choice lacks visible tradeoffs beyond pen's loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "world still uncertain, but she was confidently uncertain" crystallizes stance with felt cost in pen's demotion to "dried-up relic," though escalation lacks pressure spikes before void entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly's "rippled like water" and pen's "glowing nib" constrain choices (stepping in, writing without ink), charging final image; micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere into active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing anomaly) tightens through time-fragment collision, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—void shifts passively to her presence without compounding cost before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of contingent history emerges through pen's use on "interconnected web," but "she had threshed meaning from experience" borders on thematic echo, diluting earned resonance in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time folded like crumpled paper") sustains under pressure, though minor register drift in "contingent relationships" momentarily disrupts voice coherence during void entry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in para 3 ("confidently uncertain—that’s how she’d always described herself. It was a paradox...") dulls immediacy; otherwise strong propulsion and specificity, but artifact caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Contingent relationships" reworks time-travel tropes with fresh emotional logic; specificity of "farmer’s seeds/historian’s words" avoids abstraction, though premise risks derivative feel without pen’s tactile reprise.</comment>
