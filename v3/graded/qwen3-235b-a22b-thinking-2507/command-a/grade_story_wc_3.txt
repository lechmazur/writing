<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (caution vs yearning) is concrete but the resolution lacks visible struggle; peace arrives via vision without earned micro-choices under pressure. Mentor’s spirit functions as backstory anchor but doesn’t actively constrain choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost (ambitions transformed), but escalation lacks tightening—seed activation happens abruptly without narrowing options. Orientation is solid (arbor established by para 1), yet pressure doesn’t cohere under Accumulative lens until climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting vividly establishes atmosphere ("air shimmered with unseen energies") but remains passive; magnetic arbor never constrains choices or supplies resources. The seed-as-micro-setting charges the ending image but doesn’t actively pressure middle beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding transition) is clear early, but internal conflict isn’t tested meaningfully—planting the seed requires no trade-off. Cost is felt ("void now purpose") but not dramatized; no visible price paid beyond emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the seed/tree metaphor ("truth to be lived"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights transition physics with earned resonance, but "haunted ambitions" resolves too neatly without lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("methodical hands," "shimmered with unseen energies") modulates with stress; syntax tightens during seed activation. No POV drift, though reflection paragraphs slightly dilute immediacy under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("her hands moved... her mind piecing" followed by "methodical nature urged") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") dull momentum. Final line lacks propulsion, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cuneiform scholarship with speculative physics; "knowledge fruit" trope transformed through translator’s precision. Emotional specificity in ambition-to-peace arc avoids templates, though mentor’s spirit feels derivative.</comment>
