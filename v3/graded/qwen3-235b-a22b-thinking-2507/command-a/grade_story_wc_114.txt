<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through botanical focus vs truth-haunting, but "fault-tolerant oracle" trait remains abstract label without altering tactics; micro-choices like smudging ink reveal values, yet swallowed truth motivation lacks embodied friction until closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: auroral sorrow transforming into resilient sway reconfigures truth’s weight, but fever backstory exceeds BRR limits by summarizing without present-micro-choice anchor, slightly muddying causality at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mountain station’s metal frame and ozone scent evolve with wind’s intrusion, constraining Elara’s choices; botanical illustration’s smudge charges final image, though pine/damp earth details feel ornamental rather than pressure-driving in key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth’s weight) tightens through illustration’s distortion and wanderer’s dialogue, but escalation leans on thematic exposition ("truths are like roots") rather than protagonist agency; cost legible via sorrow-to-resilience shift yet feels narratively assisted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from smudged illustration’s evolution, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights truth as nurtured seed, but wanderer’s "shadow" line flirts with thematic echo, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph penalty through concrete action integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in botanical details ("veins of leaves, gradient of petals") and auroral sorrow; voice modulates from precise observation to lyrical compression under pressure, though wanderer’s dialogue slightly converges with Elara’s reflective register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with zero scaffold in climax ("she added to it... turning distortion into new pattern"), but "swaying certainties" metaphor recurs with minimal variation in high-pressure beat, triggering mild synonym churn penalty in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of oracle mythos with botanical fragility feels inevitable, yet "fault-tolerant" framing risks tech-bro jargon; emotional specificity in smudge-as-sacred-loss elevates, though mountain solitude trope lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
