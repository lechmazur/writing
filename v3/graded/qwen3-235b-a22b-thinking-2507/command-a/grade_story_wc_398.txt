<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between seeking connection and accepting space is concrete, but "gently persuasive" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs in action; epiphany earned though flaw lacks tangible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("dance with mismatches") reweights destiny concept with conceptual cost, but cost remains abstract—no visceral felt price in final image despite strong lens coherence (Accumulative).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and vineyard symmetry effectively mirror internal state, but setting doesn't constrain choices; recurring letter charges final image though micro-setting (pavilion) lacks tactical pressure for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (mismatches as barrier to love) deepen through reflection, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—realization emerges passively without narrowing options or visible tactical cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vineyard metaphor ("vines lean but never touch") perfectly crystallizes theme; final image reweights "destiny" without moralizing, transforming abstract concept into resonant embodied truth through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing vine symmetry, letter's texture) sustains voice, though "intersubjective understanding" momentarily drifts from plausible lexicon; consistent focalization avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("gently persuasive," "nurture connections") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she thought") in reflection beats; no closure artifacts but density falters during internal monologue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard mechanics with love metaphors avoids cliché; emotional specificity in burned letter detail transforms familiar "mismatch" premise through character-grounded observation.</comment>
