<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority (breath visible, fingers lingering) but "surge of something she couldn’t name" edges toward diagnostic label-speak; scholar’s abrupt "You’re late" lacks sufficient motivation for relationship pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (shared heartbeat rhythm, fade now calling) with felt cost of irrevocable change, but scholar’s "He knew you’d need this" risks thematic echo undermining causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (narrowing path, guiding light) and charges final image; "living tapestry" cliché slightly dilutes specificity but compensated by tactile pendant interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as pendant shifts from delivery object to active choice-maker, but scholar’s revelation feels coincidental rather than earned by Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Theme emerges organically through vibration/germination motifs, but scholar’s line "He knew you’d need this" borders on thematic echo, nearly triggering Q5 penalty for final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing pendant’s wings catching light) and rhythmic control under pressure; minor scaffold in "jittery" repetition but payoff in earned voice modulation from anxiety to wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("breath visible," "hum intensifying") but simultaneity error: "ridgeway seemed to shift... aurora pulsing" blurs cause/effect in pivotal beat, dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of relic-as-active-chooser transforms trope; vibration mechanic grounds emotional arc in concrete physics. Avoids safety middle by making wonder feel earned through specific sensory shifts.</comment>
