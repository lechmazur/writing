<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear vs. duty) drives withholding revelation, but emotional stakes remain intellectualized; "heart heavy but unburdened" lacks embodied specificity during pivotal confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: ripples' pattern shift crystallizes stance with felt cost ("heart heavy but unburdened"), though lens clarity at midpoint slightly falters during reflective block.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian platform and magnetic grotto constrain choice (stone-throwing ritual) and charge final image ("starlight brighter"); "sycamore hush" evolves from atmosphere to thematic anchor in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through trance-deepening escalation (ripple patterns → colleagues' faces), but cost remains abstract; "unburdened" heart lacks visceral tradeoff despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone-throwing ritual rather than moralizing; final image reweights "vanishing" as active revelation, but "balance achieved" edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in grotto's hum/starlight interplay, yet "weight of mission" abstraction breaks POV modesty during high-pressure revelation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero prose loops, but "heart heavy but unburdened" introduces mild abstraction in closure beat; otherwise, lyrical precision ("sycamore hush," ripple patterns) sustains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Backwards aging transformed via magnetic grotto's truth-amplification mechanic; specificity of etched stone and pond-rings metaphor avoids trope, though "vanishing to appear" risks abstraction.</comment>
