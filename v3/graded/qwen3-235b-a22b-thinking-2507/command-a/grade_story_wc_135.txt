<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("fingers trembled") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet untested under pressure until climax, missing micro-choices that would elevate to 8.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with cost ("absences no longer voids but spaces waiting to be filled"), but cost legibility lacks pinpoint specificity; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though escalation could deepen pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Harbor setting actively constrains choices (sand softening, cliff access) and charges final image; "ocean-spray" sensory specificity reflects urgency while avoiding cliché, meeting 9+ gate with environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering lost stories) tightens via valve's activation, but pressure escalation lacks visible cost until closure; agency in playing the valve forecloses exile's silence, though secondary cost remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("navigated absences" reweighted as "spaces waiting to be filled"), avoiding moralizing; final image resonates non-literally with emotional honesty, though thematic complexity edges toward simplicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water pooled in patterns almost alive") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from observational to transcendent without head-hopping, with elision (keeper's origin) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "reactively visionary" label in peak beat triggers minor artifact penalty; propulsion strong though one metaphor ("stirring the air like a wake") slightly strains physical logic without pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through oceanic specificity and "navigated absences" conceptual twist; risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes coherently, with fresh inflection in harbor-as-living-archive.</comment>
