<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("sighed," "felt a pull") and micro-choices in deconstruction, but motivation ("discover what trees witness") lacks contradictory impulses; abstract epiphany about "resilience" edges toward unearned wisdom without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands perfectly: "the weight of what trees witness" crystallizes cost through accumulated sorrow, with moonlight as persistent constraint. Accumulative lens holds through dream-coalescence pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moonlight functions as active micro-setting—constraining repair ("heals in moonlight") and charging the final image ("bathed in moonlight"). Sextant's brass/glass details filter through Elias's maintenance POV, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: deconstructing the sextant narrows options to moonlight-dependent healing, with "accumulation of lives" as visceral cost. Single deepening suffices, but "quantified sorrow" transforms tactics without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (child planting tree, shattered glass mending), avoiding moralizing. Final line "testament to the sorrow that heals in moonlight" reweights premise without stating a moral, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight painted the stone in silver," "soft hum of dreams") with rhythmic control: shorter sentences during repair ("Each piece he removed revealed...") modulate pressure. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mundane miracles unfolding" avoids purple prose. Final line "beacon of what trees witness" charges closure with high density. Syntactic variety ("The sextant wasn't just broken; it was a vessel...") propels momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "broken object" trope via specific logic (sextant as dream-mapping tool). "Quantified sorrow" feels fresh, avoiding abstraction. Risk in quiet closure pays off through moonlight constraint, resisting middle-ground hedging.</comment>
