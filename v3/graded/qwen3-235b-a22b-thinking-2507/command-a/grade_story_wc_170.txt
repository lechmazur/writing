<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; calmness remains untested until cost manifests. Strengths: embodied cost (trembling hands), meaningful sacrifice. Weakness: no visible internal struggle during resistance phase, reducing earnedness of final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with heartbeat cost ("fainter, borrowed and shared"). Orientation clear by word 30. But lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural pressure (lullaby density) undermined by causal phrasing ("mirrors surrendered"), weakening escalation logic at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains choice (wet glass enables refraction crucial to her art) and charges final image ("shimmered one final time"). Weakness: terrace lacks spatial choreography—no sense of mirror placement or movement paths, creating white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early; pressure tightens via three-note structure. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—the mirrors "surrender" passively when bells toll, reducing Elara’s role to catalyst rather than active resolver. Cost (heartbeat) is visible but not earned through tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirage vignettes (child singing, etc.), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights prism parapet as memorial ("silent farewell"), offering non-literal answer to "possibility vs. reflection." Near-slip: "borrowed heartbeat to change the world" risks sentimentality but redeemed by concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight fractured through wet glass") and rhythmic control via lullaby cadence. No head-hopping; reflection fragments anchored to song. Weakness: "perceptively calm" repeated as label without embodied contradiction under stress, flattening interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero closure-adjacent artifacts; final line charges closure ("shimmered one final time"). But near-synonym loops ("perceptively calm," "elusive") and stacked lyricism ("air hummed with promise of renewal... spectrum of colors") risk overwriting in opening beat, dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms mirror trope through specific mechanics (lullabies, heartbeat sacrifice). Emotional truth in vignettes elevates beyond template. But "borrowed heartbeat" concept lacks freshness—it echoes familiar life-force tropes without distinctive logic or cost reweighting.</comment>
