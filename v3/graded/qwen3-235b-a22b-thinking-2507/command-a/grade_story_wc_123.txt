<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows Elias’s "meticulous" nature driving choices (e.g., timing guard patrols), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal decisions; solitude vs. action resolves too neatly without visible cost beyond abstract unease.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: courtyard’s reconfiguration as "what’s worth protecting" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (sacrificed solitude), though the alley-to-wasteland transition lacks causal texture, slightly diluting escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard’s "layered tranquility" actively pressures Elias’s choice to leave, and the message tube (as micro-setting) constrains action; final image recharges it with undeniable cost, meeting Q3’s 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as Elias infiltrates the compound (e.g., guard patrols narrowing options), but early conflict lacks teeth—the "follower" vanishes without altering tactics, weakening initial pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "integrity" manifests in storm-data verification, not abstraction; final line ("ready to face the storm") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (e.g., noticing "frayed parchment edges" as a recorder), but stress compression falters—prose remains overly polished during high-tension infiltration, missing rhythmic urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts; message tube recurrence avoids synonym churn. Minor loop: "credibly curious" label repeated verbatim during courtyard tension, slightly flattening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine tropes via storm-science lens; Elias’s occupation isn’t decorative but essential to plausibility. Risk-taking (quiet resolve over action climax) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
