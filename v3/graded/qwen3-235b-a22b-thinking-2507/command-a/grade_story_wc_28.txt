<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interiority relies on abstract labels ("heart both warm and cold") without embodied contradiction; retrocognition trait lacks micro-choices under pressure when she touches the mosaic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure; "mercy though aberrant now" crystallizes conceptual cost. Lens ambiguity early (retrocognition vs. sensory accumulation) prevents 8.8+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minaret mosaic functions as micro-setting but fails 9+ gate: ash brushing lacks tactile consequence, "shattered sky" mirrors state overtly ("seemed to soften") violating subtlety rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake clear but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs; mosaic rearrangement presents no narrowed options (e.g., no cost like ruined hands altering tactics) despite conceptual cost in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "aberrant mercy" integrates through concrete mosaic work. Final line edges toward thematic echo but escapes penalty by being Elara's hope, not authorial statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythmic control strong ("hands moving with purpose that belied gentleness") but focalization slips ("it was here that Elara stood" violates deep POV); abstract nouns ("essence," "transformation") drift from character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" label repeats without variation; "warm and cold" → "gentle and unyielding" creates synonym churn. No closure-impacting loops but minor density issues prevent 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via semantic renewal ("renaming reality"), but "gentle radical" borders on stock phrasing; emotional specificity in mosaic work lifts to 8.5+.</comment>
