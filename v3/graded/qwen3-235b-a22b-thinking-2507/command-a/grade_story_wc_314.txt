<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is weak; the "secretly sentimental" trait doesn't alter choices. Final epiphany is told ("she understood") not embodied, triggering diagnostic label-speak penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with starling patterns deepening meaning, but cost legibility fails—the "shift within herself" lacks concrete on-page price. Orientation test passed, yet non-closure accumulation cap applies for two distinct issues (cost proof + lens clarity).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting creates vivid atmosphere ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "dew-kissed grass") but never constrains choices; the orchard remains a postcard. Micro-setting (crystal) charges closure as "bridge," narrowly avoiding the 8.8 cap for Q3.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("harmonize logic and intuition") are signaled early but pressure never tightens meaningfully—the flame interruption adds mystery without raising cost. Agency isn't tested; her hesitation resolves instantly with no trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal/flame motifs but final paragraph states the moral outright ("logic and intuition could indeed dance together"), triggering -0.6 thematic echo penalty. Avoids binaries yet sermonizing undercuts earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing starling patterns and "ancient freshness," with rhythmic control during the altar scene. Minor scaffold in "secretly sentimental" telling, but no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong density in orchard descriptions, but paraphrase loops ("air hummed with the touch of wonder" / "orchard seemed to hold its breath") and closure overwriting ("weaver of wonder, keeper of balance") trigger minor artifact deductions. No filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and starling patterns avoids tropes, but "harmony" theme feels familiar. Transformation test fails—swap "alchemist" for "sage" and logic holds. Emotional specificity in her quiet discovery elevates mid-band.</comment>
