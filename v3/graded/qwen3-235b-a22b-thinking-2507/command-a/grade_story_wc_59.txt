<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("bitterly sweet truth," "spark of determination") without embodied contradiction; final realization lacks visible struggle against flaws. Diagnostic phrasing in peak beats triggers penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "beauty could not be forced" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("sacrifice, patience"). Causal lens holds through machine activation and vision, though egg's mechanical taint feels under-motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid (luminescent fungi, stalactites) but setting doesn't constrain choices; suspended palace is postcard backdrop. Micro-setting potential in egg's glow fails to charge final image beyond symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through assembling machine fragments, narrowing options to accepting flawed genesis. Conceptual cost ("progress over preservation") legible in final reckoning, though mechanical world's threat remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through egg/machine juxtaposition; final image ("chance to rewrite the story") avoids moralizing. Near-miss on 9+ due to "bitterly sweet truth" bordering on thematic echo in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (damp stone scent, fungal glow) modulates with pressure. Stress tics ("heart quaking," "trembling hands") slightly converge in peak beats, but rhythmic control elevates closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minor scaffold ("frayed and stained" then "bedraggled"); final paragraph's semicolon cadence slightly dulls momentum. No fatal artifacts, but overwriting in "crystalline spires glinting faintly in the dim glow" nips 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Flawed genesis as conscious choice" transforms mechanical-world trope through specific moral calculus. Emotional truth in quiet resolve offsets derivative prince archetype; risk-taking in Charged Poise ending pays off cohesively.</comment>
