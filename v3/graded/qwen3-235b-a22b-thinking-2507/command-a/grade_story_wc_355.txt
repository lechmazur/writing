<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "path to empathy" borders on diagnostic label-speak but avoids penalty through embodied action. Motivation clear but no visible struggle or cost beyond emotional longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "recovered a piece of her own identity" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, though cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Diary clasp functions as micro-setting charging final image (cradled diary), but workshop environment remains atmospheric without constraining choices. Meets 9+ gate via recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("catalog varieties of silence") deepen meaning but stay abstract; no concrete obstacle beyond the lock. One tightening (unlocking) lacks visceral cost—emotional recovery feels unearned by prior struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final whisper ("Thank you") reweights silence theme without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "path to empathy" phrasing through concrete particulars (diary pages as testament).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tuning frequencies," sensory hierarchy) with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor tense inconsistency ("grandmother sitting") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; single mixed metaphor ("shadows danced like old friends" vs. earlier deepening shadows) causes minor coherence dip but doesn’t dull closure. Zero loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "cataloging silence" trope through specific frequency method, but risk-taking mild. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates; transformation test passed.</comment>
