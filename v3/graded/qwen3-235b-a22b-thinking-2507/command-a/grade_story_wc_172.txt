<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (amoral vs. sentimental) are clear but lack sufficient micro-choices under pressure; "trembling hands" shows embodied cost weakly. Internal conflict alternates in summaries rather than simultaneous action during the egg placement climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: rain washing salt while egg is buried reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("fragment of her own lost humanity"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors within 100 words. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Salt flat actively constrains choices (resisting footsteps, revealing damp earth) and charges the final image (rain transforming salt). But "thunder rumbling like a warning" uses generic sensory cliché, slightly diluting specificity at the lull moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving extinct birds) tightens as cracks align and depression is found, narrowing options to one sanctuary. Cost is felt in her "fractured grace" realization, but external conflict (drought consequences) remains aftermath rather than viscerally tested on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salt flat’s transformation (rain washing barrenness) and egg burial without moralizing. Final image reweights "fractured grace" as earned complexity, but backstory-heavy motivation slightly outsizes on-page struggle for the length.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("earth shimmered like a cracked mirror" reflecting guilt) with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "fractured grace" leans toward thematic abstraction during peak action, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with varied syntax, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("her mission was not one of charity, but of preservation—a secret she guarded fiercely") and weak modifiers ("faint prints," "sparse at first") reduce density in early beats. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eco-guilt through salt flat specificity and "map of cracks" motif, avoiding redemption clichés. Emotional truth anchors the premise, but "amoral philanthropist" archetype lacks transformative risk-taking beyond established tropes.</comment>
