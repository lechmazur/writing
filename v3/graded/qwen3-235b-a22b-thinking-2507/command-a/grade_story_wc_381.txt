<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("profound sense of peace") with limited embodied contradiction; micro-choices under pressure are minimal beyond ritual execution. Flaws like "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats undercut visceral stakes despite consistent motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("weight of responsibility") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by 100 words. Escalation lacks one tangible resistance beat beyond metaphorical "thrashing," narrowly missing 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting charging final image (sky reflection), but environment doesn't constrain choices earlier. Sensory details vivid yet occasionally generic ("damp earth"); crane wing elevates via closure linkage but haven remains postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing prophecy) tightens through one meaningful deepening (wing's glow intensifying), but escalation lacks felt consequence—prophecy's "thrashing" stays abstract without altering tactics. Cost ("vigilance") is legible yet underweighted in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "silence as weapon and shield" motif; final line reweights "tranquil blaze" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "cosmic forces" phrasing risks abstraction, narrowly missing 9.0 due to underdeveloped moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listening to the void between breaths") with rhythmic control, but filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates well though "profound peace" label clashes with stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("gurgle of water"/"brook’s gurgle") and elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic") trigger -0.4 accumulation cap. Propulsion strong but figurative muddle in "weaving threads of moonlight" slightly dulls closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami/cosmic mechanics transforms summoner trope, though "solitary" archetype lacks risk. Emotional specificity in vigilance motif elevates, but "terrestrially cosmic" feels more decorative than transformative for the premise.</comment>
