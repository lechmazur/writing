<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; "gently persistent" label appears twice without embodied cost during key reveals like the widow encounter, weakening micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("future uncertain, but together"), but the sanctions' tangible impact remains abstract; a single concrete loss (e.g., depleted food stores) would tighten the escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor evolves from setting to beacon, but ridge geography never constrains choices; "cracked tiles" motif lacks causal pressure despite vivid atmosphere, narrowly missing 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sanctions create abstract stakes without live trade-offs; the gathering declaration forecloses isolation, yet no visible cost (e.g., ration sacrifice) narrows options during escalation, weakening the Accumulative pressure build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through bell symbolism, but "intergenerational support" remains told rather than dramatized through conflict; the final image resonates yet lacks the non-literal reweighting required for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind whispered secrets") shines, but "amplified quiet" reads as authorial intrusion; stress compression falters during widow scene where lyrical phrasing dilutes heartbeat-pounding urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("dwindling like embers"/"dying fire"); no closure-dulling artifacts, but "gently persistent" repetition slightly muddies peak-beat propulsion without thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh bell symbolism transforms exile tropes, yet terra-cotta arbor lacks verifiable specificity; risk-taking in quiet closure succeeds but avoids bold stakes escalation, capping near-band high.</comment>
