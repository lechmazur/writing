<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through "weary yet determined" eyes and "cost him everything" sacrifices, but motivation ("shape a new dawn") remains abstract despite vivid embodied details like trembling hands on the portico. Near-diagnostic phrasing in climax ("unwavering belief") slightly undermines grit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the etched portico and "bittersweet expression" crystallize stakes with felt cost ("work far from over"). Accumulative escalation through storm intensity and radio frequency density holds the lens, though the radio voice's origin ambiguity risks causality thinness in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory creates vivid atmosphere but functions decoratively; the portico's transformation charges the ending image yet fails to constrain earlier choices (e.g., no physical interaction limits Elias' actions). Strong sensory specificity in "cobalt surface rippling like water" lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' escalating urgency ("visions grew vivid, more urgent"), but the "variant allegiance" choice lacks visceral trade-offs—the cost ("bittersweet expression") feels abstract rather than embodied. Agency remains passive (receiving visions), weakening the pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through portico symbolism ("bridge between worlds") and final "gritty, whimsical hope" image, avoiding moralizing. The dawn reconfiguration offers non-literal answer to "ancient shadows vs new dawn" without stated morals, though "shadows that shaped humanity" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispers of the future," "gritty whimsy") and rhythmic control shine in storm climax with fragmented syntax. Radio voice dialogue carries subtext through sparse commands, but "unfolding a new one" phrasing risks thematic echo near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "fragments of the future that came to him in dreams, in whispers, and through fragmented radio frequencies" shows synonym churn. Elevated diction ("lyrically prophetic") slightly drifts from Elias' voice, though final image's concrete "wind carrying first light" saves momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes via radio frequencies as divine conduit and "gritty whimsy" tone, but observatory visionary archetype lacks freshness. Emotional truth in sacrifice outweighs familiarity, though the portico's cobalt glass feels derivative of common "magical object" tropes without unique constraints.</comment>
