<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (methodical vs curiosity) drives choice to hum; "cage" realization shows embodied cost. Lacks deeper backstory on why this mural matters to her personally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "certainty had been a cage" crystallizes conceptual cost. Orientation test passed early but lens ambiguity in "exchange certainty" demand slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden’s metallic flowers constrain tactics (humming to activate mural), but spatial choreography falters during figure emergence. "Polished obsidian" eyes charge final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs curiosity) tightens via coin’s animation, but conceptual cost lacks tangible pressure. "Cage" metaphor reweights options cleanly though felt cost remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "cage" metaphor without moralizing; final image reweights "permanence of art" with conceptual cost. Avoids sentimentality while embracing complexity of artistic vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused noticing ("resonant hum," "vibrations of distant echoes"); rhythmic control peaks during humming sequence. Slight genericism in "whirlwind of confusion."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but "breath catching" cliché and filter verbs ("she noticed") dilute immediacy. Final line’s "threads in the tapestry" achieves high density without muddle, though "heart raced" feels tell-y.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound physics and mural restoration avoids magical realism tropes; emotional specificity in "methodically playful" trait. Transformation test passed—swapping names would break sensory logic.</comment>
