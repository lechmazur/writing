<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (people's suffering) and change is earned through the barter choice, but "quietly determined" remains label-only without embodied contradiction during the mine descent. Interiority lacks stress-induced degradation at pivotal moments like the core weaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the ambiguous transformation ("more and less himself") crystallizes options with felt cost, and causal lens holds. However, the cost isn't visually anchored until the surface return, creating a slight lag in legibility during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard planet's floating arches constrain choice (path to mines) and charge the final image with blooming vines. The forge's molten metal/fruit duality perfectly mirrors Eli's internal state, with sensory details filtered through his blacksmith perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from barter to descent, but the mine journey lacks meaningful pressure—no tangible setbacks test Eli's resolve. The "treacherous" shafts read as narrative assertion rather than dramatized obstacles narrowing options under stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the silk's transformation: resilience isn't triumph but ambiguous awakening. Final image reweights "coaxed resilience from rubble" without moralizing, though the "meek blacksmith" label slightly oversimplifies Eli's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in forge-related details ("precision born of years"), but stress compression during the core weaving lacks syntactic variation. Minor register drift occurs in "vessel for awakenings" dialogue, feeling less voice-motivated than the stranger's other lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, with strong propulsion in descent sequence. However, "shimmering like liquid light" overwrites the silk's introduction, and "jagged teeth" simile later creates mild metaphor dissonance in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms the "barter with stranger" trope through specific stakes (planetary core weaving) and emotional truth in Eli's quiet sacrifice. The orchard planet's duality feels fresh, though "azure defiance" risks proximity to common fantasy color symbolism without deeper reinvention.</comment>
