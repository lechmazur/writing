<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority strong with concrete embodiment ("clutched cog," "abrasive calm masking turmoil"), but Lira’s shift from mockery to alliance lacks sufficient motivation. Kael’s change occurs off-page during "weeks turned into weeks," violating emotional progression realism with unearned hope. Contradictory impulses (logic vs. madness) act simultaneously early but fade during pivotal decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing with cost (worldview shift), but the critical turning point—"flicker of hope"—happens off-page during unshown weeks, breaking causality. Collapse news forces action, yet the actual change (accepting Lira’s narrative) lacks on-page escalation. Orientation solid within 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred by midpoint and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sewer/sunken city grounds sensory specificity ("scent of decay," sedimentary layers), but the chronometer cog shines as micro-setting: constrains choices (clutched during conflict), charges closure ("realized his story was not over" while holding it). Avoids white-room syndrome; environmental details mirror internal states through tactile use ("polished with a rag").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (past preservation vs. future progress) signaled early, but escalation falters—the clash with Lira resolves off-page without visible cost. Collapse creates urgency, yet no tangible price (e.g., sacrificing artifacts) charges the final image. Band guardrail fails: tightening forecloses no live option; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through artifacts and conflict, but final paragraph commits Thematic Echo: "threads in the same tapestry" states the thesis explicitly, violating "resists tidy morals." Avoids sermonizing until closure, where "room for both" oversimplifies the complex narrative struggle, triggering -0.7 penalty per anti-pattern guidance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight filtered through grates, a mocking reminder") and rhythmic control under pressure. Lira’s dialogue ("world’s moved on") carries subtext but verges on expository; slight register mismatch in "rationally rebellious" label. Avoids head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during Kael’s realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "thought of losing... was agonizing, but thought of staying... was worse" shows minor paraphrase loop (-0.2). No figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("cog clutched tightly... realized his story was not over") crystallizes tension. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though one template cadence ("Kael...") appears mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transforms post-plague trope through specific details (seafarer’s cog, sedimentary layers), but resolution ("room for both") avoids bold risk, hedging into safety middle. Emotional truth in Kael’s trauma feels fresh, yet the reconciliation arc follows predictable template without non-obvious moral calculus, failing Derivative Premise Guardrail.</comment>
