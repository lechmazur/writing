<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (professional detachment vs urgency) is embodied in silt-covered arches and raw hands, but "stoically sensitive" label and "hushed blaze" cliché trigger diagnostic slip penalties; journal discovery hardens resolve without showing competing impulses in the act itself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the pulsing mosaic—cost visible in Elias's raw hands and "strange lightness," reconfiguring absence as active force under Accumulative/Textural lens; one tightening (journal discovery to resolve hardening) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silt-constrained movements and inkwell's brass surface directly charge final image; "hands reaching upward" carvings mirror mosaic payoff, but "scent of brine and decay" leans generic, missing full micro-setting constraint potential for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (silt depth, fading ink) narrowing options toward mosaic discovery; journal wrest tightens resolve, but "hushed blaze" repetition dilutes tension's causal progression under Accumulative lens despite sufficient deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silt-covered hands and pulsing stars reweighting absence, avoiding moralizing; near-miss with "hushed blaze of connection" echoing prompt-like language in mosaic scene, narrowly escaping Q5 penalty for thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct surveyor lexicon ("foundation repairs," "interlaced absence") and rhythmic control shine, but "hushed blaze" repetition creates accidental cadence loop under pressure, disrupting perceptual signature at journal discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density in "waterlogged journal" discovery beat, but template cadence ("stepped," "waded," "bending") triggers −0.4 loop penalty; "hushed blaze" reuse in final third avoids closure damage but caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor-as-archeologist transforms trope through silt-encrusted carvings and inkwell tradition; emotional specificity in "raw hands/strange lightness" avoids abstraction, though "dreams drowning" premise lacks full novelty transformation.</comment>
