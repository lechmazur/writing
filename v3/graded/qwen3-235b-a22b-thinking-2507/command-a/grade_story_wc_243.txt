<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority stays abstract ("sense of purpose," "heart swelling") without contradictory impulses; "haunted euphoria" triggers diagnostic label penalty. Mara's exposition resolves conflict without friction, undermining earned motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure ("promise of what could still be"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—Mara's exposition resolves everything conveniently without narrowing options or felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting with strong sensory texture (jasmine/salt, walnut ink), but "blooming" motif remains decorative; fails 9+ gate as it doesn’t constrain choices beyond final lyrical reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserve stories) signaled early but pressure never tightens—Mara’s exposition eliminates conflict without trade-offs or visible cost. "Gently thorough" trait isn’t tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locket/covenant, but final line states thesis ("not just about the past—it was about the promise"), violating Q5 anti-pattern for final-paragraph moralizing with -0.7 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals unfolding in silent celebration"), but "haunted euphoria" is therapy-speak, and Mara’s dialogue lacks subtext ("That’s my grandmother"), flattening voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("her movements deliberate, as if..."; "thoughts drifted") and synonym churn ("weight of small moments" x3), but no artifacts dull closure. "Hum with untold stories" cliché slightly muddles density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Archivist trope transformed via "walnut ink" specificity, but "blooming jetty" feels generic. Emotional truth in preservation theme lacks bold risk-taking; derivative covenant framing caps originality.</comment>
