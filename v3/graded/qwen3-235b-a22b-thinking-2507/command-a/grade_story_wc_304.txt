<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (fear of stillness vs pattern-seeking) act simultaneously in revival scene; traveler’s wisdom feels slightly unearned but her micro-choices (“Teach me”) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost in the realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (“true motivation had never been to capture sparks”) under Accumulative lens; aurora’s shift and traveler’s disappearance crystallize reconfigured stakes without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (dimming after purpose fulfilled) and charges final image; aurora’s evolution reflects internal shift but grotto backdrop lacks spatial pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s internal renunciation (“understand the stillness”) with felt cost in her trembling realization; escalation driven by pattern accumulation (static → stillness) under Accumulative lens, though traveler’s insight edges on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (aurora hues, chip’s glow) with final image reweighting “capture sparks” into embracing stillness; traveler’s dialogue risks thematic echo but avoids moralizing via embodied cost in Elara’s posture shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“lucidly watchful,” “radiant hush”) with rhythmic control under pressure; sentence compression during revival (“Elara stepped back, her heart pounding”) heightens tension without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“infusing the traveler’s features with a lifelike glow”) with clear propulsion; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the chip’s activation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Beautician mortician” transforms mortuary tropes through specific voice (“skyborne grotto,” aurora-hued eyes); emotional truth in embracing stillness avoids safety middle but emerald chip verges on familiar relic archetype.</comment>
