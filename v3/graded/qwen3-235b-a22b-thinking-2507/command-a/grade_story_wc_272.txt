<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in card-sorting micro-choices ("not to restore but rearrange"), though "luminescent ache" edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of the box earns closure through prior causality of fragmentation acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ascending staircase crystallizes options with felt cost ("ache remained, no longer burden"). Accumulative lens holds through card-rearrangement pressure, reweighting Tower’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: tarot cards constrain choices (sorting method shifts reality perception) and charge final image ("carried... redesigned reality"). Lighthouse groans mirror internal pressure without overt symbolism, but ocean remains decorative backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency—card rearrangement narrows options from despair to active reconstruction. Cost crystallizes in "luminescent pulse" shifting from pain to possibility, with walls receding as direct consequence of her choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through card symbolism’s transformation (Tower→renewal), avoiding moralizing. Weakness: grandmother’s "art is truth" line borders on thematic echo, slightly undermining earned resonance of final "ache as guide" realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in salt-paper sensory details and tarot-focused observation. Rhythmic control excels during sorting sequence ("slow, painful, but necessary"), though "spectral presence" cliché slightly dilutes voice precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shards of shattered mirror" metaphor integrates cleanly. Minor register drift in "luminescent ache" risks therapy-speak but avoids penalty through embodied context (chest pulse guiding hands).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tarot as fragmentation tool (not fortune-telling) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but lighthouse setting risks genre cliché despite fresh library twist; specificity saves it from derivative status.</comment>
