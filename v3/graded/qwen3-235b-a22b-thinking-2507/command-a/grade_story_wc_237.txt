<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in stress-triggered quill crystallization versus her goal of calm, but epiphany edges toward tidy resolution; scars' emotional weight lacks sufficient friction in pivotal "fear of storm" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (scars reweighted as symbols), but the Accumulative lens weakens when rain cessation resolves tension too neatly; quill's recrystallization lacks visible tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Crow quill perfectly functions as micro-setting—its stress-crystallization constrains choices and charges the final image; floating platform's atmospheric sway integrates flawlessly though physical stakes remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via sensory density (rain tapping, quill shimmering), but the single tightening—breath control reversing crystallization—feels internally driven without sufficient external pressure compounding her anxiety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through quill/scars imagery without moralizing; final line ("scars... symbols of her journey") delivers resonant conceptual repricing, though emotional transformation leans slightly toward resolution over lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "saturated hush" and elastic time metaphors; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("Not again," short clauses), but minor telling ("felt a sense of peace") slightly dilutes embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical precision with zero scaffold or loops; "crystallizing like frost" exemplifies high-density imagery, though "symbol of her newfound calm" risks thematic echo without sufficient prior tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scholarly rigor and superstition through rune-carving scars; crow quill's stress-crystallization elevates trope into specific emotional barometer, though floating platform setting edges toward familiar fantasy convention.</comment>
