<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's embodied fear manifests through the clasp's flickering images, but "fear of being forgotten" lacks contradictory impulses during the climax. Advisor's shadowy status shifts remain superficial despite the "repulsive allure" motif.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with funhouse dissolution, but "fear dies in understanding" risks thematic echo. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through luminance/mirror density, though clock room feels like a forced escalation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Opera cloak clasp functions as micro-setting: its curse constrains choices (fear capture) and charges the final image. Dust, warped mirrors, and luminance evolve causally with Clara's resolve, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (confronting fear's weakness) tighten meaningfully when mirrors shift reality, but "time bends to your will" undermines agency. Cost is legible in the funhouse's dissolution, though fear's acknowledgment feels intellectually neat rather than viscerally earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the clasp's duality (curse/tool), but "fear dies in understanding" crosses into final-paragraph moralizing. Advisor's paradoxical wisdom avoids sentimentality yet lacks counter-readings for true complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warped reflections," "cracks in resolve") modulates with pressure. Tense shifts ("mind drifted," "dreamed") cleanly signal dream states, though "repulsive allure" repeats as unearned interior label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" overuse creates synonym churn in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stack ("fingers traced," "mind racing") dulls immediacy during dictionary scene, but final image's "dying star" metaphor avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms carnival tropes through specific fear mechanics (photographic curse, paradoxical notes). Bold risk in Earned Stasis closure, though "advisor's respect" slightly softens the stakes' emotional truth. No derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
