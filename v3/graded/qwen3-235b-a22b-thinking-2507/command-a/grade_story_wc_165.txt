<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Elias’s motivation is clear but untested by stakes. Diagnostic label "monotony was the enemy" triggers penalty without embodied cost. Final choice (walking away) isn’t earned by prior causality—no visible trade-offs or struggle during the act. Strengths include consistent micro-choices (noting patterns), but flaws cap score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "his work far from over" crystallizes the cost of endless serendipity labor under Accumulative lens. Starlight beam on the bishop reweights randomness with conceptual cost. Lens holds consistently through observed details, but cost lacks visceral immediacy to reach 9.0. No orientation debt or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: the skylight alignment forces the climax, and the bishop’s glint charges the final image. Sensory details (starlight, pigeon coos) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding cliché. Micro-setting (chess piece) meets 9+ gate by shaping the closure. Economy is flawless—no ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (monotony vs. wonder) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation; Elias succeeds effortlessly without trade-offs. Pressure deepens through crowd reactions, but no on-page tightening choice narrows options or alters tactics. Cost ("work far from over") is legible but not dramatized as a consequence of agency. Strong accumulation falls short of 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bishop’s reweighted symbolism but undermined by final-paragraph moralizing ("magic could happen—if only you knew how to look"). Avoids tidy binaries yet suffers thematic echo in "Life is a game" speech. Resonant ending image almost compensates, but redundancy caps score below 8.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lightly attentive gaze," "calculated wilderness") modulates tone effectively. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays consistent. Minor register drift in "analytical street performer" feels clinical for lyrical context. Strengths in rhythmic control, but not quite 9.0 due to slight voice-convergence risk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "orchestrated serendipity" repetition and thematic echo in final lines trigger -0.3 loop penalty. No figurative muddle—prose propels smoothly—but redundancy in "serenade monotony" dulls closure impact. Strong ear test; minor artifacts prevent 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess piece conducting randomness transforms a familiar trope. Specific details (bishop’s diagonal mirroring crowd movements) create organic originality without gimmickry. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently. Lacks one bold inflection to reach 9.0, but avoids derivative safety.</comment>
