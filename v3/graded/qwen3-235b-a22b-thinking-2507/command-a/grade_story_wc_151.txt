<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation ("discover meaning in margins") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; no visible internal struggle or micro-choices under pressure beyond single-minded focus. Her "carefully inventive" trait remains stated rather than demonstrated through tradeoffs during decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via the final line’s reweighting of surface mail’s purpose ("remind it of what it once was"), with felt cost in "echoes of the past remained, waiting." However, the letter retrieval lacks tangible stakes escalation, softening the pressure arc under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Golden arcade setting creates vivid juxtaposition (chalk drawings vs. mosaics), but static description fails to constrain choices—Lyra’s actions would work identically elsewhere. The ebony clipboard’s tactile presence in key beats partially compensates by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("time running out") tighten meaningfully when coordinates point to the mailbox, but tension deflates instantly upon successful retrieval. No visible cost or tactical shift occurs during the climax, weakening escalation under Causal lens despite early urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of historical preservation emerges through concrete details (chalk codes, surface mail), but final moralizing ("remind it of what it once was") crosses into Thematic Echo, undermining earned resonance. The "futuristic nostalgia" insight feels stated rather than discovered through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lyra’s observational focus ("traced the chalk marks," "watermark symbol she recognized"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. Minor POV drift occurs when describing the arcade’s "testament to craftsmanship" as external observation rather than character-filtered detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong concrete propulsion ("knelt," "traced," "trembling hands") anchors key beats, but "futuristic nostalgia" label appears twice as therapy-speak abstraction. Template cadence in opening ("Lyra, a pseudonym creator...") slightly dulls immediacy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of analog/digital tension feels fresh through sidewalk chalk codes, but "pseudonym creator" profession lacks integration with core conflict. Emotional truth in Lyra’s reverence for physicality avoids cliché, yet risks middle-ground hedging by omitting counterarguments to her mission.</comment>
