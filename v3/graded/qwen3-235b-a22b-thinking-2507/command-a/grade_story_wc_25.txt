<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation shift ("wanted to prove subtlety could outlast force") feels unearned; Mira’s line triggers epiphany without prior internal friction. Diagnostic phrasing ("motivation crystallized") undermines embodied contradiction. Cost remains conceptual, not visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: key turn crystallizes options with felt cost (labyrinth trembling). Situational lens holds—storm/labyrinth pressure forces stance crystallization. Missing one escalation beat where pressure actively narrows options beyond container blockage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choice (impossibly stacked wall, shifting paths) and charge the final image ("labyrinth’s whispers"). Geomagnetic storm pulses through metal, altering navigation. Salt/rust smell unused beyond opening, but micro-setting elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) signaled early via Mira’s line, but pressure lacks coherence—storm doesn’t tangibly alter tactics beyond atmosphere. Agency passive: Eli follows map until Mira hands lock. Cost remains abstract ("realized labyrinth was more than a maze"), not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through walk-identification skill and key’s quiet resolution. Final line avoids moralizing by rooting "quietest voices resonate" in concrete action (key turn, light passage). No thematic echo; Mira’s whispering line earns resonance without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Eli notices "rhythmic clangs," "shadows stretching unnaturally long." Syntax tightens under stress ("geomagnetic storm intensified..."). Mira’s sharp dialogue contrasts Eli’s introspection. "Calculated spontaneity" slightly author-imposed but doesn’t disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold near closure; final line’s rhythm ("quietest voices resonate") delivers propulsion. Minor synonym risk: "felt warm... almost alive" then "key felt heavy," but offset by purposeful density. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms labyrinth trope via sensory specificity (metal corridors, geomagnetic interference) and walk-identification gimmick. "Whispers > shouts" theme lacks fresh inflection; emotional truth in loneliness elevates but doesn’t break new ground. Derivative premise guardrail applies (-0.3).</comment>
