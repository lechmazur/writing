<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; "spiralingly calm" remains label-only despite three mentions. Stranger's embodied pain ("pebbles into a stream") earns credibility but final change feels swift without layered internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("shoulders lighter"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens falters—stranger's transformation lacks causal pressure from guardian's actions. Rain-slicked dock anchors orientation cleanly by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dental mirror charges the final image (stars reflected), but cobalt dock remains decorative. Rain creates atmosphere without constraining choices—fails Q3's 9+ gate requiring setting to alter tactics. Sensory details vivid yet static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (darkness/light) tightens through shutter weaving, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the guardian's passivity undermines pressure. Cost is legible ("heart less heavy") yet feels unearned by the stranger's sudden shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through concrete actions: mirror/shutter patterns reweight "teach darkness stars" without moralizing. Final constellation offers resonant non-literal answer to central question—epitomizes Q5's 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") shines, but "spiralingly" feels forced. Dialogue natural yet sparse; rhythm modulates effectively under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "pebbles into a stream" and synonym loops ("unobtrusive/shadows," "calm/demeanor"). Dental mirror descriptions avoid purple prose, but "spiralingly calm" repetition triggers paraphrase penalty (-0.2).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "wise mentor" trope via dental mirror/weaving—fresh synthesis feels inevitable. Avoids sentimentality through concrete tools, but "teach darkness stars" motivation borders on familiar. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
