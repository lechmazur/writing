<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied struggle ("How could one capture weight of loss in marble?") and Tomas’ spectral guidance directly shapes her breakthrough; avoids epiphany clichés by rooting insight in ribbon/butterfly observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("grief was not something to be solved but something to be carried") crystallized in the final ribbon-tucking gesture; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts from "thundering calm" to migration epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass humming with "weight of centuries" and ribbon’s frayed threads constrain choices—Elara’s chisel work emerges from tactile engagement with environment; final starlight reflection charges closure by mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from "impossible" stone-carving task to earned realization about grief’s nature; single tightening ("grief was a migration") reconfigures options with felt cost in her "lighter" but unresolved emotional state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ribbon/butterfly pattern convergence ("migration of memory") without moralizing; final image of folded wings and carried ribbon offers resonant answer to "shape of collective grief" by rejecting static solutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "glass panes humming" and "breath syncing with rhythm"; controlled lyric compression ("fleeting symphony of color") taught early and paid off in closure’s "wings folded in silent unity" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "frayed but still vibrant" and "thundering calm" achieve textural specificity without overwriting; minor register drift in "collective grief" (abstract noun) avoided by immediate concrete grounding in stone-carving struggle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through stone-carver’s lens: "migration" metaphor gains freshness via ribbon’s woven threads and butterfly flight; avoids safety-middle by embracing ambiguity ("not closure but understanding").</comment>
