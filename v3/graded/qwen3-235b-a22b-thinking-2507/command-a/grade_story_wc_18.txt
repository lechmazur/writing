<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("capture runaway dream") is clear but "firmly grounded" trait remains stated not embodied; no contradictory impulses during climax weakens closure's earned cost despite strong sensory interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with legible cost ("fleeting moment" implying ephemerality), but restoration lacks struggle—breathing method succeeds without tangible pressure, creating minor causality gap in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fog functions as active micro-setting (thickens during work, dissolves with sextant), and frost crunch charges final image; orchard's ruin constrains mood but doesn't materially pressure choices, narrowly missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erasing boundaries) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—breathing method succeeds effortlessly without narrowing options or visible cost during the act itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete dissolution of fog/orchard boundaries, but "boundaries like fog" line risks thematic echo; final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though cost feels under-earned by process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of damp wood," "shadows dance like specters") sustains Accumulative lens; wanderer's dialogue carries subtext without over-explaining, though "glass mountains" simile feels voice-dissonant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "glass mountains" simile creates register drift into abstraction during high-pressure beat; no closure-tainting artifacts, though minor overwriting in atmospheric passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artisanal craft and cosmic longing avoids fantasy tropes; "fog as boundary" metaphor feels organic, though sextant's ease-of-restoration lacks risk distinction needed for 9+.</comment>
