<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking closure vs. opening wounds) is clear but lacks embodied specificity in peak beats; "mind buzzing with fragments" is label-only feeling triggering a -0.4 penalty. Micro-choices like tracing the hourglass reveal values, but emotional progression remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: scars fading with "stories now complete" shows visible cost, and the accumulative/textural lens (density increase via tunnel memories) holds without contradiction. The final image reconfigures the displaced miracle with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (hourglass, coffee mug) constrains choices and charges the final image, but the "meteor hush" lacks tactile constraint on tactics. Tower setting remains atmospheric without evolving to pressure choices—environment doesn't shape tactics beyond object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: tunnel memories deepen knowledge (scars belong to multiple entities), narrowing options to reunion. Cost is legible ("scars on her soul began to fade"), though slightly abstract; one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hourglass reunion and scar imagery without moralizing, but "displaced miracle" leans on abstraction. Final image reweights the premise, yet lacks concrete complexity in the central question—avoids thematic echo but feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (plant telepathy coloring descriptions) and rhythmic control under pressure; "ivy’s voice was clear now" modulates with urgency. Elision (anesthesia backstory) taught early and pays off, though minor overwriting in "sanctuary of stillness" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack ("breath fogging," "gazed") and therapy-speak ("mind buzzing") in opening create scaffold, but no closure-tainting artifacts. High density overall, yet paraphrase loops like "fragments of memories she couldn’t piece together" dull immediacy in early beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Trope transformation via plant telepathy and coffee-ring reading elevates "closure seeker," but "displaced miracle" concept lacks bold risk. Emotional specificity in "scars not just hers" feels inevitable, though premise edges toward abstraction without sufficient concrete grounding.</comment>
