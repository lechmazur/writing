<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" manifests through concrete micro-choices (steering toward quiet sectors) while Mira's internal conflict shows embodied contradiction—restless hands versus easing restlessness—without diagnostic labels. Her closure choice (closing eyes to hear herself) is earned by prior causality with visible cost: weeks of anxiety unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mira's whispered "thank you" crystallizes emotional reconfiguration with legible cost ("anxiety unravel"), under the accumulative/textural lens. Minor deduction as the cost remains internal without tangible forfeiture, though the vial's "pristine clarity" visually anchors the shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storm glass vial functions as indispensable micro-setting—constraining Elias's steering choices and charging the final image ("glow with soft inner light"). Prism terrace's quiet sectors actively pressure tactics, avoiding postcard description through sensory selectivity (jasmine scent during Mira's realization).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency: vial's turbulence forces course correction toward quiet sectors, deepening the dominant stake (Mira's turmoil vs. silence). The indigo shift at prismatic towers reweights emotional pressure, with cost unmistakable in "for the first time in weeks, her anxiety unravel."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the vial as "mirror for the soul," silence as "space where everything can be heard"—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("silence... would stay with her") reweights the premise non-literally, with conceptual cost in Mira's earned self-comfortation replacing Elias's role.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices sound/liquid states ("vial began to swirl"), Mira feels physical sensations ("anxiety unravel"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during vial turbulence), with dialogue carrying subtext ("It's in transit...") without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("Her method was unique—monitoring noise levels..."). High density: "restlessness easing as the gondola continued its serene journey" conveys action, emotion, and setting. Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "quiet healer" trope through storm glass mechanics—silence becomes active teacher ("Silence taught you how to comfort yourself"). Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, with the prism terrace's rules (sound-reactive vial) followed rigorously to Charged Poise closure.</comment>
