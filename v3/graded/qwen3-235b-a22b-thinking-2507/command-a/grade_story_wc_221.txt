<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority rich but abstract; "blessed pariah" status stated not shown through micro-choices under pressure. Epiphany lacks visceral cost escalation despite strong embodied emotion in sky-sketching moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with dawn arrival as Charged Poise closure. Cost of isolation felt but not viscerally legible in final image; "calling" phrasing risks thematic echo without concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observation deck’s patina and compass rose evoke atmosphere but don’t constrain choices. Micro-setting fails gate: gilded applique is touched but never actively shapes tactics or final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stake "turn confusion into exploration" signaled early but lacks escalation; realization emerges from reflection not active choice. No narrowing of options or tangible price paid during pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"True north" concept reweights meaning via dawn realization, but "role as blessed pariah was not a curse, but a calling" borders on thematic echo in final paragraph, diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct poetic rhythm undercuts tension with lyrical abstraction ("echoed silence" repetition feels scaffolded). Perceptual signature strong but register drifts into pseudo-profundity during peak reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Synonym loops in temporal descriptions ("temporally stretched cosmos"/"temporally stretched expanse") dull momentum. Minor scaffold in abstract phrases like "a vision both beautiful and terrifying" without embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation with "true north" perception, but "blessed pariah" trope lacks transformation through lived detail. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens theme without gimmickry.</comment>
