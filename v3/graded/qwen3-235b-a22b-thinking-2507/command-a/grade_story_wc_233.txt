<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear vs determination) shown through embodied actions like "boots crunched against gravel," but flaw (ignorance of kingdom's impact) isn't tested via micro-choices before the infodump revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong orientation and Charged Poise closure ("vowed to restore balance" with conceptual cost), but the star-being's "softly commanding voice" appears abruptly without setup, breaking accumulation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ember grotto functions as micro-setting that charges the closure ("sigh in relief" reweights its glow), though cobalt grotto remains ornamental; sensory details like "scent of ancient stone" reflect urgency perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (cosmic balance) signaled early via dreams, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—queen reacts passively to revelations rather than driving pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thematic echo ruins resonance: "protect the fragile beauty" in final paragraph states the moral, violating earned subtext despite strong particulars like bleeding starlight as lifeblood.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("unease that clawed at her chest") but "softly commanding" becomes a tic; star-being's corporate diction ("lifeblood of this world") disrupts voice in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose artifacts in closure beat: "softly commanding" repeats identically 3x, and "fragile beauty" moralizing dulls the final image, triggering -1.7 artifact penalty disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic stakes with quiet resolve; "lacy menace" transforms generic fantasy menace into textured tone, but avoids gimmickry through emotional specificity in the queen's burden.</comment>
