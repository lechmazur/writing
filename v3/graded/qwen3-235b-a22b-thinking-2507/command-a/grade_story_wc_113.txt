<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("profound sense of peace") without contradictory impulses; motivation clear but lacks visible struggle or blind spots complicating choices. Micro-choices like tracing patterns feel reactive rather than revealing value hierarchies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: ghost vanishing with "faintest echo" and dissolved program charge the final image with conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens via sensory density (water rippling to melody) with no causality breaks; orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere but setting rarely constrains choices; water depth and lanterns supply mood not tactics. The program (micro-setting) charges closure as it dissolves, yet environmental details don’t actively shape middle-beat decisions like wading or decoding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (unraveling the ghost’s code) tighten through accumulating sensory pressure under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ghost guides Clara’s actions. Cost (vanishing, dissolved program) charges the final image yet feels emotionally resolved without trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of music as bridge between life/death emerges through concrete particulars (water-stain notation, humming), avoiding moralizing. Ending’s "music and memory intertwined" offers resonant non-literal answer, though complexity lacks counter-readings—ghost’s gift feels unambiguously redemptive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (musician noticing "gaps between notes") with rhythmic control, but stress compression falters: "breath caught" cliché and uniform lyrical diction during peak tension dilute urgency. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively until climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with minimal loops, but abstract telling ("profound sense of peace") and stock phrases ("breath caught") dilute embodiment. Final image’s "lingering resonance" avoids muddle, though mid-scene redundancies like "water damage creating images" slightly drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Flooded opera house ghost trope transformed via musician’s lens and water-as-notation conceit. Emotional specificity avoids genericity, yet resolution feels predictable—ghost’s vanishing lacks fresh inflection beyond expected closure. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
