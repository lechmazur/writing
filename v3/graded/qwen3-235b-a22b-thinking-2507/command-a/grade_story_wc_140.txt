<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("heart quickened," "fingers trembled") without contradictory impulses or embodied specificity; motivation ("discover texture of memories") lacks friction in choices, reducing stakes to passive observation rather than active pursuit under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands ("texture of memories was... in the act of remembering itself") with felt cost, but the repository container discovery feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens; tides rhythm establishes setting but doesn't concretely narrow options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Containers create vivid atmosphere but function as static backdrop rather than constraining choice; mudflat relics appear passively ("revealed") without altering tactics, missing 9+ gate requirement for environment to charge closure despite strong sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming erased humanity) remains thematic rather than viscerally tested; escalation relies on convenient discovery (container archive) without protagonist agency tightening options or imposing tangible cost beyond realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through fragments ("For the forgotten" label transformation), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights erasure concept with social cost ("guardian of the forgotten"), though "nameless but not invisible" skirts thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("filtering reality differently") lacks rhythmic embodiment under pressure; prose remains uniformly lyrical during high-stakes container discovery without stress-induced compression, muting urgency in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean syntax but final-third artifacts ("breath mingling with salt-laden air") risk overwriting; near-repetition ("layering understanding... layering discoveries") creates minor scaffold, disallowing 9+ despite strong momentum and vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh premise (death certificate survivor as memory archaeologist) elevated by poison label's thematic weight, but shipping container labyrinth feels derivative of common dystopian tropes without transformative specificity in execution.</comment>
