<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("cracked flask mended with gold lacquer") but "luminous regret" remains a label without embodied contradiction in the furnace entry beat; final choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond emotional softening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (coin fixed to her sign, regret softened into resolve) with legible cost, but furnace entry lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens—vision sequence happens to her rather than through active exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Foundry transforms from rain-washed to aflame setting, directly pressuring her choice to enter; kintsugi flask constrains her redemption philosophy and charges the final image ("mend by honoring cracks").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding names' weight) deepens via visions, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "exploring limits" method isn't dramatized in attempts, making visions feel passive rather than earned through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from kintsugi philosophy and zodiac symbolism; final stars image ("fragments of a greater whole") reweights "weight of names" without moralizing, avoiding the thematic echo trap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("damp metal and herbs, a factually mystical blend") shines, but "luminous regret" recurs as unvaried label during peak stress, slightly dulling emotional specificity in the furnace beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with rhythmic control ("iron walls glistening," "symbols twisting"), but "luminous regret" repetition risks synonym churn; no artifacts dull closure despite minor scaffold in transition phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alchemy reimagined through kintsugi lens transforms tropes; emotional specificity in "redeeming intentions not objects" avoids abstraction, though zodiac coin risks familiarity without its name-weight integration.</comment>
