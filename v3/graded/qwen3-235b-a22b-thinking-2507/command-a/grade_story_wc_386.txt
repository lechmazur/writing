<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction lacking; "salvage something pure" stated without visceral conflict. Embodied emotion present (tremor in chest) yet flaws don't compound choices—Elara's flawless execution undercuts earned struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: globe clearing reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (time's distortion overcome). Accumulative lens holds through dream fragments, but cost legibility slightly soft—dawn's warmth dilutes emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glacier shrine constrains choice (requires stillness for ritual) and charges final image; "borrowed starlight" micro-setting embodies thematic tension. Sensory details (cracked glass, freezing tears) filter through Elara's ghost-whispering lens without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (giving voice to voiceless) signaled early, but pressure lacks tangible opposition—dreams yield smoothly without setbacks. One meaningful deepening (globe clearing) suffices for length, yet visible cost remains abstract versus felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (melted globe as time's distortion), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "warmth in cold places" non-literally, but thematic resonance slightly undercut by dawn's generic symbolism diluting conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer" lexicon) and rhythmic control shine in dream sequences. Minor register drift in "tapestry woven from fragments" cliché, but voice modulates effectively under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "crystalline walls humming with ancient energy." Slight overwriting ("world seemed to hold its breath") but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line's "warmth could be found" edges toward sentimentality without breaking momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-lore with wreck-diving avoids tropes; "melted snow globe" specificity transforms familiar objects. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, but emotional complexity lacks bold edges—Elara's flawless process feels unrealized.</comment>
