<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "methodically hopeful" trait shown through nightly ritual versus passive vision reception; micro-choices like ink selection reveal painter's specificity, but vision-induced transformation lacks sufficient struggle against exhaustion to fully earn the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: "saffron quiet" crystallizes reconfigured purpose with felt cost of exhaustion transforming into resolve; moon progression provides sufficient tightening, though brush's magic origin remains slightly unmoored from prior causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse micro-setting actively constrains choices—smog-to-clarity shift alters perception, and the moon-tipped brush (as tool) directly charges the final image; jasmine scent and canvas light evolution demonstrate causal environmental integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rousing lost language) tightens via moon's ascent and brush's intensifying warmth; Elara's shift from personal solace to communal purpose creates authentic tension between insomnia-driven ritual and sudden urgency, with exhaustion-to-purpose transformation as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through painterly action—brushstrokes as language revival—avoiding moralizing; final "saffron quiet" resonates as non-literal answer to "strangers remember kindness," reweighting prior struggle without abstraction or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waxing moon glow danced across canvas," "indigo shimmered like night sky") reflects painter's POV; rhythmic control modulates under pressure (vision sequence's fluid syntax vs. dawn's crisp clarity), with daydream device taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("brush seemed to hum... seemed to grow warmer") slightly dull momentum in high-pressure beats; otherwise strong density—e.g., "smog outside faded, replaced by clear sky" compresses transformation without scaffold—but not flawless for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic process and linguistic archaeology avoids magical realism clichés; "saffron quiet" as emotional specificity feels inevitable yet unexpected, with rooftop greenhouse anchoring universality in verifiable detail (grime-streaked glass, weathered stool).</comment>
