<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("soothed and tormented") and embodied emotion ("fingers trembling") strengthen motivation, but debt repayment remains abstract without visible trade-offs; betrayal backstory summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "beacon of resonant awakenings," but conceptual cost ("freedom and reckoning") lacks visceral legibility; Accumulative lens holds though escalation feels atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choice ("buried beneath roots"), with petrified blossoms and winter-cracked fields charging final image; sensory details filtered through spectral POV ("ashen-veil," "winter-cracked fields") actively shape the bead's discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) tightens through bead's awakening, but "mournful elation" lacks concrete cost escalation; spirits' chorus deepens stakes yet resolution remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of debt as collective burden emerges through "chain that bound them all," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "resonant awakenings" as both freedom and reckoning without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petrified blossoms," "flicker of light in endless night") modulates with spectral urgency; controlled rhythm shifts from languid description to staccato tension during bead's awakening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "her motivation was clear... her elation... was always tempered" creates paraphrase loop; otherwise vivid propulsion with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemical orchard with ghost lore transforms "debt across lifetimes" trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
