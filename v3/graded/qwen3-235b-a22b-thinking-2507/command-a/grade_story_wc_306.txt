<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract ("welcome nuance"); lacks contradictory impulses or visible cost in closure. "Sincerely insincere" is label-only diagnostic phrasing without embodied demonstration of Mara's struggle. Elias' flaw-free competence undermines stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost proof: no on-page sentence/image showing Mara's uncertainty's price. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost ambiguity weakens reconfiguration. Strong orientation anchors early but payoff remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid lighthouse atmosphere fails micro-setting test: wind/chimes don't constrain choices (e.g., no gust disrupting writing). Hollow mirror handled twice but final image lacks tactical charge—shard as passive reminder, not active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("cloak of doubt") declared but never tested in scene; no escalation or narrowing of options. Elias faces zero opposition—deciphering chimes requires no trade-off. Dominant stake lacks visceral pressure or visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through hollow mirror (brokenness→acceptance) without moralizing. Final image reweights "doubt" as growth space. But "sincerely insincere" is thematic echo, slightly muddying earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Elias' symbolic noticing) with rhythmic control. "Conscience for hire" jarringly corporate diction breaks voice modesty. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via wind-chime metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "turning it in his hands, and felt the weight" uses filter verbs. "Sincerely insincere" is label-speak in peak beat. Template cadence in chime description ("seemed random but felt deliberate") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "conscience for hire" with hollow mirror symbolism. Avoids sentimentality in doubt→growth arc. But "cloak of doubt" feels derivative; replacing lighthouse with cabin wouldn't alter logic, hurting specificity.</comment>
