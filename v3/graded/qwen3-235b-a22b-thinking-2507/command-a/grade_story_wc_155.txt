<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's embodied emotion ("tears streaming," "fingers brushing cold stone") and micro-choices (examining fragment, loading film) reveal authentic struggle, but "lost joy" motivation lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany feels earned yet slightly tidy without deeper internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—the fog-painting crystallizes her artistic rebirth with felt cost of years drained—but knowledge network’s late introduction weakens causal escalation; "fold of a daydream" teaches temporal fluidity effectively for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (canvas for light), but orchard ruins remain atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices; sensory details like "damp earth" and "frayed film edges" anchor urgency yet miss full 9+ gate for environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic joy) tightens through Lira’s active engagement with film, but pressure relies slightly on convenience (fog "guiding" her); cost of drained passion is legible yet not viscerally dramatized during peak escalation at the projector.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fog-painting’s synthesis of memory and art; final image reweights "lost joy" without moralizing, but "preserving moments for others to feel" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispering secrets," "luminescent pigments glowed faintly") modulates with emotional intensity; minor filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") in high-pressure beats slightly dilute immediacy without breaking voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves rhythmic control ("crumbling walls and twisted trees whispering secrets") with high density, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("faded but its story still vivid"/"stirred something within her") trigger minor momentum drag in early beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Painting with light" transforms the artist-ruins trope through specific mechanics, yet emotional arc leans familiar; "knowledge network" feels derivative despite fresh fog-canvas synthesis, missing bold risk-taking for 9+ band.</comment>
