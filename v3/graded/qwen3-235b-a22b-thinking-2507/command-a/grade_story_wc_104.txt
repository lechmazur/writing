<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (chains as burden/strength) drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion via "trembling hands" and "breath steady" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of chains earned by prior causality but lacks deeper flaw confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: chains falling as seeds are secured reconfigures freedom/resilience under causal lens. Wall collapse timing creates one tightening that forecloses escape routes; cost legible in "chains dragging like anchors" during climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Carnival setting constrains choices (labyrinthine layout for evasion) and charges final image (decay transformed to "launching point for hope"). Rusted Ferris wheel and piano bench details are purpose-driven, avoiding generic decay tropes while mirroring internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeds vs. wall collapse) tightens via protagonist's agency decoding piano keys; cost escalates through chains hindering ladder descent. One meaningful pressure point suffices, but pursuers' late arrival slightly softens opposition's causal weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (seeds as "lifelines," arrow as relic) without moralizing. Final image reweights "resilience" via burial of arrow with seeds, but "gesture of defiance against a dying world" edges toward abstract assertion, limiting Q5+ potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "chains rattled softly, a reminder of the burden" shows character-specific noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure ("dodging unseen blades") avoids uniformity; elision of backstory taught early via "years studying its secrets" pays off in decisive action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("pried open floorboards, revealing a ladder descending into darkness" compresses action). Minor overwriting in "dancer dodging unseen blades" slightly muddles peak-beat clarity without harming closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through specific constraints (chains as tactical hindrance) and emotional truth (freedom as "quiet triumph"). Fresh inflection in seeds as "lifelines" rather than salvation, though carnival setting risks familiarity without deeper world logic.</comment>
