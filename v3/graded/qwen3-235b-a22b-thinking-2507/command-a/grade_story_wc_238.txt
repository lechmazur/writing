<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses during apology; epiphany feels unearned without visible struggle against resistance. Emotional shift from regret to forgiveness occurs too smoothly without embodied cost beyond relief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis through orchard's "essence" remaining, with felt cost in "trees would soon be gone." Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to reconfigured final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("scent lingering on her skin"). Orchard's impending loss constrains emotional choices, with sensory details reflecting urgency through "hush" and "held breath" motifs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection before orchard loss) tightens via "hush before cutting" timeframe, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the bottle "guides her hand," making resolution feel passive rather than earned through choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of "imperfect miracles" emerges organically through bottle's cracks and orchard's roots, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("roots would remain") offers resonant answer without stating moral, though "ethereal grit" phrasing slightly tips toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "scents were spells" and "currents of memory"; rhythmic control shines in orchard sigh description. Minor register drift in "imperfect miracles" meta-phrase momentarily disrupts voice cohesion under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack ("felt the urgency," "felt the currents," "felt her grandmother’s presence") in high-pressure beat dulls immediacy. Otherwise strong propulsion, but metaphor density ("ghostly flower," "fragmented image") risks overwriting in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "gossip-column exorcist" premise with orchard-as-archive metaphor. Emotional specificity in "hands stained with soil" avoids templates, though "ethereal grit" concept lacks sufficient grounding in physical struggle.</comment>
