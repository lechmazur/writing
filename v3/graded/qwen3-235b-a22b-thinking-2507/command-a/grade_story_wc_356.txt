<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; ambition vs emptiness lacks simultaneous tension in climax. Epiphany feels earned but "tears welled" slightly generic for high-band cost embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost ("tears welled... true gift was the journey"), but cost proof lacks specificity—emotional price not anchored to persistent constraint like journal practice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Corpse flower constrains choices (ritual watering) and charges closure via scent-triggered wisdom. "Wildflower hush" evolves from atmosphere to thematic anchor in final line, charging the Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through scent-triggered wisdom, narrowing options to surrender ambition. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the tide’s timing feels coincidental rather than pressure-coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through corpse flower’s journey metaphor without moralizing. Final image ("wildflower hush a constant reminder") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "harmony of motion and rest" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via olfactory focus, but "tide of thought" abstraction dilutes POV modesty. Voice modulates well under pressure yet "whispered secret of the ancients" drifts into generic mysticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in opening ("calloused from years... moved with precision" repeats later). "Dappled sunlight"/"silvery glow" verge on cliché, but corpse flower’s scent description ("earthy aroma resonating deep within her chest") shows precise textural propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory herbalism with wisdom tropes, but "tide of thought" concept lacks transformative specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes yet stops short of inevitable hindsight per 9+ standard.</comment>
