<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; terminal diagnosis lacks embodied struggle despite high stakes. "Brazen calm" repeats as label without micro-choices revealing internal cost. Motivation clear but interiority remains rationalized, avoiding the messy irrationality of facing death.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of mortality, but six-month timeframe fails to tighten decisions or create meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Discoveries accumulate smoothly without pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Strong orientation anchors setting but pressure lacks escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Copper wire functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image (glinting arches). Sensory details like the wire's "hum" are selective and purposeful, though spatial choreography of pillars remains vague. Misses opportunity for environmental pressure beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Time pressure (six months) remains abstract without altering tactics or creating trade-offs; no deepening of knowledge narrows options meaningfully. Stakes are clear but escalation lacks coherent pressure under Accumulative lens—discoveries unfold linearly without complication. Cost of mortality is visible but not dramatized as narrowing Elias's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through orchard-as-community metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing. Final diary entry risks thematic echo but is salvaged by being in-character documentation. Lacks the resonant non-literal answer required for higher bands; closure leans toward stated moral despite strong particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable with botanical perceptual signature, but "brazen calm" becomes a tic that flattens voice under pressure. Prose modulates effectively during discoveries yet repetitive phrasing dulls peak beats. Strong focalization marred by uniform emotional calibration that avoids stress-induced distortion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Repetitive "brazen calm" phrasing in closure beat creates scaffold loops, reducing propulsion. Minor synonym churn ("gently systematic," "deliberate") and filter verbs ("he noticed how") accumulate. Clean grammar but closure image dulled by rhythmic monotony in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological legacy and architectural mystery avoids terminal illness clichés through botanical precision. Specific copper-wire technique elevates trope, though "unlocking ancient secrets" framework feels familiar. Emotional truth in quiet purpose-building compensates for modest structural risk.</comment>
