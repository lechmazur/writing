<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's "brightly attentive" trait drives discovery but lacks contradictory impulses; the lie to her supervisor lacks embodied tension, reducing earned stakes at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (void becoming actionable pursuit), but "mirror of the void" near-thematic echo slightly over-explains the final image's charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archive functions as micro-setting via deleted files' physical void, yet the patch/song lack tactile constraints on choices; strong sensory specificity but no object charges the final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through number pattern escalation, but Mara's recording resolves via luck (bypassed security), not protagonist agency; cost (career risk) is legible but not dramatized in final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" evolves from data gap to moral imperative, but final line ("truth would finally be heard") borders on thematic echo, slightly undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brightly attentive" shaping observation) shines, though "sensed absence" repetition feels forced; consistent voice under pressure with clean elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion until climax; "sensed absence" synonym churn (4x) and minor scaffold in final paragraph ("realized... made decision") deduct 0.3 without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archaeology tropes (social archive as cosmic clue); risk in quiet closure pays off, transforming derivative spaceship mystery through setting-specific causality.</comment>
