<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority rich but epiphany unmotivated; "mended deception" appears as diagnostic label without embodied cost during polishing ritual. Contradictory impulses absent—Elias merely reflects rather than struggles under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (accepting flaws as beautiful), but lens ambiguity past midpoint undermines escalation. "Luck as fortuities" introduced yet never pressures choices, violating Accumulative/Textural density requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Garden maze functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: twisting paths mirror Elias's realizations, and final marble placement charges closure. Tool (marbles) directly alters tactics through polishing ritual and rainbow effects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) remains abstract, never tested through action. Polishing ritual lacks escalation—it's repetitive with no narrowing of options. Conceptual cost (self-doubt) felt but not earned via agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through marbles/garden cracks but "mended deception" phrasing triggers thematic echo penalty. Final image reweights prior material, yet Q4's escalation failure caps Q5 per cross-cap rules despite resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (focus on textures: "gnarled hands," "faint glow") with rhythmic control. Minor flaw: "mended deception" violates interiority lexicon as diagnostic label, but compression remains purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding; only slight redundancy in "cracks not flaws but survival markers" near climax. No loops or register drift, though final paragraph's "paradoxical blend" edges toward overwriting without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of garden-as-self metaphor with mended marbles, avoiding sentimentality. "Fortuities" concept underutilized, but specificity (vine dresser's hands, maze paths) transforms familiar premise without safety-hedging.</comment>
