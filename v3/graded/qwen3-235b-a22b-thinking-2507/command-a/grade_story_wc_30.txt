<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elara's meticulous routine versus chaotic identity migration, but lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during peak pressure; epiphany feels earned yet slightly tidy without visceral struggle under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("After tomorrow disappeared, the world would continue to shift"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—problem resolves via single orb-dissolving action without causal pressure buildup under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal atrium’s breathing walls and bioluminescent runes actively constrain choices (dipping hand triggers whisper); bamboo creel functions as micro-setting charging final image ("creel now empty but ready").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilizing identities) signaled early, but escalation falters—rapid fluctuations solved via convenient orb-dissolving with no tangible cost during action; conceptual cost emerges only in reflection, failing band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "accepting contradictions" whisper and final image of transformed identities; avoids moralizing with resonant answer ("wonder could be found even in unsettling changes") reweighting prior chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("runes pulsed softly," "identities drifted like seaweed") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in reflective passage ("a river, ever-changing") slightly disrupts urgency during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but two paraphrase loops ("Her work was meticulous... driven by motivation," "truth was not singular but a tapestry") dull immediacy in mid-beat without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism tropes (moon-phase identities) via concrete details (titan-gear librarian, bamboo creel as identity-container); avoids derivative pitfalls but hedging on moral ambiguity slightly tempers risk.</comment>
