<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation "to capture possibility" earned through embodied choices (unsnap gauntlet, tracing vines), but transformation from withdrawn to storyteller lacks sufficient contradictory impulses during pressure peak; ink-seeping micro-choice strong yet "shivering bliss" slightly unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("armor less burden"), but reality-shifting pressure remains vague; cost legible in "shed when ready" yet escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice (gravel crunch, vine patterns) and charges final image ("vines wave him onward"); bioluminescent vines function as micro-setting that actively shapes tactics and closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes in internal conflict (withdrawal vs. engagement) deepen via program's vibration, but pressure coherence falters—reality shifts feel atmospheric rather than tightening tactics; conceptual cost felt yet insufficiently viscerally anchored per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of constrained possibility emerges organically from marionette imagery ("knots" to "free" figure), but "shivering bliss" edges toward sentimentality; final "weaver of possibility" resonates without moralizing yet slightly over-articulates the earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV perceptual signature shines ("vines pulsed with heartbeat"), rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure; near-slippage with "shivering bliss" therapy-speak avoided by contextual embodiment in prior tactile details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with zero closure-touched artifacts, but "shivering bliss" triggers minor therapy-speak penalty in peak beat; "factually mystical light" risks register drift yet saved by consistent alchemical lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight/marionette archetypes through specific greenhouse mechanics; risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, but "endless night" trope slightly dilutes originality despite strong transformation via ink-seeping motif.</comment>
