<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (caution vs. hunger) drives action; embodied emotions layer authentically during the mutiny climax; "spark of purpose" earns change without tidy resolution. No therapy-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: storm intensity and fragment hum escalate pressure coherently. Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost ("void... transformed") in final image. Orientation clear by 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("uneasy calm"); amulet fragment constrains choices (magnetic manipulation). Sensory details reflect urgency—crisis narrows perception to magnetic hum and flickering colors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist agency tightens pressure: Elyr’s magnetic experimentation narrows options toward mutiny. Cost is unmistakable ("dimensions colliding") and shapes final stance. Dominant stake (void vs. purpose) signaled by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "spark of purpose" reweights "endless cycle" without moralizing. Final image ("felt alive") offers resonant answer to "what happens after goodbye" via prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light fractured into infinite hues") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor syntactic monotony in descriptive passages, but compression taught early ("solar storm" intensifies prose density).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but overwriting in climax ("prismatic colors twisted into chaotic patterns"); slight metaphor muddle ("shadows deepened, as if the escondite itself was alive"). Final line ("that was enough") rescues momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of immortal trope via spatial mutiny mechanics; "prismatic escondite" specificity anchors universals. Avoids derivative pitfalls through concrete magnetic field method and earned emotional cost.</comment>
