<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; final realization about "mending truths" feels unearned without sufficient micro-choices under pressure. Emotions labeled ("trembling," "sorrow") rather than embodied, with minimal cost beyond spent magic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: rust receding and chip's dullness manifest conceptual cost. Causal-accumulative lens holds through tether discovery to climax, with the journey shard taught early and transitions legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Covenant’s rust-choked gears charge the climax image, but the journey section ("forests where trees sang") lacks specific environmental constraints on choices. Workshop resonance chamber remains decorative rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore stolen light) tightens meaningfully when tether discovery forces the journey. Agency in freeing—not repairing—the box narrows options, but the cost (spent stone) feels emotionally shallow for high-band elevation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through action: "mending what isn’t torn" crystallizes in the final image without moralizing. The rust’s transformation reweights decay as balance, avoiding abstraction while resonating beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears wilting near dishonesty") and rhythmic control shine, though "tinkersong wonder" slightly disrupts lexicon. Zero head-hopping; tension modulates via sentence compression during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean propulsion with vivid specificity ("chip shimmering like stolen dawn"), but "discordant echo" borders on cliché and "tinkersong wonder" feels forced. No loops or scaffold; final line’s "melody carried on wind" resonates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Covenant of Rust" ingeniously reframes decay as balance, with tether mechanics growing organically from setup. Lacks the hairline slip resilience for 9.0, but specific details (chip’s glow intensifying during unwinding) prevent derivativeness.</comment>
