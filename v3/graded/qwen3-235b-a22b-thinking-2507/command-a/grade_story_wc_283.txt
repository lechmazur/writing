<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation ("spin prophecy into raw possibility") is concrete and embodied through tactile interaction with buttons, avoiding stock phrasing. Contradictory impulses (trembling hands vs. deliberate grace) under pressure deepen interiority, though the epiphany about "potential for change" lacks sufficient struggle to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara stepping into changed air ("charged with quiet inspiration") crystallizes the conceptual cost of carrying wisdom, with the Accumulative lens holding through button-cataloging density. No causality breaks; the bone button’s discovery tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The jar and buttons function as micro-setting that charges the final image (pouch as keepsake), but the warehouse’s "amber" glow and "dust" remain atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Sensory details like the echo’s "low vibration" are selective yet lack the urgency-driven narrowing required for 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency—cataloging buttons tightens options until the bone button forces a stance crystallization. The felt cost (her altered perception of the air) is unmistakable, though the echo’s abstract "wisdom" slightly dilutes visceral stakes despite strong Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the echo’s chorus ("threshold between worlds"), with the final wind whisper offering a non-literal answer to "unearthing truths." Avoids moralizing, but "prophecy into possibility" edges toward thematic echo, preventing 9.0 despite earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("fingers brushing shelves," "bone button etched with symbols"), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt a surge") are minimal and voice-motivated, meeting 9+ criteria despite one borderline abstract phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Two paraphrase loops ("quietly inspired, her focus unbroken" followed by "time felt fluid") slightly dull momentum, but no artifacts in the closure beat. High density and concrete propulsion elevate it, though synonym churn ("unscramble," "unravels") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy tropes through the button-cataloging method, with "canyon as threshold" offering fresh inflection. Emotional specificity in Elara’s quiet resolve avoids generic templates, though "hourglass turner" lacks sufficient novelty for 9.5+.</comment>
