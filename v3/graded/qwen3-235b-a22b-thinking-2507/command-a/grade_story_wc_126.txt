<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (itching to play vs. held back by hush) drives micro-choices like tracing bowl symbols. Embodied emotion in "strange warmth" and "weight of memories" avoids labels. Final "renewed purpose" lacks visible cost, capping just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: hush transforms from void to "muse" with felt cost ("silence... expectant"). Accumulative escalation through violin notes awakening shipwrecks/greenhouse holds lens consistently. Cost legible but not visceral enough for 8.9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse constrains choice (must play within its fractured glass) and charges final image ("imperfection that true beauty lay"). Shipwrecks "listening" evolves setting causally. Minor redundancy in "charred remnants/ashen soil" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (filling hush) tightens via violin playing, narrowing options to storytelling. Agency-driven escalation but cost remains conceptual ("weight of memories") without tangible forfeiture. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: violin scars, greenhouse "serene defiance." Final image reweights "unfinished" as beautiful without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—insight earned via bowl's warmth and land's "exhale."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "whispers of wind," "hum of insects" filtered through acoustics. Rhythm modulates from hesitant notes to swelling tapestry. "Chronic hush" repetition risks loop but serves motif coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"shipwrecks creaked... wooden bones groaning" does triple duty. Minor slips: "weathered and scarred" (redundant after "calloused"), "dormant world" (abstraction). No closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Echo-harbor violinist" transforms trope via acoustics-driven action. Silence as active canvas (not absence) feels fresh. "Beauty in ashes" slightly familiar but specificity ("mendicant’s bowl as brush") elevates synthesis.</comment>
