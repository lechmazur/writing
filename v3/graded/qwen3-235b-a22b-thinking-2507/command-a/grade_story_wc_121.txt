<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("boots gripping slick surface") and micro-choices under pressure, but secondary pressure is absent without on-page characters. Flaws complicate choices credibly, though the abrupt resolution lacks visible cost escalation in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Earned Stasis closure; the tablet’s fading glow and Elara’s relief ("feeling lighter") provide visible cost. Orientation test passed via rain-soaked viaduct anchoring by line 5, but procedural generation mechanics remain vague, weakening middle escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Wet asphalt scent and viaduct’s luminescence create vivid atmosphere, but setting functions decoratively rather than constraining choices (e.g., rain doesn’t impede movement). The clay tablet charges the final image yet lacks mid-scene causal pressure, missing 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquering self-labyrinth) tightens via timeline visions, with the tablet’s dimming serving as felt cost. Escalation lacks agency-driven narrowing of options—visions accumulate passively—failing the band guardrail for visible price charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the viaduct’s "drop and ripple" metaphor reweighted at closure; the final line ("ripple was hers to shape") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction, earning 9-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("world felt suspended—trapped between the drop and ripple") and rhythmic control shine, but filter verbs ("she felt the weight") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves textural specificity ("ribbon of light," "hollow eyes") with strong propulsion, but minor synonym loops ("pulsed with urgency"/"urgency she couldn’t ignore") and abstract phrasing ("darkening brightness") trigger small deductions. No fatal artifacts, though figurative density risks muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "fractured timelines as self-labyrinth" avoids trope clichés through concrete emotional stakes (painter/despoiler selves). Bold structural risk in accumulative design heightens coherence, though "gravity defier" premise lacks transformative specificity to reach 9.0.</comment>
