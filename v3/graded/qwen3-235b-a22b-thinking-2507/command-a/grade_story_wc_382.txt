<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara’s embodied hesitation with the seal and contradictory impulse to engage Elias despite distrust creates authentic interiority; Elias remains undermotivated as a symbolic device rather than character with flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Clara’s door-knock crystallizes stakes with felt cost of vulnerability; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup but meteor shower framing lacks causal integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rooftop garden’s sensory details (herb scents, brick chimney) constrain choice via Clara’s architectural sensitivity; antique seal charges final image but sugar pouch lacks micro-setting evolution to reach 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from curiosity to societal-cost awareness via Elias’ "agreed-upon lies" revelation; pressure tightens once at meteor peak but secondary conflict (seal’s purpose) lacks escalation beyond thematic exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of knocking reweights "borrowing sugar" as active resistance to silencing pasts without moralizing; "language of buildings" concept crystallizes into earned ambiguity about whose voices get heard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>POV voice distills Clara’s architectural attunement into selective perception ("floorboards creaked as if sharing secrets"); Elias’ dialogue lacks distinct idiom, converging with Clara’s reflective tone under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose avoids scaffold except minor meteor shower description; "cosmos" and "whispered secrets" metaphors risk cliché but gain specificity through Clara’s tactile seal-gripping under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architectural animism with societal critique feels inevitable; risks poetic abstraction but anchors universals in Clara’s sugar-pouch ritual, avoiding derivative "wise stranger" tropes.</comment>
