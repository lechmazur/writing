<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("diplomatically fierce" vs. precision pursuit) drives micro-choices like the mechanical arm's deliberate arc during the pivotal "test your theory" challenge. Final renunciation of destination-seeking earns closure through embodied cost in the "chaos became dignified" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves" reconfigures the sundial's meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens. The brook's shift from "counterpoint" to "music" crystallizes the felt cost of the epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mechanical arm constrains choice during the sundial tracing beat and charges the final image ("glinted as he gestured" → "relaxing at his side"). Rainbows fracturing across stone floor mirror the thematic splintering of certainty, avoiding overt symbolism through action-integrated perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: his "test your theory" reversal forces Mara's hesitation, narrowing options to conceptual surrender. The cost—relinquishing destination-seeking—is legible in the brook's transformed murmur becoming "music" during the final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the needle card's shimmer during Elias's process argument, avoiding moralizing. The final line ("duel became a dance") reweights "dignified chaos" into earned resonance without stating a thesis, sidestepping thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV filters sensory details through Elias's philosophical lens ("angles as interpretations, not truths"), with distinct idiom in Mara's "sharp as a needle" retorts. Compression in the brook's evolving role ("counterpoint" → "only sound" → "music") modulates tension effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sunlight weaving through the chaos" recharges the opening "dignified chaos" with conceptual weight. Figurative language ("prismatic light," "labyrinth of uncertainty") avoids muddle by anchoring to concrete objects like the sundial's angles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms duel tropes through word-fencing mechanics where the sundial's geometry replaces swords. The "hidden overture = us" resolution grows organically from the needle card's shimmer during Elias's process argument, avoiding derivative epiphanies.</comment>
