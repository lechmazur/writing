<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; priest's flawless execution avoids genuine struggle. Diagnostic label-speak in climax ("unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity") triggers penalty without dramatized cost. Motivation clear but untested by internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis through rhetorical accumulation, but cost remains abstract despite dimensional restoration. No visible sacrifice or enduring consequence weakens final beat under Accumulative lens. Orientation strong, yet cost proof test fails per Q2 requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly rendered ("muffled clarity," resonant silence) but setting doesn't constrain choices. Dimensional anchor functions as lyrical backdrop without altering tactics. Misses 9+ gate: environment fails to charge final image or pressure decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early with meaningful deepening via rhetorical escalation. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens through increasingly pointed questions. Visible cost legibility weakens band entry; no tangible forfeiture alters protagonist's state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rhetorical devices and void symbolism. Final declaration risks thematic echo but avoids overt moralizing through action integration. Subtext strongest in silence-as-presence motif; final line slightly overstates conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory rendering of silence ("resonant, a canvas"). Rhythmic control excels during questioning sequences. Minor register drift in climax ("unraveled stillness") slightly disrupts voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; "muffled clarity" exemplifies textural precision. Template cadence in rhetorical questions ("What is unseen..."/"Why do we fear...") causes minor momentum drag. Zero closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-timekeeping and void-as-tool elevates tropes. "Loop pedal priest" transforms archetypes through specific mechanics. Emotional truth in questioning assumptions avoids abstraction; avoids safety middle with bold conceptual framing.</comment>
