<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("cultivate sparks") is clear but under-dramatized; no contradictory impulses tested under pressure. "Dreamless" trait stated but unused in choices; closure lacks earned cost beyond abstract hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (archive reigniting) lacks visible/felt cost; clock’s revival feels convenient. Lens is Hybrid (causal/accumulative) but cost proof fails—Mara’s "surge of hope" is unearned without sacrifice, violating Q2 cost test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glowing dune functions as micro-setting: sand guides path, responds to charm, and charges final image. "Luminescent sand" constraint shapes every action—entry, navigation, and exit—fulfilling Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving archive) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Charm use succeeds instantly; no meaningful tightening or cost until closure, where "divergence" revelation feels unearned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing hope emerges through embers/sparks, but ending lacks conceptual cost. "Protect their divergence" is stated, not dramatized; final image reweights stakes without showing price paid, limiting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand shifting," "dune whispered") sustains voice under pressure. Minor register drift in "wave functions" terminology, but rhythmic control in vortex sequence elevates tension without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat, but "Mara felt... Mara realized..." template cadence in mid-scene dulls immediacy. High density otherwise; final line’s "charm warm... clock ticking" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Divergent archive" transforms apocalypse tropes through specific logic (sparks → futures), but "dreamless" trait lacks fresh inflection. Risk-taking in hybrid structure pays off, though safety-hedging in untested charm power limits boldness.</comment>
