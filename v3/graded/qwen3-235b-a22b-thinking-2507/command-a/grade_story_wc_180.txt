<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradiction—quartz eyes mending others while carrying her own cracks—drives micro-choices (ribbon handling, tool use). Final shift to hope earns through causal pressure of the orchard’s metaphor, though Lyra’s off-page presence limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (ribbon woven into glowing tree symbolizing resilience) lands with felt cost: her reinterpretation of breach as "necessary shedding" crystallizes stance with emotional weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but scroll discovery edges toward convenient causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ribbon-as-micro-setting constrains choices (compass pointing to it) and charges closure; orchard soil actively enables petal magic. Sensory hierarchy—fruit scent thickening air, rustling secrets—filters through Elara’s mender lens without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (bridging generational wisdom via vows) tighten when she reinterprets breach as "necessary shedding," narrowing options to renewal. Cost (regret transforming to hope) is legible but lacks visceral weight; escalation leans slightly passive via environmental response rather than protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: deciduous vow concept reweights via orchard’s seasonal logic, culminating in non-literal answer ("mending isn’t restoring but creating"). Zero moralizing; final glow lingers with conceptual cost of brokenness holding beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz in irises catching light," "branches rustling with secrets") modulates with pressure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she wondered," "she realized") in high-stakes moments dull immediacy without breaking voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose prose ("roots entwined with ancient stones" implying struggle), but paraphrase loops ("reclaiming of forgotten spaces"/"nature’s reclaiming") and borderline thematic echo in final paragraph ("even in brokenness, beauty") cap score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes "broken vow" trope with fresh specificity: quartz-eye mender, deciduous vows as seasonal renewal, ribbon woven into living tree. Emotional truth in maternal regret avoids cliché, though cathedral-orchard setting borders on familiar.</comment>
