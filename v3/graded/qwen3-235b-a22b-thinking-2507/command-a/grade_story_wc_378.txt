<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s "fragmented wholeness" during miniaturization, but "inner static" edges toward diagnostic label-speak; memory loss cost lands with embodied specificity as petals "glistened" post-victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words (no "when" anchor until magnetic shift) triggers -0.4 penalty; closure as Earned Stasis holds with visceral memory loss cost, though lens ambiguity (Causal/Accumulative) caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Desert roses charge the final image ("glistening under the glass dome") and constrain choice via miniaturization focus, but magnetic shift lacks tactile integration beyond atmosphere; micro-setting succeeds through organic light and petal textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as fears "writhing" force miniaturization, with memory loss as undeniable cost; magnetic shift functions atmospherically but doesn’t concretely pressure tactics, missing full escalation potential under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through miniaturization metaphor reweighting childhood fears; "controlled burn escape" crystallizes in final peace without moralizing, though "fragmented wholeness" slightly overstates the conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "circuit hummed with dissonance" and "strangely organic light" modulates under pressure; minor abstraction ("fragmented wholeness") dilutes POV modesty but never breaks focalization consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "smooth yet etched with faint lines mimicking human age" slightly dilutes momentum; zero loops in climax, but "static that whispered" risks metaphor muddle without harming closure’s elegant propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "miniaturizing fears" transforms trope through desert rose resilience; emotional specificity in memory loss avoids abstraction, though magnetic shift premise leans familiar without deeper transformation.</comment>
