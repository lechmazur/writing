<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in faith restoration journey, but mural revelation lacks sufficient struggle; embodied emotion strong except for abstract "faith shattered" summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with mural realization, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; Accumulative lens holds through cyclical time motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard roots actively constrain choices (guiding toward tomb), with sundial base charging final image; sensory details perfectly filtered through excavator's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through purposeful wandering method, but pressure lacks tangible friction; orchard's assistance reduces earned cost despite cyclical time motif intensifying meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sundial/mural recurrence, but "interrupted journeys" concept lacks concrete trade-offs; avoids moralizing yet needs sharper cost in final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots snaked like veins") persists under pressure; rhythmic control falters slightly in reflection blocks but teaches lyrical pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt heavy," "realized this was it") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; otherwise exceptional density with no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard transforms diaspora trope through bone-root symbiosis; "faith restoration" premise remains slightly generic despite fresh sensory execution.</comment>
