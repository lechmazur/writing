<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority shines in quiet moments ("grips the swan tighter"), but her pivotal decision to journey lacks contradictory impulses—no hesitation about abandoning her duty despite the library’s "heavier" strain, undermining motivation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: Lira’s journals fill with unremembered entries, erasing the refuge yet embedding its silence in her work. But escalation falters—the catacombs "shifting as if guiding her" feels coincidental, not pressure-driven under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The origami swan evolves from inert companion to map-bearing catalyst, charging the final image ("swan folded neatly in her hands") with the cost of erased refuge. Sensory details like "damp earth and forgotten memories" anchor urgency without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("fragile balance she sought to preserve") deepen meaningfully when the swan trembles, but the journey lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Lira follows the map passively, with no trade-off (e.g., risking her journals) to narrow options or heighten cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "crumbling peace" shifts from burden to sacred duty in the final line ("became the silence she sought to preserve"). No moralizing; the swan’s rebirth in her hands reweights impermanence as active preservation, not passive acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("vines crawled up shelves... to silence their whispers"), filtering decay through Lira’s archival lens. But "grips reality loosely" is label-only, not embodied—voice wavers when abstract concepts intrude on tactile immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose sings with texture ("regenerative silence that soothed troubled minds"), but "grips reality loosely" is redundant scaffolding. Minor synonym churn ("crumbling peace," "fragile balance") in high-pressure beats dulls immediacy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "library keeper" trope through visceral specificity (origami swan as memory vessel), but "obsidian refuge" leans on familiar renewal motifs. Risk in abstract closure pays off, yet river/silence imagery echoes common archetypes without fresh inflection.</comment>
