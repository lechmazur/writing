<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through whittling vs blank face, but "moral ambiguity" remains label-only without visible tradeoffs; brother's backstory lacks present-moment micro-choice anchoring per BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (isolation as resistance), but orientation test waiver is narrow—turbines/farmhouse anchoring by para 2 barely clears the 120-word threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: whittled heart charges closure image while constraining choice (wood as sole emotional outlet); turbine shadows actively pressure her window gesture with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Accumulative lens as whittling deepens resolve, but "quiet rebellion" lacks visible escalation—pressure remains static rather than narrowing options under mandate's weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through whittled heart's transformation (wood→symbol), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "lightness in grief" as resonant answer to central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in turbine/farmhouse descriptions, but repetitive "blank face" phrasing and filter verbs ("she thought") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until final paragraph where "pulsed faintly"/"unyielding" cadence shift slightly overwrites; minor paraphrase loop ("emotional void she inhabited... void she had mastered") triggers -0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of domestic grief within dystopia via wind turbines' dual symbolism; risk-taking in quiet closure earns +0.3, but mandate premise edges close to recognizable templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>
