<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (linear vs. tangential pursuit) but "texture of time" motivation lacks embodied cost demonstration; Kael's off-page presence weakens relationship crucible despite thematic resonance in dialogue recall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("metamorphosis as inevitable as cicada’s emergence"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as time fragments layer toward reconfiguration of her entire approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Jade cicada functions as micro-setting charging closure, but grotto/stars remain atmospheric without constraining choices; "moss-covered stone" detail lacks tactical consequence despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validating tangential method) tightens through cicada's transformation, but "pause in conversation" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure; cost is conceptual yet unmistakable in metamorphosis realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through cicada's shifting carvings and time-layering; avoids moralizing but "texture of time" phrasing borders on abstraction without sufficient concrete grounding in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "warmly observant" details (carvings as "stories of transitions"), but "felt the texture of time" slips into abstract telling; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion, but "seemed to hum" and "felt a shift" filter verbs dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; no loops or scaffold near closure preserves integrity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chronicle-as-tapestry avoids template pitfalls, though "tidal-pool chronicler" occupational detail lacks transformative specificity; cicada's metamorphosis metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
