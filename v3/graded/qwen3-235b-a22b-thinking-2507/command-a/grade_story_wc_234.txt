<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong interiority in ritual execution but "scientifically romantic" trait remains label-heavy; emotional progression avoids tidiness yet diagnostic phrasing ("pursuit of understanding") triggers Q1 anti-pattern penalty. Final choice earns closure via embodied micro-choices like shell-touching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost ("something had changed"). Late lens naming ("by returning differently" at 75%) nearly triggers ambiguity cap but payoff justifies cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid twilight anchoring satisfies orientation, but ember nexus functions as backdrop not constraint. Nautilus shell serves as micro-setting with closure charge ("spiral of endless possibility"), yet fails 9+ gate by not actively narrowing choices during ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence) tightens through ritual's sensory escalation; protagonist agency drives the glow-touch transformation. Cost legible in irreversible perceptual shift ("air felt richer"), though passive object behavior ("shell began to glow") slightly dilutes causal pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell's evolving symbolism ("fragment of forgotten star" to "spiral of endless possibility") without moralizing. Final image reweights "density of presence" conceptually, though "scientifically romantic" jargon risks thematic echo. No closure-adjacent moralizing saves Q5 from penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's scientific-poetic lens) with rhythmic control in ritual sequence. Dialogue subtext ("secret whispered") reveals trust dynamics, but "palette of resolve" jargon creates minor register drift. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "calloused yet delicate" redundancy and "scientifically romantic" label approach overwriting thresholds. Final line ("twilight wrapping... like a promise") avoids closure artifacts, but mid-scene jargon slightly dulls momentum in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/time concepts through nautilus spiral mechanics, avoiding clichés with "ember nexus" specificity. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though "pocket-sun alchemist" borders on trendy jargon. Transformation test passed: swap "columella curl" with generic shell breaks ritual logic.</comment>
