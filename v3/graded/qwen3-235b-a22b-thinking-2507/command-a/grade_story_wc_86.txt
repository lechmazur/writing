<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction ("apology and forgiveness") manifests in tactile micro-choices (turning drawer pull) and embodied conflict ("cold air biting lungs"). Kael's silent nod reveals earned endurance with visible cost. Slight interiority gaps in high-pressure beats prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: drawer pull exchange crystallizes reconfigured options with conceptual cost ("forgiveness is a path walked"). Orientation penalty: mist/parapet setting anchored at ~150 words (past 120-word threshold), applying -0.3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Orientation penalty from Q2 caps score. Sensory details ("mist that clung like forgotten secrets") are vivid but static; parapet never constrains choices or charges closure. Micro-setting failure: storm affects atmosphere but not tactics, missing 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: "untether" evolves from metaphor to physical action (drawer pull exchange). Cost legible in Kael's "I do not forgive lightly" concession. Escalation driven by Elara's agency but moon phase method lacks causal pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through drawer pull's transformation: "broken things hold value" becomes embodied wisdom in final exchange. No moralizing; "path walked" reweights apology/forgiveness as shared journey. Final image delivers non-literal answer to central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("furrowed hush", "lantern’s light catch its etchings") modulates with storm intensity. Filter-verb stacks ("she had learned", "she knew") dilute immediacy in reflection beats, preventing higher score. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "Her method was unconventional..." tells rather than shows moon phase system. Template cadence in paragraph 3 ("She took...", "She began...") triggers -0.4. No closure artifacts, but filter-verb clusters in high-pressure beats prevent 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms negotiation tropes through specific details (drawer pull history, moon symbolism). Bold risk in quiet closure pays off, but "storm-worn parapet" cliché prevents 9.0. Emotional truth in Kael’s strained concession elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
