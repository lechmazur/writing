<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's "wistfully pragmatic" interiority feels authentic through concrete gardening actions and the tooth's tactile significance, but her pivotal connection with the lockmaster lacks contradictory impulses beyond surface resonance, reducing earned complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (shared vulnerability), yet lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural pressure from "quivering hush" motifs lacks causal escalation, weakening the "meaningful tightening" requirement for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The harbor’s moonlight and fire escape setting constrain choices (Elara’s descent), while the lockmaster’s tooth functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image; however, environmental pressure on tactics remains underdeveloped beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("searching for something lost") stay abstract without escalation—no narrowing of options or visible price paid beyond emotional revelation, violating the "meaningful tightening" mandate; coincidence (lockmaster’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t deepen the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme of illuminating shadows emerges organically through the tooth/harbor imagery, avoiding direct moralizing; yet the lockmaster’s "instilling life" line risks thematic echo, nearly triggering Q5 penalty for near-prompt language in pivotal dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara’s soil-and-petal observations, with rhythmic control during oar cadence; minor register drift occurs when "wistfully pragmatic" labels intrude mid-scene without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose excels in texture ("waters reflecting soft glow of lanterns"), but adjacent synonym loops ("quivering hush" x3) and filter verbs ("she noticed," "she felt") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy, narrowly avoiding artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardening/lockmaking metaphors elevates tropes, yet the "kindred spirit" resolution lacks bold risk—emotional safety hedging avoids confronting Elara’s flaws, limiting transformative ingenuity despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
