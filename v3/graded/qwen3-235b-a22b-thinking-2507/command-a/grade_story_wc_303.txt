<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via coffee-stain desperation vs. provenance rigor; "mulberry ache" embodies stress uniquely. Final choice earned by plant whispers and stains, but occupational detail (provenance research) remains ornamental rather than shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: violin's song mends perforations with felt cost ("mulberry ache," opaque violin). Causal lens holds—scouts' presence forces balcony action—but orientation debt (midsummer timing vague) prevents higher score despite strong cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Velvet observatory functions as micro-setting: brass telescopes and balcony constrain climax, while ice violin's physicality charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("steam curling like ghosts") avoids cliché, but midsummer sun lacks causal pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (violin's power vs. Dominion) tightens through coffee-stain vision and scouts' approach. Agency crystallizes in balcony choice with visible cost (sacrificed potential), though "empire vs. dream" moral calculus stays abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fractured harmony emerges through concrete actions (violin mending air perforations), not moralizing. Final image—"before the promise loses its glow"—reweights destiny without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mind alight with questions, though not all her own") modulates under stress. Lyric compression ("steam curling like ghosts") taught early and paid off in closure, with zero head-hopping despite telepathic plant voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in climax ("vines snaked... scouts froze"), but scaffold weakens momentum: "her mind alight with questions" redundantly echoes prior plant telepathy. No figurative muddle in peak beats preserves propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice violin and plant telepathy avoids trope recycling; "mulberry ache" transforms emotional cliché. Risk-taking (coffee-stain divination) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though Dominion remains underdeveloped as opposition.</comment>
