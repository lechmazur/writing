<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses in pressure; "eloquently silent" trait stated without tradeoffs during pivotal bridge encounter; final endurance earned yet cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with conceptual cost ("truth was painful, but it was hers to bear"); Accumulative lens consistent throughout; minor deduction for no persistent constraint shaping tactics during standing wave sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gramophone crank handle functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (turning mechanism) and charges final image; "golden shadows" evolves from literal to thematic weight; environment fully integrated with character priorities ("aged paper and forgotten dreams").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through density increase in standing wave sequence; conceptual cost unmistakable but lacks visible price altering tactics (e.g., no physical toll from transition); agency fully protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("keeper of hidden truth") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question; theme emerges through standing wave motif without moralizing; "bridge of intuition" reweights legacy as burden rather than revival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sepia," "standing waves") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor deduction for no lexicon distinction during peak stress (bridge encounter); zero head-hopping in seamless single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "first yawn of evening" opener anchors voice; final line ("walls holding her story") recharges motif; hairline slip in "eloquently silent" slightly generic phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms family-secret trope through sound physics metaphor; specific details (grandfather's journals, bridge transition) prevent generality; risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off but lacks revolutionary insight.</comment>
