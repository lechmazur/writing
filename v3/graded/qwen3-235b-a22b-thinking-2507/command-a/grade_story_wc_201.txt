<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her clinging to/releasing the mask strap, embodying the tension between trauma and resilience. Epiphany slightly over-articulated ("Mercy, she realized...") risks therapy-speak but avoids full diagnostic labeling. Final renunciation earned through embodied micro-choices like brushing the glowing leaf.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing under Accumulative/Textural lens: mask strap sinking crystallizes mercy as "truth to embrace" with visible cost (release of physical anchor). Orientation clear by 80 words; forest’s responsive light tightens pressure toward the earned stasis of her rootedness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest actively constrains choice—proprioception guides steps, roots mirror neural connections—and charges the final image as sanctuary/penance. Recurring mask strap’s physicality (glinting, sinking) avoids symbolic convenience by altering her stance from displacement to rootedness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mathematics of mercy) tightens through her deepening realization, narrowing options from formula-seeking to accepting purpose in pain. Cost is visceral in the mask strap’s release—a live option foreclosed with emotional weight—driven solely by her agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "mathematics of mercy" transforms from abstraction to embodied truth via the forest’s light-shadow balance. Final image ("light in darkest places") reweights trauma without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars like the sinking strap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in proprioceptive phrasing ("bark warm and pulsing," "forest’s roots beneath her feet") modulates with emotional intensity. Slight register drift in epiphany ("understanding its purpose") but rhythmic control sustains under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "forest seemed to breathe" followed by "forest seemed to respond" dulls momentum in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise clean propulsion—glowing leaf touch delivers clarity without scaffolding—but the redundancy prevents 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery with mathematical metaphor avoids tropes through ultraviolet penance’s physicality. Bold risk in making the forest an active mirror elevates stakes, but "mathematics of mercy" phrasing edges toward abstraction without sufficient grounding in prior particulars.</comment>
