<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("fingers traced rough bark," "hands trembling despite resolve") but face-blindness remains observational rather than driving concrete trade-offs; micro-choices under pressure lack contradictory impulses during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with felt cost ("world seemed different" post-collapse), but lens ambiguity early (Accumulative/Textural not solidified until coin mechanism) triggers minor lens drift penalty at midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree trunk library actively constrains choice (hollow access, collapsing walls altering tactics) and charges final image; oak's bark texture directly enables her tactile deciphering, satisfying micro-setting gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing infinity) lacks meaningful friction—success feels unearned as pressure (building collapse) coincidentally complicates but doesn't transform her approach; no live option foreclosed before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment>Final "beauty in endings" line veers into thematic echo (-0.6), undermining otherwise earned resonance; conceptual repricing through book-safe imagery would have sufficed without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractally precise detail" filtering world) shines under pressure; rhythmic control varies sentence length with her focus shifts, though "condemned building" repetition slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("fractally precise detail" x2) in high-pressure beat; otherwise impeccable propulsion, but "beauty in endings" overwriting dulls closure's conceptual charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Face-blind artist + book-safe fusion feels fresh, yet "mirror the sky" premise lacks transformation beyond familiar artistic struggle; specificity anchors universals but safety-hedging in stakes limits boldness.</comment>
