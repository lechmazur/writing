<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "profound connection" feels unearned without prior struggle. Micro-choices absent—Elara reacts passively to fossil revelations. Diagnostic label "factually mystical" triggers -0.5 deduction. Final purpose lacks visible cost beyond fatigue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but fails cost proof test—no exact sentence shows legible cost at ending beat. Orientation clear early; Accumulative lens holds. Non-closure accumulation: minor causality gaps (unexplained fossil levitation) apply -0.8.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid but setting never constrains choices—bioluminescent chamber revealed by fossil, not environment. Fails 9+ gate (no micro-setting charging closure). Salt/damp earth scent grounds early scenes but fades under pressure. Final image lacks environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when fossil floats toward chamber, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara follows passively with no trade-offs. Cost implied (exhaustion) but not tied to fossil/chamber choice. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet: price doesn't charge final "promise for future" image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory mapping motif but final paragraph states thesis explicitly: "testament to enduring power of human emotion." Thematic Echo in closing lines triggers -0.7 penalty. "Voice of the unknown" repetition feels prompt-derived rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("tracing contours," "hum faintly") but tense shifts inconsistently (past to present). "Factally mystical" is unmotivated academic diction disrupting voice. No dialogue, so those bullets irrelevant. Rhythmic control frays during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor syntactic loops ("her work," "she began") but no scaffold. "Factually mystical" is therapy-speak label; final cliché "journey... only just begun" weakens propulsion. Figurative language sparse but clean. Register drift in peak beats prevents 8.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sensory map maker" trope lacks transformation—replace with "historian" and arc unchanged. Fossil floating feels derivative; "transitional object" concept is academic jargon. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.7) for insufficient lived detail despite atmospheric strengths.</comment>
