<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("fingers hovering above keys," "bolt heavy with knowledge"), but the bolt's transformative epiphany lacks sufficient contradictory buildup; "frostbitten hope" borders on unearned sentimentality in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("silence transformed," bolt "heavy with knowledge"), but the staircase stain discovery feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legibility slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (ritual seating) and charging the final image ("bolt now in his pocket"); cobalt fortress snow creates tactile pressure through "frostbitten" sensory specificity that mirrors internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("cost of safety") tighten via the bolt discovery, but the shift from silence-as-prison to silence-as-truth feels abrupt; Elias' agency in playing the piano earns the climax, yet the conceptual cost lacks visceral embodiment beyond "heavy with knowledge."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "unpardonable silence" evolves from atmospheric detail to conceptual repricing via the bolt's transformation; final melody offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("seraphically mundane presence," "cobalt light") and rhythmic control shine, but "frostbitten hope" momentarily fractures voice with elevated diction inconsistent with Elias' restrained POV during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("whispers of those who had come before, of those who had tried") with clear propulsion, but "frostbitten hope" triggers minor overwriting in the climax beat, slightly muddling emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Silent-choir bellhop" and bolt concept synthesize tropes into fresh emotional truth; specificity ("rusty bolt," "nerve regeneration") avoids genericness, though the "fear beneath tranquility" premise risks familiarity without the bolt's ingenious micro-setting role.</comment>
