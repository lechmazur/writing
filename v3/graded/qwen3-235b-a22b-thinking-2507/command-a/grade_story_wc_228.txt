<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "intimately aloof" remains label without embodied contradiction; promise motivation clear yet epiphany lacks irrational struggle—final choice feels earned but cost ("lighter heart") lacks specific tradeoff. Micro-choice with seashell cradling shows value hierarchy but insufficient flaw-driven mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: final image of displayed painting crystallizes reconfigured stakes (isolation vs. connection) with felt cost in earlier aloofness. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, but cost legibility falters—"lighter heart" lacks concrete on-page price for the "temporary eternity" shift. Orientation anchors within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cave network actively constrains choices (boulder detour, pool reflection) and charges final image—the painting's display on the quay reweights the inverted-world motif. Micro-setting (stalactites/pool) directly shapes her painting decision, avoiding static description. Sensory hierarchy perfectly filters urgency through painter's eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (timeless creation vs. isolation) deepens via detour, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the boulder is coincidence, not choice. Cost ("lighter heart") is felt yet abstract; no visible price altering tactics like seashell's "impermanence" lesson. Band guardrail unmet: tightening forecloses isolation path but price doesn't charge final image concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the painting's display: "eternity as fleeting moment" reweights the oasis discovery without moralizing. Final image (strangers pausing at quay) answers the central question via charged particulars, avoiding thematic echo. Complexity embraces impermanence without false equivalence—no tidy resolution, only earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waves whispered secrets," "iridescent surface") modulates rhythm with emotional intensity. But "intimately aloof" and "essence of her journey" drift into abstraction under pressure, weakening voice specificity. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's quiet cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("fleeting dance" then "fleeting existence") and slight overwriting ("testament to meticulous craftsmanship") dilute density. Final paragraph summarizes where scene needed, but no closure-touching artifacts. Rhythm varies effectively—opening cadence mirrors wave patterns, tightening during painting climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's block" trope through specific cave imagery and "temporary eternity" framing. Emotional truth in aloofness-to-connection arc avoids generic templates, though "mirror cracked" metaphor feels familiar. Fresh inflection: painting as portal reconfigures time, but proximity check notes faint echoes of common epiphany structures.</comment>
