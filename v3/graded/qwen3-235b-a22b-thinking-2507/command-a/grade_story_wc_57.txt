<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction absent; patience is stated not tested through tradeoffs. No secondary character to crystallize stakes. "Infinitely patient" trait lacks embodied cost during decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: "ancient methods are safe" declares victory without consequence. Charged Poise fails as fog’s approval is atmospheric, not earned through narrowing options. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof test fails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity (crystalline snow, rope fibers) anchors early. Dock/snow/fog create immersive atmosphere but don’t constrain choices—brushing snow is incidental, not tactical. Micro-setting (fulgurite glass) charges final image weakly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stake (decoding knots) signaled early but pressure never tightens: fog thickens without raising stakes, no failed attempts or time pressure. Resolution occurs through epiphany alone; no visible price paid for knowledge. Escalation flat under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (knots as time-weaving) but final line states "ancient methods are safe," bordering on thematic echo. Avoids moralizing yet closure lacks conceptual repricing—wisdom preserved without cost undermines resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("oceanic hush," rope’s "logic in chaos") reflects Elara’s focus. Consistent psychic distance; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure. Minor register drift with "infinitely patient" slightly over-articulated for peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; rhythm varies ("fog rolled," "fingers traced"). Final beat’s "glowing softly" lacks propulsion. Near-miss on figurative muddle: "weavers had woven time itself" risks abstraction but saved by concrete knot imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed collecting/knot-reading creates organic metaphor. Avoids trope pitfalls through specific fulgurite glass detail. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative design) heightens coherence but safe emotional calibration limits boldness.</comment>
