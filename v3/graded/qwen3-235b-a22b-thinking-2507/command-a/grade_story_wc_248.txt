<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("rescue forgotten promise") drives action but lacks meaningful struggle or visible flaws; "volcanic tenderness" shows embodied contradiction yet remains static without testing under pressure. No inevitable mistakes compound choices, weakening causal earning of closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with tears as cost under Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation lacks pressure—clues yield effortlessly with no narrowing of options. Orientation clear early, yet missing meaningful tightening per scope requirements for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid archive atmosphere with dust/mural interaction, but setting never constrains choices or charges final image. Micro-setting (tapestry fragment) functions tactically yet fails to alter closure stakes per 9+ gate; sensory detail remains observational rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("rescue promise") with zero on-page conflict or resistance; no tightening of options occurs as clues solve themselves. Declared stakes never face concrete test, violating band guardrails for 8.0+—escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure under any lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice emerges through scroll discovery but collapses into explicit moralizing ("living testament to love and sacrifice") in final paragraph. Thematic echo triggers -0.6 penalty per rubric, undermining earned resonance with prompt-like language that replaces scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("analytically intuitive" shaping pattern recognition) with lyrical rhythm, but filter-verb stacks ("eyes narrowed," "recognized") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Minor register drift in "volcanic tenderness" avoids catastrophic voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Template cadence in clue sequence ("In one chamber... In a secluded chamber") creates paraphrase loops, while elevated diction ("volcanic tenderness") slightly clashes with POV lexicon. No closure damage but lacks zero-loop propulsion for 8.5+; density suffers from adjacent restatements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh "arsonist seeking preservation" angle transforms trope through specific voice, but emotional arc lacks non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking (volcanic tenderness) heightens coherence yet falls short of 8.5+ due to predictable quest structure without genuine stakes transformation.</comment>
