<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stated motivation ("tyranny of indifference") lacks embodied contradiction; flaws don't compound choices (enforcers solved too cleanly). "Underestimated" trait told not shown through micro-choices like key-handling stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly (vanishing with key), cost legible via transmitted ledger. But enforcers' arrival feels coincidental rather than causal escalation; "tyranny won't stand" assertion weakens conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Auric lagoon actively constrains choices (water resistance, star alignment necessity); final "winking stars" recharges closure. Puddle-reflection method shows sensory specificity missing in most submissions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. propaganda) tightens when enforcers force broadcast adaptation. But cost remains abstract ("couldn't outrun them" stated not embodied); no tradeoff alters tactics beyond the single solution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (stolen key, puddle map), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "coded freedom" without stating it, though "tyranny of indifference" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical consistency shines ("water cooling her nerves" embodies perception), but "suffixed humanity's spirit" shows register drift. Stress compression works ("mind raced"), though abstract jargon weakens stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean propulsion with purposeful density ("puddles revealed faint outline"), but template cadence in setup ("She was... She had...") and "carefully resourceful" redundancy dull momentum. No closure-beat artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes via specific details (puddle map, auric lagoon), but "phone booth key" feels derivative. Emotional truth in "underestimated" angle avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
