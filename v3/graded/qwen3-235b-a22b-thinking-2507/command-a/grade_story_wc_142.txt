<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "pride and exhaustion" and festival rally under strain, but "orderly intuitive" trait lacks visible tradeoffs; micro-choices (reorganizing rounds) miss embodied cost. BRR reflection exceeds 20% without anchoring micro-choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with conceptual cost ("fight far from over"), but Vorin's disruption attempt remains summarized not dramatized, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens. Two non-closure issues trigger -0.8 cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly anchors ("patchwork of barges"), but raft city never constrains choices—no micro-setting pressure during festival (e.g., unstable planks altering tactics). Fails 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (identity vs. erasure) tighten through graffiti discoveries, but Lira’s agency lacks protagonist-driven escalation; Vorin’s opposition feels external coincidence. Cost legible in "fight far from over" but not viscerally felt in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through graffiti’s "dual allegiance" and stone chip’s reweighted meaning, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("beacon of possibility") reconfigures "hopeful desperation" without stating morals, though tone shift leans slightly tell-heavy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vorin’s dialogue ("Progress is coming") lacks subtext and character-distinctive idiom; corporate-speak feels generic. Lira’s perceptual signature shines in decoding graffiti patterns, but voice convergence under stress weakens tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" repeats verbatim early/late, creating a paraphrase loop (-0.2). Otherwise clean propulsion and density; stone chip’s "jagged" detail avoids purple prose. Final line’s "beacon of possibility" earns resonance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Raft-city gentrification trope transformed via "culture shock absorber" specificity and graffiti-as-memory. Stone chip’s worn texture and festival reprise feel inevitable, though "foundation stone" echoes common fantasy motifs without full reinvention.</comment>
