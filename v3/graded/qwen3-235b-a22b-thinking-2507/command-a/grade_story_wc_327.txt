<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("hands trembled," "vision blurring") and credible endurance under drain, but lacks contradictory impulses during peak pressure—pure dedication overshadows self-preservation conflict until collapse. Motivation remains clear but uncomplicated by deeper internal fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: language preserved etched in canyon with visible cost ("copper veins faded," trembling collapse). Orientation succeeds early ("towers of bone...canyon of endless echoes" by word 15), but bird-flight method arrives late (60% mark), slightly weakening Accumulative escalation’s inevitability under the held lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("luminescent moss," "rustle of leaves") anchor atmosphere, yet canyon setting remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices—no moment where bone texture or echo patterns actively alter tactics. Final bird image resonates but isn’t charged by prior environmental specificity, missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (language extinction) intensify cleanly via energy drain cost, but bird-flight method feels coincidental rather than earned escalation—it "suddenly" appears without prior setup, undermining Accumulative pressure’s organic buildup. Agency in persistence is strong, yet resolution leans on external pattern rather than protagonist-driven pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through sensory translation emerges organically via "textures translated into sound" final image, avoiding moralizing. Bird motif’s late arrival slightly dilutes resonance, but closure’s "harmony" reweights prior struggle without sentimentality—earned through specific struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("voice a soft murmur that blended with echoes") and rhythmic control shine, especially during tension ("She took a deep breath... stepped into darkness"). Minor POV breach in "flock of birds seemed to sense her struggle" externalizes internal state unnaturally under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose generally propulsive with strong verbs ("jagged teeth," "coalesce"), but paraphrase loop in final third ("closed her eyes, letting sounds wash over her. She was searching for a pattern") dulls momentum. Final image’s clarity survives, but scaffold prevents 9+ eligibility per artifact cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of texture-to-sound translation via echo patterns elevates tropey elements (cursed diamond), yet bird-flight resolution lacks transformation—it’s a familiar "nature guides" device without specific grounding in Lira’s ancestral mastery. Emotional truth in language preservation feels earned but not revelatory.</comment>
