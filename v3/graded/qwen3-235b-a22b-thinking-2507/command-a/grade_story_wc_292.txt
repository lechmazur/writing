<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("spongey dread") without sufficient embodied contradiction; final choice lacks prior causality to feel fully earned despite strong motivation setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("true cost of bravery"), but the jet stream's role as "test of humanity's worthiness" feels underdeveloped in causality despite solid orientation and lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weather station details are vivid but static; the copper nail functions as micro-setting yet fails to actively constrain choices or charge the final image as required for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly through the ritual, but the dominant cost ("humanity's worthiness") remains abstract without concrete on-page manifestation beyond Elara's internal realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of legacy emerges organically through action, though final "gift" framing edges toward sentimentality; avoids moralizing but lacks the resonant non-literal answer required for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle but legible" journals, "spongey dread") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" doesn't undermine otherwise exceptional voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("she questioned the logic of it all") and mixed texture metaphor ("spongey dread coiling"); no closure-dulling artifacts but slight momentum drag in mid-beats prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological concepts with legacy themes; avoids weather clichés through specific jet stream mechanics, though "reversible exile" concept lacks deeper transformation beyond the core premise.</comment>
