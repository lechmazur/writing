<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; no earned stance crystallization as Elara accepts the call without meaningful trade-off. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond anticipation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure valid with conceptual cost (facing truth), but locket discovery feels coincidental; grandmother's foresight strains plausibility. Cost underdeveloped in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: shipwrecks apply pressure, mushrooms trigger digging, rusted locket charges closure. Final stars/fairy ring fusion reweights prior material perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes clear but escalation passive; locket discovery solves mystery without Elara's agency. No visible price paid or tactics altered—grandmother's clues undercut protagonist-driven narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through broken constellations evolving from childhood tales to actionable path. Final image resonates without moralizing, though "stolen memories" concept remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct folklorist perceptual signature: "skeletal shipwrecks," "luminescence." Rhythm modulates from reflective to urgent under pressure with clean psychic distance shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor cliché ("heart pounding with anticipation") and filter verbs ("she noticed") mar otherwise precise prose. No loops in closure beat; strong textural specificity in "timber beams groaning."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis through "hands-on folklorist" lens and sunken greenhouse setting. Avoids derivative tropes but "grandmother's clues" lacks sufficient transformation from familiar templates.</comment>
