<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied obsession but lacks contradictory impulses in action; final endurance lacks visible cost despite rich interiority. No trade-offs shown for "mildly obsessed" trait under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (vanishing star crystallizing the map), but cost legibility falters—no exact line pinpoints the sacrifice beyond implication. Accumulative lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (booklet) charges closure by growing "heavier," but the fort itself remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices. Sensory specificity excels yet environment doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping endless night) tightens via density increase, but no tangible cost is paid—only implied conceptual weight. Escalation driven by oracle’s agency, yet "felt cost" stays abstract despite the star’s vanishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silences-as-map metaphor; ending reweights "endless night" as earned conceptual cost without moralizing. Final image crystallizes complexity: the map is of "moments, of silences," avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ambered hush" as sensory anchor) with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early. Voice modulates flawlessly from "crackling" pages to "flickered and vanished" star.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless density but "ambered hush" repetition risks scaffold in mid-beats (e.g., "deepened, became palpable"). No closure artifacts; strategic telling compresses backstory without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "obsessed creator" trope via silences-as-cartography; specificity of "summarizing silence" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (non-causal structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though fort setting lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
