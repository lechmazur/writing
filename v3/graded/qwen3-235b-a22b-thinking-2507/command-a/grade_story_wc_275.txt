<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism/internal conflict shown via blade acceptance micro-choice, but "senselessly perceptive" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs; emotional summary ("heart tightened") lacks embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "blade sheathed at her side" crystallizes the conceptual cost of peace requiring readiness; Accumulative lens holds with pressure building through symbolic density ("quiet" engraving reweighting the final image).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome and desert roses constrain choices (fortifying enclosure, sandbag scrap for trellises) and charge closure ("tranquil blaze"); wasteland contrast avoids generic symbolism by shaping Elara's tactical decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when Kael's warning forces Elara's agency (refusing flight while accepting blade); cost of compromised pacifism visibly alters her tactics (carrying sheathed blade) and reweights the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>"Weave continuity through chaos" emerges organically through plant tending, avoiding moralizing; final "tranquil blaze" image answers the central question with conceptual cost (peace now requires vigilance), resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong in sensory details ("scent of blooming flowers"), but "senses on high alert" slips into label-only phrasing; Kael's dialogue lacks distinctive voice during pivotal blade exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Her mission was clear: to weave continuity through chaos" is tell-not-show scaffolding; "heart tightened" is cliché, but final image ("tranquil blaze") achieves high density without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "bounty hunter's daughter" trope through desert rose farm specificity; "tranquil blaze" tone innovation elevates familiar stakes, though Kael's motivation lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
