<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s "emotionally rational" trait lacks embodied tradeoffs; her smooth archive discovery avoids genuine struggle. Contradictory impulses ("truth vs. humanity of lies") emerge only at closure without prior friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "pit of lies was a little shallower" crystallizes cost through the rosebush’s bare branches. Missing setup: no tangible opposition narrows options before the ledger’s easy riddle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy-choked tracks and cracked mirror actively constrain choices, charging the final image. Rosebush’s "bare branches" reweight truth’s cost perfectly. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmospheric window dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when Elara sees "humanity behind lies," but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. The archive’s discovery relies on luck (loose floorboard), not earned tactics under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rosebush’s decay and ledger’s "seed" riddle, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "noble lies" as contextualized burdens, but secondary "truth vs. stability" tension feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV voice shines in sensory specificity ("scent of damp earth and decay"), but "mind worked like a loom" breaks Elara’s rational texture with uncharacteristic metaphor. Perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose flows with purposeful rhythm, yet "illuminated letter" descriptions stack filter verbs ("shimmering faintly," "her key, her map"). Near-closure density avoids artifacts, but minor scaffold dilutes high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historical truth-seeking with physical decay (rosebush/station) avoids trope. Risk in quiet closure pays off, but "fictional historian" archetype lacks transformative specificity to breach 8.5.</comment>
