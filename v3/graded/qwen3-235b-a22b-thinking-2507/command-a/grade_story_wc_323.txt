<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Diagnostic label "balancedly curious" breaks immersion twice; strong embodied choices otherwise (grip tightening on chain, ritual blending), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (chain resonance/stars) with conceptual cost, but visible price of preserving towers remains abstract; orientation clear, lens (Accumulative/Textural) held coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Benthic city details vivid but static; anchor chain constrains choice (pedestal ritual) and charges final image, yet "edge geometry" remains ornamental rather than pressuring tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (obsolete towers) tighten meaningfully, but cost lacks tangible on-page consequence; escalation driven by agency yet resolution feels frictionless without sacrificed opportunity or credibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (chain/star ritual), but "unfolded horizons" leans toward thematic echo; final image reweights premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (navigation-focused bias) shines; "somber marvel" descriptor slightly flattens voice, yet rhythmic control under pressure remains precise and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is clinical diction in peak beats; minor paraphrase loops ("wonder, but also uncertainty" / "fear was a poor compass") dull immediacy without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deep-sea/alien navigation avoids genre clichés; risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, though "edge geometry" lacks transformative specificity.</comment>
