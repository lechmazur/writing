<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in memory sacrifice hesitation—fear of loss versus belief in order—but final epiphany ("threads in a tapestry") edges toward over-articulation, slightly diluting earned ambiguity in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the reformed prism’s song reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (sacrificed memories), while causal star-path alignment drives every escalation beat without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass pavilion’s hum actively constrains choices (guiding telescope use) and charges the finale (vibrating walls), but generic "bustling city" backstory lacks specificity, narrowly missing the 9+ gate for micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—star alignment deepens knowledge, ritual forces memory sacrifice—with visible cost (fading past) altering tactics; coincidence complicates but never resolves, per Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from shard reassembly ("threads in a tapestry"), avoiding moralizing, yet the final line’s explicit "coincidences were not random" borders on thematic echo, slightly undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thistle-blown hope," "retrocognitively blessed") persists under stress with rhythmic compression during sacrifice; no head-hopping, and lyric elision (dream sequences) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("hands trembling with hope"/"dreams filled with visions") in high-pressure beat risks scaffold, but zero figurative muddle in closure; propulsion remains razor-sharp despite one near-duplicate stem.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Risk-taking elevates tropes: "retrocognitively blessed" shard transforms post-apoc hope into tangible mechanics, while memory sacrifice feels inevitable through prior causality—fresh synthesis with emotional specificity.</comment>
