<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "spatially gifted mind" label lacks embodied tradeoffs. Father's lesson drives motivation but micro-choices passive (follows footprints without tactical shift). Final endurance earned, but felt cost lacks physical specificity beyond "strange peace".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure: "boundaries are permeable" reconfiguration carries conceptual cost (worldview shift). Accumulative lens holds—mushroom glow density increase tightens stakes. Orientation clear by 100 words; no causality breaks. Missing one visible cost escalation beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms constrain choice (navigation, footprint detection) and charge final image ("light growing brighter"). Sensory specificity ("damp soil", "flickering like quiet wildfire") filters through Elara's spatial perception. Micro-setting elevates to 9-band by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boundary philosophy) signaled early, but escalation passive—figure hands mushroom; no protagonist-driven tightening. "Footprints" deepening changes knowledge, yet pressure lacks active trade-offs. Cost felt (worldview shift) but not visibly paid in tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "permeable barriers" theme emerges through mushroom farm interactions. Final image reweights boundaries as bridges without stating moral. But "familiar strangers are just bridges" borders on thematic echo (-0.3), slightly muddying earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: spatial mapping ("mapped layout effortlessly") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control in "flickering like quiet wildfire" intensifies pressure. Minor filter verbs ("she noticed") don't dull immediacy; lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("ripple, as if something passed through permeable barriers"). Final line’s "quiet wildfire burning in her heart" charges closure without muddle. One synonym churn ("deliberate"/"steady" steps) costs 0.2 in high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: intrusion specialist meets bioluminescent physics metaphor. Emotional specificity in "laser button as father’s legacy" avoids trope. But "revolutionize" premise leans familiar; risks hedged by middle-ground philosophical resolution.</comment>
