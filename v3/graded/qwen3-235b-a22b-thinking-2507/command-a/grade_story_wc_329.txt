<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (shell's pulse, heartbeat sync) avoids abstraction; contradictory impulses (fear/resolve) manifest in trembling hands yet steady bow. No diagnostic labels, but emotional progression slightly tidy—minimal struggle before breakthrough weakens flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: shell's inertness post-fulfillment crystallizes the "gap between knowing and understanding." Accumulative lens holds—sensory density escalates (whispers to trembling earth) narrowing options. Cost proof: "purpose fulfilled, but its message remained" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Locust shell functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (placed against chest to sync heartbeat) and charges closure (inert yet resonant). "Tarnished wonder" evolves tactilely—roots "twisting like serpents" and brightening hues mirror internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking free via reawakening beauty) tightens through protagonist agency: heartbeat sync decision forces trade-off (risking statue detection). Cost is legible—shell's inertness post-victory alters no future tactics but charges final image with conceptual weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("beauty could be reawakened... shell now inert") offers non-literal answer to "how to restore orchard" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete action (syncing heartbeat) not abstraction; avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in shell's transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures (shell's "hollow curves," "tarnished wonder") and sounds ("whispers growing urgent"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax—"Roots began to uproot... statues advanced"—with compression serving pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("violin carved from fallen star hummed... breathe life into air" fuses setting/theme). Final line recharges locust shell motif with propulsion. No figurative muddle—cadence shifts organically from "delicate thread" to "music swelled."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope via specific mechanics (heartbeat sync, locust shell signal). "Tarnished wonder" tone avoids generic decay; emotional truth in "gap between knowing/understanding" grounds universality. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
