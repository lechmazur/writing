<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong in Kael's fragility/power tension, but woman's grief lacks embodied specificity; "beauty can be both fragile and powerful" triggers diagnostic label penalty (-0.5) in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates through sun-trail ritual to Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "journey far from over" crystallizing purpose with felt weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting charging final image, but floating tea house remains decorative backdrop; environment fails to constrain choices despite vivid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding story-magnetism) tightens through woman's exchange to Kael's purpose crystallization; passive agency fits Accumulative lens but cost slightly abstract ("journey far from over").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; final image reweights morpho wing's iridescence as shared illumination without stating theme. Near-miss on thematic echo with "illuminate" phrasing in dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical texture strong but filter verbs ("he could feel") dull immediacy; "quietly explosive" descriptor abstracts internal state. Rhythmic control falters during reflective backstory fragment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("whispers fading"/"voice soft"); strategic telling compresses backstory but "churning with questions" slightly overwrites. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dye-master specificity transforms healing-journey trope, but floating tea house feels derivative. Risk in Accumulative structure elevates premise though not fully indispensable.</comment>
