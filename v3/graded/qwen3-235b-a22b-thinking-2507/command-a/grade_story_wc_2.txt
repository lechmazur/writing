<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Protagonist lacks interior contradiction; epiphany about embracing uncertainty feels unearned without prior struggle. "Befriending uncertainty" conclusion shows no visible cost or trade-off, violating Earned Stasis requirement for closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens holds through closure: Charged Poise achieved when tinkerer folds the map, with cost legible in "lighter" compass and greenhouse's transformed perception. Orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall chamber constrains choice—water wading charges the map retrieval—and bioluminescence literally illuminates the thematic shift. Final greenhouse image recharges prior decay with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("uncertainty") without concrete testing; protagonist passively follows compass rather than wrestling with the core conflict. "Coincidence becomes pattern" insight lacks causal pressure from earlier choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (releasing map) without moralizing. Final image of crafting "devices that celebrate mysteries" offers resonant, non-literal answer to time's nature, reweighting the workshop's opening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overuse of filter verbs ("he felt," "he noticed") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats. Tinkerer's voice lacks distinctiveness—reflections sound generically philosophical rather than tinkerer-specific under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding ("he knew this was no ordinary artifact; it was a key") and repetitive sentence structures in cavern scene. No fatal loops, but "swirling leaves" motif slightly over-decorated without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-story-carrier trope through specific objects (compass rose, charred map). Risk-taking in quiet closure lands cleanly, but hedging on protagonist's internal struggle limits emotional complexity.</comment>
