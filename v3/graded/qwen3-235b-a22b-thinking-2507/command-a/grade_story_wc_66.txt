<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation "teach dust to tell stories" is vivid but interior contradiction lacks depth; embodied excitement ("hand moving frantically") strong, yet final resolve feels unearned without prior struggle against fatigue or doubt during transcription.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—abandoning quill for notebook crystallizes stance with felt cost ("quill and parchment forgotten")—but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) weakens escalation; radio’s agency blurs causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic setting ("ember alcove in mist") constrains choice by muffling world and focusing Clara’s attention; recurring radio glow charges closure as catalyst, though "damp wood" scent lacks tactical impact on transcription decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrecting stories) tightens via broadcast’s arrival, narrowing options from transcription to lyric capture; cost legible in abandoned quill, but "story famine" remains abstract—no concrete loss (e.g., ink depletion, time pressure) alters tactics mid-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust/radio interplay, but "teach dust to tell stories" borders on thematic echo; final resolve ("one note, one word") risks moralizing without deeper interrogation of storytelling’s cost in famine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fragments spoke of forgotten worlds"), yet tense shifts ("Clara felt," "she knew") dilute immediacy; lyric compression works, but "thistled calm" feels imposed rather than character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose sings with "luminous face" and "mist clung to windows," but "methodical, her strokes precise" scaffold dulls momentum; minor synonym loops ("fleeting shadows"/"faint luminescence") sap density in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "story famine" with radio as narrative vessel elevates trope; "dust to tell stories" motif feels inevitable, though "pirate broadcast" lacks transformative grounding in Clara’s copyist expertise.</comment>
