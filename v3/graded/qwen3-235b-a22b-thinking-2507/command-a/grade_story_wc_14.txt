<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("hands trembling," "quill barely keeping pace") but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear yet unchallenged despite pivotal discovery, missing the required friction for high-band escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orientation solid by line 30, closure valid as Earned Stasis with felt cost ("hands trembling slightly"), but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the hum's intensification doesn't narrow options or reweight stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("moss-covered ground," "leaves rustling") anchor setting, but bonsai forests remain decorative; no constraint on choices or charge to final image, failing the 9+ gate requiring functional integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting histories) signaled early, but pressure never coheres—the "different" hum creates no genuine conflict or choice; under Accumulative lens, density increase fails to reweight stakes with tangible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through texture ("refracting textures of different times"), but final paragraph slightly over-explains ("deepened her connection... life's purpose"), edging toward thematic echo that undermines earned subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chart the faint hum") with rhythmic control, but voice lacks modulation under stress—lyrical flow persists during climax ("hand moved swiftly") without compression that should heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats ("flood of images and sounds" after subtle hum setup); template cadence in paragraph 2 ("She moved... footsteps soft") dulls immediacy without closure-damaging loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise (charting time-textures via lamp hum) lacks transformative risk; "gilded-leaf stationer" remains poetic label without organic integration into conflict, missing 9+ requirement for inevitable synthesis.</comment>
