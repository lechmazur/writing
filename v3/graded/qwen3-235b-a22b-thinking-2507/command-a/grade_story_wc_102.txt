<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to find "unused love" drives tangible choices (kneeling, following sparks) with embodied cost; past-life memories avoid therapy-speak via concrete temple/lover imagery but slight tell in "memories flooded her mind" slightly flattens interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Elara transforms "weight" of unexpressed love into purpose ("love... now carried within her"), with felt cost in the alcove’s light. Causal lens holds through each beat (dream→discovery→revelation), and the persistent constraint of the pendant shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct functions as micro-setting: wisteria’s scent triggers breath-slowing that reveals the spark, constraining Elara’s kneeling action; the blossoms’ "hum" in the final image recharges the setting’s role in storing love, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the pendant’s glow forces Elara to follow sparks toward the alcove, narrowing options from passive observation to active pilgrimage. The cost—confronting past-life failure—is legible in the "warmth spread through her chest" that resolves the opening "trembling," though escalation lacks one deeper micro-choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "unused love is stored within her" crystallizes via the pendant’s placement, avoiding moralizing. The final image of blossoms "humming with newfound life" reweights the opening "skeletal ribcage" metaphor with earned resonance, though secondary "healing the world" hint slightly overreaches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lens trained on the horizon where the sky bled") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats ("She placed the tear... alcove erupted in light"); no head-hopping, though "foggy lucidity" description edges toward thematic tell without sufficient action integration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "hands trembled" repeats in opening paragraph, and "breath" recurs excessively ("breathed in... breath slowing... breath steadying"). Otherwise, clean propulsion and vivid texture, but scaffold prevents 8.5+ band despite strong closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "past-life discovery" trope via camera obscura artist lens and Kwan Yin tear specificity; "pilgrim of sparks" concept feels fresh through breathing mechanics. Emotional truth anchors universality in wisteria’s scent and iron’s coolness, avoiding spiritual cliché.</comment>
