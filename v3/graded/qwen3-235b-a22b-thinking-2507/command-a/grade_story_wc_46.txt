<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in trauma creates authentic contradictory impulses (fear of fire vs. sharing light); final endurance earned through polished action. Memories transform from burdens to resilience without tidy resolution, but global cap applies due to Q7 artifact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with legible cost ("memories no longer felt like burdens"); accumulative lens holds via polishing density increase. Reflection adheres to BRR, but global cap prevents 9.0 despite flawless causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sea glass micro-setting constrains choice (polishing method) and charges final image; grotto mist mirrors internal state. "Zephyr bloom" slightly mars specificity, but global cap limits higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation through polishing intensity reweights stake under accumulative lens; cost legible in transformed relationship to memories. Single deepening sufficient for length, but global cap applies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image reweights "stillness" without moralizing; subtext in gestures avoids thematic echo. Resonant answer to light/fire dichotomy, but global cap prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (tactile focus on glass edges); rhythmic compression during polishing heightens pressure. No head-hopping, but global cap applies due to Q7 artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" register drift in closure beat dulls final image; otherwise clean propulsion and density. Artifact in final third triggers -0.5 penalty and global 9+ disallowance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craft/resilience; risk-taking in quiet closure avoids abstraction. Emotional specificity elevates premise, but global cap applies.</comment>
