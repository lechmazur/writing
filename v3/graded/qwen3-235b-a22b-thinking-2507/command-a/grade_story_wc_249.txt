<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("auroral sorrow that clung to her was not just hers") but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses in key beat; transformation feels unearned as drumming habit doesn't actively constrain choices until passive lagoon interaction. Diagnostic phrasing edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens succeeds with hum resonance reconfiguring stakes, but cost proof fails: tears transforming to "purifying" lacks concrete legibility of sacrifice. Lens holds consistently through cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as micro-setting where drumming habit directly constrains the climax—stone perch enables lagoon resonance that charges the final image. Avoids white-room syndrome through sensory-specific pressure ("waters shimmering like liquid memory").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via lagoon's hum intensifying the entangled memories conflict, but escalation relies on coincidence (water responding) rather than protagonist agency. Cost ("auroral sorrow" transforming) is felt but not concretely legible as required for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through drumming motif evolving from chaos to connection, avoiding moralizing. Final "weaver of dreams" image reweights shared dream concept without stating morals, but lacks meaningful ambiguity about ongoing struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers drumming on everything") and rhythmic control shine, but epiphany paragraph shows uniform tics ("she saw... she felt...") undermining stress compression. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively until climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "entangled memories" repetition (4x in 3 paras) creates synonym churn. Final paragraph's template cadence ("As she walked... the drumming...") dulls closure image despite strong opening imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transforms memory-trope through sound-specific sensory details, but lagoon-as-therapist device feels derivative. Emotional truth in shared grief avoids generic templates, yet lacks one fresh inflection growing from prior particulars for 8.5+ band.</comment>
