<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Label-heavy interiority ("ethical dilemmas," "boundaries") lacks embodied contradiction; reversal decision feels unearned without micro-choices showing value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with "catalyst" cost reference, but Accumulative escalation lacks agency-driven pressure buildup—epiphany emerges passively without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dome and story stick create rich atmosphere but fail to constrain choices; final image lacks tangible cost linkage despite lyrical resonance with the stick.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes clear but conflict static—no escalation under Accumulative lens; argument's emotional cost remains abstract without viscerally felt trade-offs during the reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through story stick/puppets but "catalyst" phrasing edges toward thematic echo; final dawn image reweights reversal without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-focused noticing, but peak stress lacks syntactic compression—elevated diction ("meteor hush") overrides character-specific voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant prose marred by synonym loops ("half-lit epiphanies/moments of clarity") and final-third thematic echo ("testament to power of reversal") dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Specific radar dome/stick details ground familiar introspection arc, but core "reversal" premise remains swappable (puppets → poetry) without transformative risk.</comment>
