<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("boundary-lessly trapped" vs purpose) manifests physically in palm-biting grip and calcified soul fissure, but "to understand begins with myself" risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied struggle in the choice moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (crack in calcified layers) under Accumulative/Textural lens; starlight reconfiguration of her weaving patterns crystallizes the stance shift, though the "crack" could be more viscerally rendered to elevate cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp burner functions as micro-setting: warmth grounds her, flickering mirrors uncertainty, and its final brightening charges the closure image while constraining her physical reality in the grotto's damp chill.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (purpose vs self-preservation) tighten through the figure's questioning, narrowing options to continuation or transformation; the "crack" reweights tactics as she shifts weaving focus, though escalation leans slightly on dialogue over embodied pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by making "shingled hush" a lived constraint, but "purpose can be a trap" edges toward thematic echo; final image of self-weaving reweights the concept through action rather than statement, though abstraction lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spider’s web catching threads of sorrows," "whalebone reverie") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s fractal map imagery without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat with high density ("flame wavering as if uncertain of its own purpose"), but "spider’s web" metaphor slightly overwrites the tension; rhythmic control sustains propulsion through "kerosene lamp burner" repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms burden-bearer trope through fractal mechanics and bronze grotto specificity; "calcified soul" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
