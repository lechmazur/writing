<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for "shape of home" is clear but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; embodied emotion remains abstract ("pain of remembering") without specific physical cost during climax. Therapy-speak ("catalyst") in peak beat weakens interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (maze reconfigured as path) with felt cost ("hidden thunder passed, leaving quiet strength"), but the conceptual cost lacks concrete anchoring; storm imagery resolves too cleanly without irreversible physical or relational consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bookstore labyrinth functions as active micro-setting: shelves "groaning" and rearranging directly constrain Elara's movement and charge the final image; feather texture’s recurrence elevates closure beyond decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via accumulative pressure (stone’s pulse → crackling air → roaring thunder), but agency feels passive ("letting her mind drift"); the cost ("quiet strength") remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through feather/stone motifs; final image ("maze no longer prison but path") reweights "home" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action: "seed her thoughts" crystallizes the abstract into physical consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("movements mirroring shifting light") persists under pressure, but stress-induced diction stays overly poetic ("letting it guide her") rather than compressing into urgent fragments during the stone’s activation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("She closed... letting... focusing... letting") creates rhythmic monotony; "realm where boundaries blurred" is redundant phrasing that dulls propulsion in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "buried talents" trope through bookstore-specific logic (stone as mirror); risks lyrical compression but maintains coherence. Derivative "lost language" device redeemed by feather texture’s irreplaceable role in closure.</comment>
