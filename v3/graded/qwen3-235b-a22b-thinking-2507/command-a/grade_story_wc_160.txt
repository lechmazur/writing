<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (doubt/hope) embodied through chain handling; micro-choices reveal value hierarchy during design sketch. Slightly abstract "dappled resolve" dilutes embodied emotion at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (trembling → resolve), but adhesive analysis feels retroactive rather than causally earned. Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric pressure tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dormant volcano amphitheater actively constrains choice via chain measurements and breathing walls that charge the final image. Environment's cracks evolve from threat to "beauty in imperfection" with perfect thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonizing values) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options; pressure grows texturally rather than through Elias's agency-driven choices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" emerges organically through adhesive clue and chain poem, avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights "to break is to mend" as resonant answer without stated moral, though "slyly heartfelt" leans thematic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Machinist perceptual signature shines in gear-like thought process and tool-focused noticing. Minor register drift in "dappled with doubt" slightly disrupts voice consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No fatal artifacts, but adjacent paraphrase loop ("cracks along the walls... cracks glowing") and abstract "ancient secrets" reduce propulsion. Final image's "weight of achievement" carries slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering precision and poetic metaphor avoids trope; specific chain inscriptions transform familiar volcano setting. Risk-taking in "encrypted compassion" concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
