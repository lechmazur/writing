<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—doubt versus hope—drives the pruning action with embodied cost ("tingling in fingertips"), but grandmother’s wisdom risks thematic echo without sufficient friction in her choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the glowing fruit’s bite crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (doubt transformed into shared hope), though celestial alignment’s urgency isn’t leveraged for escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains choice (pruning vines to reshape space) and charges the final image, but sensory detail leans visual-heavy; rain scent mentioned but not woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s pruning—a meaningful deepening—but celestial alignment’s "once-in-a-lifetime" pressure remains abstract; cost is felt (doubt) but not viscerally paid until the fruit’s bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through pruning motif and fruit’s memory flood, avoiding moralizing; grandmother’s dialogue skirts thematic echo but gains weight through Elara’s physical action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains anchored in Elara’s sensory culinary lens ("warmth of shared meal"), yet stress-induced thought compression is missing; voice modulates well but could fracture under peak doubt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops but risks overwriting ("glow of a thousand moons"); "synaptic plasticity" feels jarringly clinical in otherwise textured narration, dulling momentum in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "gentle rebellion" via memory-tasting chef and knowledge fruit avoids tropes; pruning metaphor gains specificity through horticultural action, though celestial alignment leans familiar.</comment>
