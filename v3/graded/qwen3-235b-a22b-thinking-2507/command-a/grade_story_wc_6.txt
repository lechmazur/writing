<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is abstract ("scars can sing") rather than embodied; diagnostic phrasing in climax ("scars... sang") triggers -0.4 penalty. Motivation clear but micro-choices lack tangible stakes under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (uncertain growth), but cost legibility falters—no exact image anchors sacrifice. Orientation clear early, but lens (Accumulative/Textural) lacks density increase at pivotal grafting moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand actively constrain choice (sterile soil), charging the final image. "Red thread against black sand" crystallizes tension; environment shapes every action from coin handling to seed placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving scars sing) remains abstract, never viscerally tested. Ritual planting lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or trade-offs. Cloud migration hints at time pressure but doesn't alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grafting ritual's concrete failure risk, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("scars sang") reweights premise but edges toward thematic echo with "resilience" abstraction, missing 9+ gate's non-literal precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (firefighter's tactile focus) sustains through "calloused hands" to "stained with sand." Minor syntactic monotony in lyrical passages ("her... her...") prevents 9.0 despite rhythmic control under storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but elevated diction ("kelp-drift peace") clashes with firefighter POV in closure. High density achieved, though "roared above, their shadows dancing" slightly overwrites cloud pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope via volcanic setting specifics; black sand's sterility creates fresh moral calculus. Risk-taking in lyric closure succeeds, but "scars can sing" metaphor lacks the non-obvious synthesis for 9.0.</comment>
