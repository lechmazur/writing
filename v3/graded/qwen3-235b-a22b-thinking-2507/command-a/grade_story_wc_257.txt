<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Embodied grief via tracing stencil and origami folding, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension at climax; "hollow" remains abstract without visceral struggle during tattoo decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with tattoo as visible cost, but curtain activation relies on coincidence rather than causal pressure; "chosen" revelation lacks prior setup about their power.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: telescope and curtains directly constrain choices, with glass-filtered starlight charging the final pendant image; "artificial" trait underutilized beyond description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens when stencil glows, but pressure isn't protagonist-driven; Elara's passivity during curtain activation undercuts escalation under Accumulative lens where attention should deepen meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Teach withering to bloom" emerges through crumbling greenhouse and hollowed tree, avoiding moralizing; final whisper reweights the phrase with earned resonance without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air hummed with weight of centuries") but climax diction flattens: "suddenly," "startled," and "pulsing with life" feel tell-y rather than embodied under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in closure beat ("renewed determination... confidence... words felt like promise") dulls final image; strong opening lines undermined by scaffold in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms mourning trope via botanist husband and observatory, but "curtains of intention" risks symbolic convenience; specificity in "hollowed by age" avoids generic decay tropes.</comment>
