<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "quietly driven" remains label-only; micro-choices under pressure lack concrete tradeoffs despite strong embodied emotion in cathedral scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost ("postcards felt heavier"), but orientation drift in dream sequence slightly delays concrete stakes beyond 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber pavilion and etched glass constrain choices (brush poised, tracing postcard); final image's "umbral tenderness" charges closure through recurring light motifs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("whispered secrets," "weathered stone"), but external pressure lacks concrete opposition; cost is felt not enacted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights "why flowers bloom at night" through earned specificity (moonflower memory), avoiding moralizing while resonating with dawning hush motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in glass-etched details; rhythmic control under pressure flawless ("snow dissolving like a sigh"), no head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("quietly driven"/"quiet drive") and one paraphrase loop ("love, loss, and longing... secrets") in postcard description prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms cathedral trope through artist's tactile engagement; moonflower memory provides fresh emotional calculus, though "umbral tenderness" edges toward familiar lyricism.</comment>
