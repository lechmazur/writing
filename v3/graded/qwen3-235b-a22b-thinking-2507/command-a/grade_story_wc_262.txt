<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s quest for "unused love" versus her own unspoken words, with embodied cost in her trembling hands and racing mind; minor deduction for "spatially imaginative quest" phrasing bordering on therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara’s descent reconfigures the theater’s meaning with felt cost ("she thought of her own life, of the loves she had left unspoken"), under a coherent Accumulative lens where letter accumulation narrows emotional options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as potent micro-setting—dusty reels and moonlight constrain choices by supplying the film strip; final image ("theater felt less like a relic") charges closure through environmental reweighting, though physicality doesn’t actively alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: letters’ merging deepens the quest’s cost ("Where did this love go?"), but the conceptual price lacks the "unmistakable" on-page visibility required for 9+; agency in taking the strip forecloses passive observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—goodbye letters reconfigure "unused love" into actionable purpose without moralizing; final line ("it didn’t have to stay that way") resonates as non-literal answer to the central question with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers brushed worn railing, each step a whisper of history") modulates with pressure; minor register drift in "spatially imaginative quest" slightly disrupts voice cohesion during high-stakes reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hushed thunder" and "echoes of forgotten emotions" showcase rhythmic control and textural specificity, though "pulsed with quiet energy" edges toward generic phrasing in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Unused love" premise transforms cliché through psychometry’s tactile logic and the film strip’s physicality; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, but setting specificity lacks transformative freshness.</comment>
