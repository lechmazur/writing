<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear vs optimism) embodied in micro-choices like pocketing the eyes despite danger; "diagnostic label-speak" near-miss in "mathematics of emotion" avoided by concrete actions like sketching shadows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (ignoring mentor's warning for potential breakthrough); causal linkage holds from mosaic discovery to final harmony realization, but danger remains abstract without visceral manifestation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cavern orchard functions as micro-setting: stalactite drip enables orchard, roots conceal discoveries, and final glow recharges "silence" with thematic weight; environment directly constrains choices and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency—deciphering mosaic narrows options from curiosity to perilous understanding—but cost stays conceptual (unheeded warning) rather than visceral, limiting emotional punch at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard's transformed glow ("silence no longer empty") as non-literal answer to ambiguous loss; avoids moralizing while reweighting "harmony over control" via concrete action, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stalactite drip" and "shimmering fruit" with rhythmic control; minor tension between lyrical density ("dovetailed into a theory") and clarity under pressure in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with zero loops, but final paragraph risks abstraction ("promise of understanding") slightly dulling closure's visceral charge despite strong propulsion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic system with emotional theory; specific details (taxidermist eyes, mosaic codes) transform tropes, though resolution leans safe by prioritizing intellectual over physical stakes.</comment>
