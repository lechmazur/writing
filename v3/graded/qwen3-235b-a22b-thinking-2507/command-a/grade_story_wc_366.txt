<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias' reticence versus observant nature drives action (noticing stone stack), but "luminescent ache" motivation lacks causal grounding; final resolve earns cost through embodied warmth of sea glass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (sea glass, stones) escalates pressure toward Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "luminescent ache" resolving to "quiet resolve" at dawn without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sea glass constrains choices (triggers stone rearrangement) and charges final image ("felt warmer"); lantern room's flickering lamp actively shapes tactics rather than serving as static backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (rearranging stones) under Accumulative lens; cost manifests in prior emotional void ("ache") replaced by resolve, with "protect the light" demand reweighting his purpose visibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (bottling safety via stones/glass), avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "luminescent ache" into earned wisdom without abstract statements or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant eyes" noticing gulls/sea glass) modulates under pressure; minor abstraction in "luminescent ache" slightly undermines otherwise controlled rhythm during lamp flicker crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding loops; "sea glass felt warmer" crystallizes closure with textural specificity. Slight overwriting in "luminescent ache" but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through specific stone-coding mechanics and "bottling safety" concept; emotional authenticity in quiet keeper's resolve avoids safety-middle hedging.</comment>
