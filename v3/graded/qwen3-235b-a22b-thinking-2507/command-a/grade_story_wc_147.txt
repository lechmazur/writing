<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation shift from survival to discovery is earned but lacks contradictory impulses during critical choice; "lonesome splendor" epiphany borders on therapy-speak despite strong embodied fear-to-wonder progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with oxygen depletion cost, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) persists past midpoint; "time running short" pressure isn't leveraged in the final beat's crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Temple setting constrains choices through shifting walls and oxygen scarcity, but sensory details occasionally stall momentum ("alcove adorned with symbols"); crystal chamber's glow charges the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant oxygen stake tightens meaningfully, but "gathered hush" concept never actively pressures choices—it remains atmospheric rather than altering tactics under Accumulative lens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal imagery but final paragraph's explicit "chance to understand... share with the world" moralizing triggers Thematic Echo penalty; "ephemeral" concept lacks sufficient concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in marine-biologist POV ("carvings told tales"), but "lonesome splendor" repetition creates template cadence; tense/stage control flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity marred by stock metaphors ("essence of temple's forgotten secrets") and paraphrase loops in memory sequences; final line's "unsravel secrets for generations" slightly overwrites.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Memory-vial twist on underwater temple trope shows ingenuity, but "distress signal sender" role feels derivative; emotional specificity in solitude elevates beyond generic adventure template.</comment>
