<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in numbness-as-shield vs. yearning is embodied through tactile actions, but micro-choices under pressure lack layered irrationality; the needle discovery feels slightly convenient without prior hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the tear and realization, but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (Accumulative/Textural only solidifies during song reversal), costing high-band eligibility despite felt cost in "raw, aching aliveness."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drum maker's cavern functions as essential micro-setting: the drum she traces early constrains her final tap, charging closure through tactile specificity ("resonated deep within her") without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency (reversing songs), but escalation lacks one visible price altering tactics; the "faint rustle of turning seasons" signals time pressure yet never constrains her choices within the cavern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "filament of hush" motif, culminating in non-literal closure ("space where all possibilities resided"); avoids moralizing while reweighting silence as possibility through her drum tap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile vocabulary ("vibrations told stories," "music seeping into bones"), but psychic distance wavers when describing "legends spoke of their power" as external knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose avoids major loops but "faint rustle of turning seasons" repeats verbatim with minimal pressure; high density in reversal sequence ("melodies distorted yet hauntingly beautiful") fuels momentum without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deaf musician premise transforms tropes through tactile music, but "backward songs" method lacks fresh inflection; emotional specificity in "tear rolling down her cheek" elevates beyond template.</comment>
