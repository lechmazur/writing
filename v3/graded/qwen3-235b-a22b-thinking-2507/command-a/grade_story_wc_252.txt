<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("guarded heart"/"Swan" identity) drives action; "combative tenderness" finale embodies earned vulnerability without therapy-speak. Flaw: motivation ("true nature") remains abstract despite strong embodied choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scrimshaw discovery → dream → journey → island → detachment. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with felt cost (lost scrimshaw, gained self-acceptance) in final image. No orientation debt; anchors by line 5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe constrains every choice: wading for scrimshaw, rowing into deep water, island's sand sinking boots. Whalebone scrimshaw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("essence still with her").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (self-acceptance) tightens via scrimshaw's dream call → island barrier → detachment choice. Cost legible in "scrimshaw gone but its essence still with her." Escalation driven by agency under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: guarded heart barrier → physical scrimshaw key → "combative tenderness" resolution. Final line reweights "freedom" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via embodied action over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ocean’s breath whispered secrets," "amber and violet" sky) modulates with emotional intensity. Rhythmic control in climax ("barrier dissolved... call grew louder") avoids lyric sprawl. Zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding; "calloused hands... belied her grace" shows not tells. Minor abstraction in "combative tenderness" phrase (line 48) slightly dulls closure image. No loops or cadence errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms self-discovery trope via maritime specificity: disappearing island as "right heart" summons, scrimshaw as key. Avoids derivative pitfalls through "sublittoral fringe" occupational texture and earned emotional truth.</comment>
