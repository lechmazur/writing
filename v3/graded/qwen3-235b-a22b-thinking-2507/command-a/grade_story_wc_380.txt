<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but "sand through fingers" cliché dilutes embodiment. Final realization feels unearned as experiment succeeds perfectly with no visible struggle during ritual. No micro-choices under pressure alter tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("memories merely misplaced"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—the ritual proceeds smoothly without narrowing options. Air shift/tug feels convenient rather than pressure-built; cost emerges only at endpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Salt crystals charge the final image ("silent watch") and constrain perception via light/shadow interplay, but environment never pressures choices during the ritual. Strong sensory specificity in "dancing shadows" yet fails to alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—no reversal, deepening, or trade-off during the ritual. Cost is conceptual yet felt only at closure; "air shifted" escalation feels unearned without prior friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wildflowers/coffee grounds as concrete particulars; final line "misplaced" offers resonant non-literal answer to memory’s nature. Avoids moralizing but edges toward neat resolution ("puzzle solved"), slightly diluting complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows danced like memories") and rhythmic control under pressure; "fragments of light" simile slightly generic but compensated by precise lexicon ("exhume reality"). Elision (whale backstory) taught early via wildflowers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with clean propulsion, but "sand through fingers" cliché and "fragments of light" dilute specificity. No loops or scaffold, though generic phrasing in peak beats slightly obscures emotional texture without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory physics with salt crystals avoids abstraction; emotional specificity in personal quest elevates familiar premise. Transformation test passed—changing names would alter impact—but "misplaced memories" concept lacks deeper reinvention.</comment>
