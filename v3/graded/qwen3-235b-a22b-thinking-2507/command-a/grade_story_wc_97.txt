<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied (fingers bleeding from piano playing), but "strategically creative" trait lacks on-page testing under pressure; micro-choices remain passive rather than revealing value hierarchies during the reel immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves valid Charged Poise with the ticking clock and horizon moment, but cost legibility falters—the emotional price of acceptance isn't concretely shown in the final beat ("smiled" lacks visceral weight).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (film reel chamber) directly constrains choice during climax, while the compasses and piano charge the final image; tidal arbor’s ethereal breeze actively shapes perception without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative/Textural lens as memories accumulate, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—the reel’s magic resolves grief rather than Elara’s agency narrowing options under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the piano’s "new song" reconfiguration, avoiding moralizing; the arbor’s sigh resonates as earned wisdom without stating a moral, reweighting "surprise fate" through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "kaleidoscope of colors" sensory filtering, but "steely longing" devolves into label-speak under stress; voice lacks rhythmic compression during high-pressure reel immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("battered, still held melody") and stock phrasing ("pulsed with life") dull momentum; final line’s "arbor sighed" achieves textural specificity but earlier scaffold dilutes peak-beat density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief via film-reel memory portal feels inevitable, yet "surprise fate" motivation leans cliché; tidal arbor’s rules transform tropes through specific emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
