<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's embodied expertise shines ("fingers tracing constellations"), but "cautiously hopeful" remains a label without contradictory impulses in the climax; cosmic trickster motivation lacks concrete friction despite strong micro-choices with the subwoofer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("protests erupted"), but community division feels coincidental rather than causal escalation from her action; orientation is flawless with radio station details anchoring by line 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Radio station micro-setting constrains choice (subwoofer calibration), but sunset "ethereal glow" is generic atmosphere without reweighting the final image; sensory details like "hum of outdated equipment" perfectly filter through Elara's scientific lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (signal control) is clear, but escalation lacks causal pressure—Hank's complaint is the sole on-page tightening; community protests feel off-screen rather than narrowing options meaningfully under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "grit vs cosmic tricksters," but final line ("universe was full of mysteries") risks thematic echo; the counter-frequency's "strange peace" charges closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "spectrograph flickered" and cosmic jargon, but protest description ("protests erupted") shifts to generic third-person summary, breaking POV consistency during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts with strong propulsion ("air vibrated faintly"), but adjacent scaffold in opening: "air thick with hum... walls lined with vintage microphones" restates atmosphere without advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "alien signal" trope via radio station micro-setting and subsonic method, but "cosmic tricksters" feels derivative; the subwoofer counter-frequency is a fresh, character-rooted solution that heightens stakes.</comment>
