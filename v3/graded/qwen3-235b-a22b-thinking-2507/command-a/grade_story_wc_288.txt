<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("translate isolation into independence") and embodied emotion during orb contact, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "brittle determination" edges toward label-only feeling without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (Elena's irreversible transformation into the library's embodiment), orientation anchored by 40 words, and Accumulative/Textural lens held through sensory density shifts toward the resonant finale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tidal library's shifting shelves actively constrain navigation, and the brass sundial charges the final image, but "moss-covered stones" lack tactile specificity during critical descent beats where urgency should narrow sensory focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elena's agency as the library tests her resolve (shelves closing in, air growing heavier), culminating in the orb's irreversible integration; cost is legible in her altered physiology and role, though the "hum" escalation lacks granular pressure increments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "brittle awakenings" reframing isolation as embodied coexistence, but final line's "beacon of brittle awakenings" risks thematic echo, nearly triggering Q5 penalty for prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds swirled like a restless sea," "scent of aged parchment") modulates with emotional intensity, though "reincarnation memory" reflection slightly violates BRR by summarizing without altering immediate tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Brittle" repetition (4x) creates paraphrase loops in high-pressure beats, dulling momentum; otherwise strong propulsion and concrete verbs ("sundial clutched tightly," "shelves rearranging") anchor the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidal mechanics with knowledge preservation elevates the library beyond trope, though "twin suns" reflection risks derivative familiarity without deeper integration into the moral calculus.</comment>
