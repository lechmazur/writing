<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via scent-triggered memories, but Lila remains a symbolic memory-figure without independent agency to pressure Elias’s choices. Key micro-choice (uncorking vial) earns closure through prior sensory accumulation, though secondary character depth lacks friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "shadows soften" crystallizes emotional shift with visible cost in Elias’s release of suppressed grief. Accumulative lens holds through memory shards, each narrowing his emotional options toward uncorking the vial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crystal vial) constrains choices—his avoidance then uncorking—and charges the final image. "Crystal shadows" evolve from eerie to comforting, reweighting the shop’s atmosphere through sensory specificity tied to grief’s progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency: fear of scents (established early) tightens through memory visions until uncorking becomes the only path forward. Cost is visceral—years of emotional suppression paid in tears—with no coincidence resolving tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sensory work ("jasmine and rain" → "shadows soften"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights Lila’s hospital question into earned wisdom: smells anchor loss but also comfort, with ambiguity preserved in "indescribably familiar" scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—Elias notices light/scent obsessively ("flickering warmth," "ultraviolet glow")—and syntax compresses under memory stress ("He reached out, but his hand passed through her"). No head-hopping; tension modulates through lyrical restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "petals preserved in jars like relics" layers meaning efficiently. Minor deduction for slight overuse of "crystal" in shop descriptions, though repetition serves motif cohesion without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tropes via scent-as-memory-anchor, with "ultraviolet vial" transforming cliché. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off, though greenhouse setting leans slightly symbolic without fully pressuring choices beyond metaphor.</comment>
