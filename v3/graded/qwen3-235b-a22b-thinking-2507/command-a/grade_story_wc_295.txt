<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "profound shift" lacks embodied irrationality. "Healing herself" phrasing veers into diagnostic label-speak during pivotal realization, undermining authentic emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with felt cost ("burdens carried in silence" acknowledged), but variable stars' alignment feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Lens clarity holds post-midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting charging closure ("crucible for transformation"), but lacks tangible constraint on choices. Daylily-pressed telegram's fragility symbolizes theme without altering tactics, narrowly missing 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding inscriptions to heal) tightens through constellation revelation, but escalation relies on external star patterns rather than protagonist-driven pressure shifts. Cost ("acknowledging burdens") is legible yet internalized without concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through telegram/star motifs reweighted at closure, but "shared burdens" concept remains abstract without on-page demonstration of sharing. Final line avoids moralizing yet lacks the non-literal answer required for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars whispered secrets") and rhythmic control shine, but "heal with words" exposition breaks POV plausibility during high-pressure decoding. Elision taught early and paid off in Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("daylily-pressed telegram") but paraphrase loop in paragraph 4 ("heal with words...mending others...healing herself") dulls climax. Filter-verb stack ("letting the words...flow through her") narrowly avoids -0.5 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic observation and emotional healing avoids cliché, yet "shared burdens" trope isn't transformed through specific lived detail. Bold structural choice (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry but lacks irreplaceable emotional specificity.</comment>
