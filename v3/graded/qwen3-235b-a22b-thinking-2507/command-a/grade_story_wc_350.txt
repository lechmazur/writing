<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (tender heart/vigorous resolve) manifest in her song choice and physical trembling during performance, but Mr. Kovar’s sudden participation lacks earned causality—his silence-to-story shift feels coincidental rather than pressured by the singing’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (community rebirth requires sustained effort), but the astronomical clock’s reactivation lacks causal linkage to Elara’s specific linguistic choices; gears turning "as if responding" creates soft causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The brass cuckoo weight charges the final image (reflecting "community reborn"), and starlight’s "hush" evolves from atmospheric detail to symbol of temporal pressure—but the clock tower’s physical constraints don’t actively shape Elara’s tactics beyond providing acoustics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through vocal escalation (one language → collective hum), but the "borrowed starlight" timeframe fails to tighten decisions; dawn’s arrival feels symbolic rather than imposing concrete temporal pressure on Elara’s choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grain elevator talks reimagined as "promise" rather than moral, but Mr. Kovar’s harvest story risks thematic echo—his dialogue states the unity thesis ("saved by the town") without sufficient subtextual friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in lexicon ("interspersing languages," "bartered stories not goods") and rhythmic shifts during singing, though late-arriving Mr. Kovar’s rough voice lacks distinctive idiom against the chorus, slightly flattening dialogue texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose soars in "cobblestones whispered tales" concrete specificity, but adjacent sentences like "The night deepened... energy did not wane" create paraphrase loops; "rehabilitated more than a clock" borders on thematic boilerplate in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical clock as reconciliation symbol avoids cliché, yet "silo" metaphor is over-explained ("crumbling relationships," "silo no longer stood")—specificity anchors universals but derivative premise guardrail limits risk distinction.</comment>
