<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses in key beats; "precisely humane" trait stated but not tested under pressure. Strong embodied details (boots sinking, glass coolness) but final choice lacks visible cost tradeoff. Motivation remains abstract despite vivid setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with wind chime's return, but cost ("surge of purpose") feels conceptual not felt. Orientation solid by paragraph 1, yet stakes never viscerally threaten town's present reality. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but escalation lacks meaningful pressure shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sapphire bottle constrains choices (exhibit centerpiece) and charges final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory details vivid ("pinprick stars," damp earth) but reservoir's physical threat remains atmospheric backdrop, not tactical constraint. Micro-setting elevates beyond generic postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("amnesia") stays abstract; no tangible consequence if Elias fails. Agency passive—follows clues rather than makes hard choices. Band guardrail fails: no visible price altering tactics, despite "surge of purpose" pseudo-cost. Pressure accumulates without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing but "resurfacing" concept remains literal; final stars reflection doesn't reweight prior material. "Expunge amnesia" borders on thematic echo. Emotional aftereffect resonant yet unrealistically swift—no lingering complexity in town's healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical control evident in water/earth imagery ("mirrored hush," "pinholes in dark cloth"). Perceptual signature strong but Elias' internal voice lacks distinction—thoughts read as authorial commentary. "Precisely humane" feels imposed, not organically revealed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but middle-section density suffers: "vivid color...vivid memory" repetition, "mirrored hush" overuse. Final paragraph's "beacon, promise...smiled" cadence feels mechanical. Strong propulsion otherwise, with concrete verbs ("sank," "prick," "resurface").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Transforms flood-memory trope through specific objects (liqueur label), but "town rediscovering history" remains familiar. Emotional truth in Elias' quiet role elevates it, yet safety-middle in conflict resolution—no genuine risk to healing process. Freshness in bottle's origin but derivative emotional arc.</comment>
