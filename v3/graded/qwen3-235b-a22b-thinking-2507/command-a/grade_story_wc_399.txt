<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ache with knowledge of change" vs "solace in echo") and embodied micro-choices (mask adjustment, kneeling ritual) strong, but "strangely honest" trait lacks on-page tradeoff under pressure—no cost when consecrating. Prophet interaction misses status dynamics depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: footprints erased but actions endure, with conceptual cost (impermanence vs legacy). Orientation clear by para 1. Minor escalation flaw—consecration ritual lacks deepening beyond single beat, barely meeting "one meaningful tightening" threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (kneeling ritual) and charges final image ("would endure"). Whisperfield calm modulates with pressure (growing hum). Dunes underutilized as tactical constraint—sand imprints remain thematic rather than altering moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wisdom against change) signaled early. Agency clear in consecration, but cost remains abstract—no concrete tradeoff during ritual (e.g., physical strain, time pressure). Prophet's "imminent" arrival doesn't tighten tactics, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (legacy vs impermanence) emerges organically from "erased footprints/enduring actions" contrast. Final image reweights "whisperfield calm" with resonance. Weak integration of "strangely honest" trait—stated but not woven into thematic calculus, missing one elevating feature for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peripheral awareness," "strangely honest nature") and rhythmic control evident. Filter verbs cluster during high-pressure consecration ("she knew," "she felt"), dulling immediacy where tension peaks. No POV leakage—interiority consistently calibrated to stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density ("silken walls rippled with faint hum of voices long since faded") and clean final image. Paraphrase loop in para 3: three lines stating tension ("breath steady," "strange authority," "air thickened") without progression during critical ritual beat, muddling pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Kinetic parapet" as living artifact transforms consecration trope with freshness. Prophet archetype lacks inflection—arrival feels ceremonial rather than consequential. Emotional specificity in "ache with knowledge of change" avoids templates, but missing one bold risk for 9+.</comment>
