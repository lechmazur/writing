<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghostwriter identity remains thematic backdrop rather than shaping decisions; "keeper of secrets" label lacks causal pressure despite strong embodied emotion in placement choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with legible cost (surrendering the spiral), but the groove's "perfect" fit introduces coincidental convenience that slightly undermines agency under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thrush's nest twig functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax choice and charges the final image ("silent offering"), elevating specificity beyond atmospheric description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through knowledge reconfiguration (revealed connections), but the emotional cost of losing the talisman feels underweighted against the quest's magnitude in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the spiral's journey, with the final image ("thread... was real, and she had touched it") offering resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in noticing dragonfly/sunlight patterns, though "keeper of secrets" phrasing momentarily lapses into thematic labeling under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in "keeper of secrets" repetitions slightly dulls closure impact; otherwise strong propulsion and sensory precision anchor the lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriter's craft with cosmic seeking avoids abstraction, but "thread connecting all things" premise lacks sufficient transformation from familiar spiritual tropes.</comment>
