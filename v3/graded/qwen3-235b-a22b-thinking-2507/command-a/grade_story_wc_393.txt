<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses (doubt vs duty) act in scene; the final resolve earns cost through prior causality. Alistair’s wisdom feels earned, though his backstory lacks friction. Micro-choices like cradling the heart reveal value hierarchy with visible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes Elias’s stance with undeniable pressure ("the storm was coming"), but cost (professional risk, emotional toll) remains implied rather than dramatized on-page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density increase in workshop beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Antique shop setting constrains choice: music boxes mirror Thomas’s trapped hope, and the clockwork heart’s repair directly charges the final image. Sensory details (aged wood, ticking rhythm) reflect Elias’s urgency without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (Elias’s credibility, Thomas’s freedom) tighten via Alistair’s dialogue ("sometimes the most broken things reveal the most truth"), but the cost of Elias’s action isn’t viscerally shown—only resolved through internal shift, missing tangible consequence on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects: repaired heart reweights "brokenness" as truth-revealing, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("Elias felt ready to face it") offers non-literal answer to "deserve" without stating a moral, leveraging mechanical metaphor organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices music boxes as "frozen stories"), rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "aptly deliberate" slightly jars, but compression in workshop dialogue serves subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("melodies trapped in silence until Alistair’s hands set them free" ties setting to theme), but "calm before realization settled over him like a cloak" edges toward scaffold. No closure-impacting loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical repair as emotional/legal truth-seeking; transforms "wise mentor" trope via specific music-box metaphors. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "vibrant hush" borders cliché without full transformation.</comment>
