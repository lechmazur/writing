<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (scientific rigor vs. poetic interpretation) shown through micro-choices like deliberate dust mapping, but "strip needless drama" motivation remains abstractly stated without embodied friction during key experiments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("butterfly was more than a creature"), but dust mechanics lack causal precision; "preprocesses reality" functions thematically rather than constraining action under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices (damp soil for dust experiments, broken glass affecting light patterns), with recurring dust object charging the final image; "thin fabric barely insulating" exemplifies purpose-driven sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning in decay) tightens via dust's responsiveness, but escalation lacks visible price during buildup; cost remains conceptual at closure ("strip away needless drama") without tactical sacrifice shown on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through dust patterns and decay, avoiding moralizing; final butterfly image reweights "gradual change" non-literally, though "symbol of resilience" risks slight thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shimmering faintly," "skeletal frame") modulates with emotional intensity, but "preprocesses reality" creates minor register drift from character-plausible lexicon during high-pressure observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion, but paraphrase loop ("decay of the space mirrored the decay she studied... gradual transformation") and three "She had begun to..." sentences trigger template-cadence deduction in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron star physics with terrestrial decay transforms magical realism tropes, though butterfly reconstitution risks familiarity; specificity of "brackish water" and "imperceptible ways" anchors universals.</comment>
