<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on embodied action (smudged hands, frayed knot) but "heart ached" is label-only emotion; contradictory impulses absent despite high stakes—Lira’s resolve lacks internal friction beyond stated motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (beacon walls, smoldering knot) with conceptual cost, but the cost isn’t unmistakable on the page; "we rise" lacks earned tension as the sole micro-turn preceding victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot constrains choices (spinning/flames) and charges the final image (smoldering beacon), while blooming fortress flora evolves causally with the mosaic—environment actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through density (chants→chorus, petals→mosaic) under Accumulative lens, but pressure lacks visible cost: Lira’s success feels unearned as despair dissolves without tangible sacrifice beyond abstract "battle far from over."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mosaic’s transformation (wilting → rising sun), avoiding moralizing; yet "dawn would come" borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice distinctively filters urgency through tactile details ("frayed edges glinting," "dirt-smudged hands"), though "heart ached" momentarily slips into generic interiority without character-particular sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Chants returned, louder now" exhibits template cadence; minor scaffold in "carefully placed, forming the shape" slightly dulls propulsion, but rhythmic control during fire-spinning ("flames burst to life") elevates peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "serious playfulness" with firework design avoids tropes, yet safety-hedging prevails—no genuine risk (e.g., failed ignition) to deepen stakes, muting emotional complexity.</comment>
