<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; epiphany ("greatest journeys within") unearned by specific struggle. "Weathered resolve" stated but not embodied through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost in closure forecloses path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis fails cost proof test: canyon's "sigh" is atmospheric, not legible cost. Accumulative lens holds, but stakes remain abstract without dramatized consequence. No tightening forecloses options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Towers of bone" micro-setting charges final image (Kael blending into shadows). Sensory detail selective and urgent during bird flight. Environment constrains choice only implicitly via stillness requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("appraise arrowhead") never viscerally tested; bird patterns resolve smoothly without struggle. Agency passive (observation), no trade-offs. Pressure lacks deepening—no visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme ("stillness within motion") emerges organically but final paragraph commits Thematic Echo: "not movement, but stillness; not answers, but the questions" states thesis explicitly, triggering -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pulse left wandering") with rhythmic control during bird observation. No head-hopping. Minor register drift in climax ("heart swelled with understanding" edges toward abstraction).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density but final paragraph suffers paraphrase loop: "not movement... not answers" repeats thematic abstraction. No figurative muddle, but redundancy dulls closure charge. Momentum loss in reflection-heavy climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Harmonic stone skimmer" transforms mystic trope through specific bird-pattern mechanics. Emotional truth in stillness quest, but "navigate without moving" lacks fresh inflection beyond established lyric tradition.</comment>
