<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via accordion patches labeled with dates/memories, embodying mending without therapy-speak. Final choice to trace her map earns self-forgiveness pursuit through micro-choices like the mournful note. Slight deduction for the man’s convenient wisdom not deepening her internal conflict enough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "began to trace the lines" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("raw solace" shifting weight). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density tightening stakes. Minor deduction as the man’s appearance edges toward coincidence without deepening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accordion bellows constrains choice (map vessel) and charges closure ("felt lighter"). Vivid specificity in "boots crunching on broken glass" filters through river chronicler’s tactile POV. Slight overwriting in "cathedral of decay" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening: "raw ache of unfiltered memory" narrows options to facing her past. Conceptual cost legible in "weight on her chest shifted." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but no tangible loss shown beyond emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "The river knows" reweighted into personal truth; final tracing act answers forgiveness-as-journey without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "raw solace" phrasing. Resonant closure via charged object (accordion) reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "ivied silence" and tape patches like river currents. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity ("single, mournful note"). Dialogue subtext ("Still playing the same tune?") avoids naturalism flaws but slightly over-polished.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "rusted tracks gleezing" avoids scaffold. Minor overwriting in "cathedral of decay" and one synonym loop ("recklessness and precision"/"daringly methodical") in peak beats. Final line’s "first steps" avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: river chronicler using accordion as map vessel transforms self-forgiveness tropes. Specificity in patch-labeled dates avoids generality. Risk-taking in quiet closure lands through prior particulars, though bathroom graffiti wisdom leans tropey.</comment>
