<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs spiritual curiosity) act simultaneously when abandoning cleaning to follow coordinates; final renunciation of lantern’s physical presence earned by embodied realization of "flourishing stillness" with conceptual cost ("strength passed to her").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: lantern dimming crystallizes reconfigured options (her internal stillness sustains her) with undeniable conceptual cost ("strength passed to her"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through density buildup to final star affirmation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (guiding coordinates, merging light with constellation) and charges closure (dimming on shelf), with sensory details like "hummed with ancient machinery" reflecting professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through Accumulative lens via lantern’s intensifying glow and constellation alignment, narrowing options to empathetic surrender; cost legible in "strength passed to her" as conceptual price for internal stillness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (cleaning as "meditation on vulnerability"), avoiding moralizing; final shooting star offers non-literal answer to spiritual seeking without stated moral, resisting tidy binaries through "paradoxical truth" of surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal frame etched against infinite void") modulates rhythm under pressure; Accumulative pattern taught early (lantern’s pulse with heartbeat) and paid off in closure’s crystallized stillness without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("patchwork of shimmering fabrics, bore the stains of countless spills" conveys character, history, theme); final line recharges "primal elegance" motif without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor trope transformed through specific verisimilitude (maintenance as "nurturing stillness"), but "flourishing stillness" concept slightly echoes familiar spiritual tropes without sufficiently fresh inflection beyond setting.</comment>
