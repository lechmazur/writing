<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; "whimsical tinkerer" archetype overshadows specific flaws. Embodied emotion strong but final choice lacks irrationality or trade-off cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost ("work far from over"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Hybrid) past midpoint weakens causality. Cost proof insufficiently visualized beyond abstract statement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arbor functions as micro-setting charging closure via dew/vine light, but environment doesn’t constrain choices. "Golden threads" specificity elevates though tool use lacks tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring practices) tightens via singing climax, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the vine/moon resolves conflict coincidentally. Moral calculus absent in peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vine orb imagery avoiding moralizing, but "spin stories of hope" borders on thematic echo. Final image reweights land-healing concept without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears, glowing liquids") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor lexicon drift ("sacred practices" too abstract) but compression pays off in closure’s tactile warmth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("liquid gold," "dew sparkled like stars") but overwriting in climax: "golden threads... intricate patterns" dilutes momentum. No closure-touched artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer archetype with botanical magic, but "harvest moon stories" trope lacks transformation. Emotional specificity in dawn’s "gathering hush" elevates beyond template.</comment>
