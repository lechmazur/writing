<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "withheld truth" motivation is clear but childhood trauma remains abstract. Final acceptance of guardianship lacks visceral cost beyond metaphorical "weight settling," weakening earned change. Strong embodied action (kneeling for shard) partially compensates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost—"weight of responsibility" crystallizes when repair bay transforms into nexus. Causal lens holds cleanly (shard discovery → transport → orb merger), but cost proof is slightly abstract; no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond the orb's glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned repair bay’s rust/grease sensory details anchor early tension, but setting doesn’t constrain choices until the ending (nexus revelation). Micro-setting (green shard) charges closure via orb merger, yet alien forest lacks causal pressure—smells/sounds noted but unused in decision-making.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth discovery) tightens through shard transport → doppelgänger encounter → orb merger. Agency-driven escalation excels, but cost remains conceptual ("heavier than you imagine") without tangible forfeiture; the responsibility burden lacks on-page trade-offs beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges through shards/maps without moralizing. Final image ("stepped forward, ready to weave") reweights "withheld truth" as guardianship duty, but doppelgänger’s line "heavier than you imagine" edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensory maps," rust/grease specificity) shines under pressure. Rhythm modulates effectively (shorter sentences during transport), but "murmur of half-remembered dreams" opener feels overfamiliar, diluting voice novelty in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "air thickening like a curtain" avoids purple prose. Minor overwriting in "symphony of whispers and rustles that seemed to call her name" slightly dulls momentum, but final line’s active verbs ("weave," "protect," "uncover") rescue propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory map maker angle transforms multiverse tropes, yet "guardian of the weave" resolution feels derivative. Fresh inflection in "cyclically spontaneous" shard detail, but conceptual integrity wavers—childhood trauma motivation lacks payoff, reducing emotional specificity.</comment>
