<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; shift from curiosity to preservation lacks struggle. "Compelled to preserve" tells rather than shows earned change through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost remains conceptual. No on-page sentence/image makes the price legible—community healing happens off-scene, violating cost proof test for tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oasis micro-setting constrains choices: sun patterns guide actions, crumbling hives shape pottery forms. Final image of "thrumming" glass charging the healed oasis perfectly meets 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sun-pattern alignment, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost. Fractured timelines tighten knowledge without Elara paying visible price—community action resolves loss without her personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment>Theme emerges through particulars (lantern’s kindness-phototropism), but "beacon of kindness" realization edges toward thematic echo. Final image reweights prior material without stating morals, though cost remains abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light danced through broken hives") with rhythmic control. No POV slippage, but "sharp gentleness" cliché slightly flattens voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thrum repetition ("thrummed softly," "grew louder," "thrummed louder") creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats. Otherwise vivid, purposeful prose with strong textural specificity anchoring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and kindness-as-continuity. "Phototropic to kindness" transforms familiar magic realism tropes through specific beekeeping oasis logic and earned emotional charge.</comment>
