<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong motivation drives action but internal contradiction lacks embodiment; "icy warmth" stated not shown through micro-choices during crisis. Micro-turn at lever-pull lacks value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal closure holds with Earned Stasis (proof achieved but station destabilized), but cost proof lacks specificity; "at what cost?" stated rather than dramatized through concrete consequence like colleague backlash.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nexus functions as micro-setting charging final image, but winged creatures remain atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices; station details generic despite bioluminescent integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early with one tightening (lever-pull → system failure), but escalation diminishes protagonist agency post-inciting incident; cost visible in system failures but emotional price remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through temporal anomaly data, but final paragraph's "motivation tempered by responsibility" states lesson rather than showing cost through particulars; avoids moralizing penalty by not being final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct "sky mechanic" lexicon evident early, but degrades under stress with abstract labels ("subdued awakenings"); holographic interface descriptions feel generic rather than character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Critical filter-verb stacks in climax ("her hands flying," "mind racing") dull immediacy; "icy warmth" repeated as therapy-speak label without embodiment; template cadence undermines pressure in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Time moves sideways" offers fresh physics angle, but emotional resolution safety-hedges with generic "ready to face whatever"; winged creatures feel like untransformed alien ambiance trope.</comment>
