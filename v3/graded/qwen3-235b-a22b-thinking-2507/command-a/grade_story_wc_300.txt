<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; transition from inspector to "bridge" lacks visible struggle. "She was not just an inspector but a bridge" uses diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost, triggering -0.5 penalty. Micro-choices under pressure show no hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity past midpoint (Causal vs. Accumulative) caps score. Cost proof fails: "steady resolve" lacks legible price; no felt consequence for ignoring inspection timeframe. Orientation test passed but closure (Earned Stasis) feels unearned due to shallow causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details but crystal caves function as postcard backdrop, not constraint. No environmental pressure on choices (e.g., light/terrain never impedes movement). Final image's "whispering walls" lacks charge from prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract: "tight timeframe" declared but never tested—she abandons duty effortlessly. No visible cost for following pearl; escalation relies on mystical pull rather than protagonist agency. Dominant stake (unity) lacks tangible opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes: "she had been chosen to crown their collective hope" states theme outright. "The crown was not just a symbol; it was a catalyst" exemplifies Thematic Echo (-0.8 penalty). Complexity collapses into simplistic unity trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uniform poetic diction ("resonant hush," "latent radiance") lacks character-specific perceptual signature. Under stress (chamber scene), syntax remains equally ornate—no compression or rhythm shift. Voice modulates only through lexical repetition, not emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Severe overwriting: 80% of high-pressure chamber beat uses stacked metaphors ("mosaic of crystals refracted light into a thousand colors"). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she sensed") dull immediacy. Template cadence ("As she..., the...") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Derivative mystical-chosen-one framework; pearl/crown mechanics feel templated. No fresh inflection—transformations (inspector to bridge) lack grounded specificity. "Cultivated pearl" as hope-vessel is a stock fantasy trope without meaningful reinvention.</comment>
