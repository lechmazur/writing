<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to honor overlooked histories drives concrete micro-choices (unfastening painting, tracing murals) with embodied emotion, though "heart anchored" edges toward abstraction. Contradictory impulses (personal loss vs. communal duty) manifest in tactile actions under pressure without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: fragment's purpose fulfilled with visible cost (emotional weight of histories made tangible), under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors market/platform by 80 words; lens inferred by midpoint with consistent density escalation toward resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lens fragment constrains every choice—from market discovery to tower navigation—and charges the final image (fading glow). Sensory details (copper/sage, ivy doorway) evolve with urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome while mirroring internal stakes through lived-in tool use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering histories) tightens meaningfully via map discovery, narrowing options to tower journey. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds, but cost remains conceptual (untold stories' weight) without visceral on-page forfeiture beyond emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lens fragment's evolution from relic to bridge, rejecting tidy morals for "resilience of intuition." Final image (fragment fading as city awakes) reweights premise without stating moral, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity of memory's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (translating "elusively tangible" details) modulates rhythm under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early ("symphony of whispers") pays off in closure; no head-hopping despite reflective backstory seamlessly anchored by physical cues (lens fragment).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density in peak beats (tower discovery). Minor overwriting risk ("murmurs of the overlooked") avoided by concrete verbs ("pulsed," "traced"), though "eternal instant" phrasing slightly drifts register in high-stakes moments without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes "translator" trope with tangible artifact-driven stakes through specific world logic (lens as key). Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off via charged final image, avoiding derivative middle-ground choices while resisting safety-hedging on moral ambiguity.</comment>
