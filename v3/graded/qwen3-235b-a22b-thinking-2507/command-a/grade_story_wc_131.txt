<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for visibility is clear but under-dramatized; actions show kindness but lack contradictory impulses during pivotal cache discovery. "Weight of cached memories begin to lift" feels abstract rather than embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (visibility redefined as being heard), but the "weight begin to lift" phrasing obscures tangible price. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sapphire hush and pipe chases constrain choices (e.g., "air grew colder as they descended"), charging the final image where shadows retreat. Micro-setting functions as environment when "aged carpet" grounds movement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming visible) tightens through cache discovery, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure shifts. Pipe chase descent deepens atmosphere without altering tactics, missing visceral cost legibility at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tape fragments redefining visibility as connection, avoiding moralizing. Final line "to matter" slightly abstracts the cost, preventing full resonance despite strong particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic pull") sustains Accumulative lens. Voice modulates effectively under pressure—e.g., "fingers brushing walls" shows tactile focus during tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("methodical" x4 in key beats) and "weight of story half-forgotten" synonym churn. No closure artifacts, but "kindly heart full" edges toward therapy-speak in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crawl space dweller + analog media avoids trope through specific "ferromagnetic" detail. Resolution hedges risk with "smiled, kindly heart full" rather than confronting invisibility's enduring cost.</comment>
