<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Eli's manual spellcasting solace vs. history of failure; harness choice reveals prioritization of heart over efficiency under pressure. Epiphany avoids diagnostic labels by tying to physical sensation ("surge of energy"), though motivation depth for "sacred in simple" could strengthen stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: spire's walls halting after harness use crystallizes options with visible cost (panic, trembling hands). Causal linkage holds through harness deployment; persistent constraint of manual skill shapes climax tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Icebound spire actively constrains choices: closing walls raise stakes, harness anchors to ice outcropping enabling climax. Lingering luminance evolves from dimming (resisting Eli) to brightening (awakened), charging final image per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Eli's agency: trap narrows options to harness use or death, raising stakes from abstract quest to survival. Cost unmistakable in physical panic and thematic weight of manual method succeeding where automation failed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: keystone's redefined power ("sacred in simplest acts") arises from harness success, not moralizing. Final image ("brilliance dimness... simplest of places") reweights "impossible geometry" into earned resonance without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in tactile details ("breath crystallized," "shifting patterns") filtered through failing mage's perspective. Rhythmic compression during trap ("Panic surged... trembling hands") heightens pressure, though "brilliance dimness" phrase slightly overwrought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, but mid-beat scaffold ("His motivation was clear...") tells where showing would strengthen. "Brilliance dimness" repetition risks muddle, though final line achieves textural specificity without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "underdog mage" trope via automated spell looms and mist walking's manual failure. Emotional truth in quest for craft validation, though "garden folly" concept lacks full integration with spire's logic.</comment>
