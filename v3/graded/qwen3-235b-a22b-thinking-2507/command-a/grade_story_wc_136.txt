<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in analytical/artistic duality driving punch decision; "trembling certainty" slightly overused but earned by micro-choices like hesitating at ticket. Emotional embodiment strong except near-climax "breath caught" cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with legible cost ("something within her had shifted"); Accumulative lens holds through arrow path and mirror labyrinth. Minor flaw: fortress arrival lacks causal pressure buildup despite strong midnight timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Phantom punch (tool) constrains choices and charges final image; mist-shrouded woods pressure decisions via whispered branches. Fortress description slightly generic ("shimmered like starlight") dilutes micro-setting potential despite strong early vault anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake crystallizes as confronting inner mysteries to unravel external ones; midnight timing tightens decisions visibly. Cost is clear in "no longer feared the mysteries" shift, though arrow path escalation leans slightly convenient under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final line ("greatest maps... with courage") reweights premise non-literally without moralizing; theme emerges from punch/ticket mechanics. Avoids anti-patterns: no thematic echo, wisdom earned through fortress mirrors' concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong via mapper's analytical framing ("cracks formed arrows, too deliberate to be random"); rhythm modulates from precise to lyrical. Minor register drift in fortress description ("defied explanation") slightly jars established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>No closure artifacts but "trembling certainty" repetition (3x) creates subtle synonym loop; "heart raced... breath caught" adjacent clichés slightly dull momentum. Final image propulsion strong despite minor scaffolding in woods sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping profession with mystery archetype; "fortress of unspoken truths" transformed through character-specific mirror reflections. Risk-taking in conceptual closure pays off, though arrow motif lacks sufficient grounding in prior details.</comment>
