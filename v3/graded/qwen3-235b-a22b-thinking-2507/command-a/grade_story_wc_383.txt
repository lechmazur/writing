<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s skepticism-isolation tension, embodied through shell hesitation and resisting memories. Micro-choice to "not resist" the flood earns her transformation, though figure’s dialogue slightly over-articulates the thematic shift without sufficient internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: Elara’s walk away forecloses skepticism with visible cost (absorbed orchid radiance, silent shell). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density tightens into tapestry vision—while the "last star fading" crystallizes the cost without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting that charges closure: velvet petals dissolving into light-sea during transformation, then whispering gratitude as breeze. Orchid’s glow dimming directly mirrors Elara’s internal shift, constraining her choices from skepticism to archivist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory preservation vs. isolation) tightens when Elara stops resisting the flood, narrowing options to transformation. Cost is legible in the orchid’s dimmed radiance, though the figure’s exposition slightly softens the pressure escalation before the pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—tears becoming rivers, solitude a lighthouse—but the figure’s line "turn that strength into independence" borders on thematic echo, risking didacticism despite otherwise earned resonance in the final tapestry image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature is distinct: jasmine scent and shifting orchid hues filter through Elara’s skeptical lens, with rhythmic compression ("The garden blurred... dissolving into sea of light") under peak stress. Voice modulates flawlessly from detached observation to visceral transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "velvet garden" and "tragically radiant" recur with charged specificity. Minor deduction for "heart raced" (label-only feeling) in high-pressure beat, but propulsion remains relentless through strong verbs ("dissolving," "weaving," "fading").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-archiving via sensory objects (orchid, shell) avoids trope pitfalls. Emotional specificity in "quarantined memories" elevates the premise, though the "lighthouse" metaphor edges toward familiar territory without sufficient reinvention.</comment>
