<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown in climax; final bargain lacks causal buildup. Strength: Professionally specific "carefully resourceful" trait demonstrated in trap navigation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost ("weight of discovery"), but guardian resolution lacks causal linkage. Strength: Clear orientation and causal chain until climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Chrono-blossom constrains choice (must bloom at specific time) AND charges closure via mountain's "whispered approval." Weakness: Chamber spatial choreography vague during garden shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through physical obstacles, but time collapse urgency never tests Elara's values. Cost remains abstract despite "weight" line; no tangible forfeiture alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme ("knowledge as burden") emerges through "unlearned wisdom" motif without moralizing. Weakness: "it came with a price" borders on thematic echo, slightly diluting subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("script only she could read") and rhythmic control under pressure ("She approached it cautiously"). No filter-verb overuse or POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("She recognized... She approached... She plucked") and mixed metaphor in closure ("weight of unlearned wisdom, a symphony"). Strength: Lyrical precision in botanical descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "library of unlearned lessons" transforms quest tropes. Risk-taking in conceptual closure (Earned Stasis) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
