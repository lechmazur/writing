<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "sharply observant" trait drives key choices (noticing still air, reassembling letters), but emotional contradiction remains surface-level; diagnostic repetition of "sharply observant" slightly undermines embodiment despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with visible cost (returning dust storms), but the thumb-press triggering message shift relies on coincidence rather than causal escalation, weakening the climax's agency under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (dull stone) and constrains choices (pressing it alters reality), though sensory specificity beyond visual could deepen the orchard's atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten effectively toward containment, but the "ancient danger" lacks visceral threat escalation; pressure narrows options credibly, yet conceptual cost outweighs felt personal sacrifice beyond fatigue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth's burden emerges organically through the final image (dull diamond, returning storms), avoiding moralizing, but lacks layered ambiguity—comfortable lies versus vigilance presents limited counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory details (ashen soil, faint hum), though repetitive "sharply observant" phrasing slightly dilutes voice coherence during high-stress beats like the shadow confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("resonate with the diamond"/"pulse intensified") and filter-verb clusters ("felt a faint hum," "realized the truth") reduce propulsion in the climax, though rhythm remains controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "flawed diamond as seal" elevates the trope, but the liquidation backstory feels generically apocalyptic; emotional specificity in Elara's vigilance commitment lifts it beyond template execution.</comment>
