<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines ("ache in her chest"), but Elara’s "piece of herself" realization lacks prior setup, slightly undermining motivation for her personal stake despite strong micro-choices like the single-note prompt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with felt cost ("tooth falling... power spent"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density; minor escalation quibble as pressure builds steadily without a distinct intensification beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Echo Gorge’s acoustics and the harp (micro-setting) constrain choices and charge the final image (strings aligned, laughter echoes), satisfying 9+ gate despite lyrical vagueness in spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Elara’s agency (harp intensifying) reweights the stake with visible cost, but conflict lacks resistance—the figure never opposes her, preventing the tightening needed for 8.8+ band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the boy’s memory and spent tooth, offering a resonant non-literal answer ("light in darkness") without moralizing; early "integrate laughter" avoids Thematic Echo by being dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous ache," harp’s "distorted notes") and rhythmic control under pressure; dialogue carries subtext ("I’m here to listen"), with no head-hopping despite single-POV lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, high density ("spectral confession taking shape as a memory"), and no figurative muddle; "hidden sunrise" phrasing risks vagueness but avoids harming closure’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of soul collector + sorrow-tuned harp feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional specificity edges toward archetypal grief.</comment>
