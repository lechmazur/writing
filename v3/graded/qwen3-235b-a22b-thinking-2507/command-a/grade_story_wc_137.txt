<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; transformation from skeptic to believer occurs without embodied struggle or visible cost (e.g., no hesitation transcribing the tile). Interior void named but not anchored in specific micro-choices that reveal competing values during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: Charged Poise achieved but no forfeiture or consequence (e.g., villagers' skepticism unchanged, no personal sacrifice). Lens ambiguity between Situational (migration timing) and Accumulative weakens escalation; midpoint fails to commit to one drive method for pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shore/tower settings vivid but fail micro-setting test: whale migration timing doesn't constrain choices, tower's ivy staircase described but doesn't impede climb. Tile as recurring object doesn't charge final image—no constraint when transcribing or placement (e.g., no struggle with materials or physical toll).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (filling void) signaled early but pressure never escalates meaningfully; tile's "urge" faces no resistance. Whale migration timeframe is decorative rather than live clock (no "tide rising" urgency). Climax lacks trade-off—gains connection without visible cost scaling to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars but final paragraph moralizes ("bridge between skepticism and wonder"), violating earned resonance. "Contribute to the symphony of the universe" borders on pseudo-profundity; avoids Thematic Echo penalty only by not being in last line but still states thesis overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("whispering sea," star-chart lens) but stress responses lack specificity ("intrigued yet uneasy" then immediate acceptance). Rhythmic control weakens during climax—long sentences when urgency should compress syntax, missing opportunity for diction modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor metaphor inconsistency ("unheard symphony" shifts from "faint melody" to "louder" without physical logic) and "entangled memories" as jargon. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies effectively but final line "listened to the unheard symphony" contradicts established term, dulling closure resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh magic square tile concept undermined by generic whale-star migration trope. Emotional truth strong but lacks verifiable specificity (e.g., real whale species or constellation patterns). Transformation test fails—swap "whales" for "birds" and arc remains identical, indicating insufficient grounding.</comment>
