<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "voice stolen by memories" versus singing climax; embodied emotion via calloused hands and fragment's warmth avoids abstraction. Slight abstraction in backstory ("weight of memories") prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "silence was not an end, but a beginning" crystallizes the transformation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory accumulation (bells, mist, warmth) deepens stakes without causal breaks. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned train constrains every choice: wind bells guide movement, carousel's "quiet longing" charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("calloused hands," "creaking floorboards") evolves with urgency, avoiding cliché. Micro-setting (halo fragment's warmth) directly shapes the singing decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as void vs possibility) tightens through Accumulative pressure: fragment's warmth and bells' chime narrow options toward singing. Cost is legible in reclaimed voice after "stolen" silence. Agency-driven deepening avoids coincidence; one intensification suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: carving hope into stillness, singing to awaken wood. Final image ("whispering gleam of hope") reweights silence without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character articulates the thesis, letting particulars resonate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is tactile and carpenter-specific: "fingers brushing wooden horses," "rustle of leaves" over visual clichés. Rhythm modulates perfectly—whispered melody to "stronger" song—under pressure. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via mist and bells.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issue: "faint echo of laughter long since faded" and "faded murals" create subtle synonym loop. Otherwise exemplary propulsion—"pocketed the fragment, its warmth seeping" merges action/image. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line recharges "whispering gleam" with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope through carpenter's tactile world: halo fragment recharges as carving tool, not deus ex machina. Emotional specificity ("quiet longing" in carousel eyes) avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
