<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("grips reality loosely" vs seeking solace) lacks concrete manifestation under pressure; man's question triggers reflection but no micro-choice altering tactics. Parasol handling shows embodied emotion, yet euthanasia tourist motivation remains observational rather than decisional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: ice whisper shifting from threat to lullaby crystallizes acceptance with felt cost (her lifted weight). Orientation anchors at 78 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina evokes potent atmosphere but fails micro-setting gate: ice textures and parasol don't constrain choices (e.g., fog obscures but doesn't alter Mara's approach). Sensory specificity strong yet environment remains backdrop rather than tactical pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("sound of endings") deepens through survivor stories but lacks protagonist agency escalation. Man's question intensifies thematic pressure, yet Elara's passive listening forecloses no path with visible trade-off; cost remains internal without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "fleeting beauty" theme emerges organically through parasol's evolution from relic to symbol. Final lullaby image reweights impermanence as peace without stating moral, though euthanasia tourist framing risks over-familiarity without deeper complication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (obsessive ice textures, parasol as emotional barometer) shines, but "grips reality loosely" repetition creates voice leakage. Tense/stage stability flawless; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in northern lights closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Fold in patience" appears verbatim three times with identical phrasing—synonym churn in peak beats triggering -0.4 artifact penalty. Otherwise strong density; "windborne solace" reprise slightly redundant but saved by final image charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist premise transformed through specific observational focus (not seeking death but studying endings' "sound"). Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off; marina setting avoids disaster clichés via "broken teeth" ice and lace parasol contrast. Avoids safety middle through moral ambiguity of her detachment.</comment>
