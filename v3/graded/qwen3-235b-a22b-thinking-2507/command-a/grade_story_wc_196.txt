<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete archivist details (dust patterns, frayed folders) avoids therapy-speak; "tactfully hopeful" manifests through micro-choices like gentle brushing of the button. Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure—her hope faces no meaningful resistance, weakening the Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns and object recurrence tighten the dominant stake (finding meaning in forgotten histories). Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with felt cost—"mend her own brokenness" crystallizes her emotional trade-off. Missing a sharper pressure point before resolution; cost remains abstract despite "heart lighter" physicality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (brushing reveals clues) and charges the final image ("dust seemed to shimmer"). File room transforms from "sorrow" to "sanctuary" through tactile details like "frayed edges" and "tarnished object," avoiding white-room syndrome. Sensory specificity elevates closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering humanity in bureaucracy) tightens via button/ribbon discovery, but pressure lacks escalation—no obstacle tests her resolve. The "method" arrives late without prior struggle, muting the cost. Agency feels passive; coincidence (dust footprints) complicates but doesn’t raise stakes meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the button’s scratches reweight "forgotten promises" into tangible hope. Avoids moralizing; final image ("dust shimmer") offers non-literal answer to "brokenness." Loses points for near-symmetry—Elara’s healing mirrors Liam’s story too neatly, reducing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist’s eye for dust patterns and tactile details ("fingers trembled") shapes voice. Rhythmic control under pressure ("scratches became clearer") avoids uniformity. No dialogue, but interiority modulates effectively from sorrow to purpose without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("fractured years ago" compresses backstory). "Dust seemed to shimmer, as if approving" risks sentimentality but avoids overwriting via concrete context. Final line’s cadence ("found her purpose... lives they represented") propels closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms foster-care trope through archivist lens and dust-pattern method. Specificity ("L. Hayes, 7th Infantry") grounds universality; emotional truth in "kinship with Liam" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (textural escalation over plot) heightens stakes but lacks a bold structural pivot for 9.0+.</comment>
