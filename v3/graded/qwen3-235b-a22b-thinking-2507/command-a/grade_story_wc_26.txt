<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's embodied motivation ("preserve the shape of hope") drives choices, but internal contradiction lacks depth; the river stone grounds emotion yet "luminous regret" risks label-speak in peak beats without sufficient embodied cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the river stone's placement crystallizes irreversible change with conceptual cost ("what had been lost, and of what could still be saved"), perfectly executing Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blooming library's atmosphere constrains choice (river stone's grounding function in thick air), but micro-setting potential is underutilized; blooms' sighing glow charges the final image yet lacks causal pressure during key decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency (comparing footage, metamorphosing shadow), but opposition remains passive (colleagues' dismissal); cost feels earned yet lacks tangible tactical consequence—no live option foreclosed beyond personal epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shadow-as-forgotten-dreams metaphor, but "luminous regret" borders on thematic echo; final image reweights loss/hope without moralizing, yet secondary "resilience of human spirit" phrasing slightly overstates the earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" observations, with rhythmic control tightening during shadow manifestation; no POV drift, though "softly deliberate" repetition slightly dilutes lexical precision under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dense propulsion falters in final paragraph with "luminous regret" repetition and "resilience of human spirit" abstraction; otherwise, crystalline imagery avoids loops, but two adjacent "she realized"/"she had not just" lines trigger minor paraphrase penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work as emotional archaeology elevates tropes; "shadow unbound" transforms from glitch to collective memory vessel through specific, character-rooted choices, avoiding derivative fantasy conventions.</comment>
