<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (clinging to echoes vs seeking new sound) is embodied in chalk/driftwood actions, but "tidal longing" phrasing leans abstract. Final renunciation of chalk earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-thickening-to-lifting cadence shift reweights time's sound with conceptual cost (chalk's uselessness). Minor pressure slack in middle beats prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog actively constrains navigation; chalk's transformation (tool→relic) charges closure. "Old videotapes" backdrop feels ornamental, missing micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when fog lifts at pond, forcing crystallization. But "tidal longing" repetition dilutes escalation; cost (abandoned chalk) lacks visceral weight despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing: "sound of growing older" emerges from concrete particulars (chalk lines, pond hum). Final image reweights "echoes" without stating theme, though "spaces between breaths" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("damp veil that seemed to mute memory of sound"), but "tidal longing" recurs with diminishing returns. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates perfectly with fog density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "string plucked long ago" mixed metaphor slightly muddles closure beat. High density throughout, though "frozen in mid-gesture" risks generic description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet" trope through specific chalk ritual and fog physics. Emotional truth in seeking time's sound elevates beyond gimmickry, though precognition label feels slightly convenient.</comment>
