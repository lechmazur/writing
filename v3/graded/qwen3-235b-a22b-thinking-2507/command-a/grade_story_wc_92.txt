<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (duty vs revolution) drive credible choices with visible cost in Thorne confrontation, but his underdeveloped motivation weakens the stakes crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "Thorne’s silence speaking volumes," though blackout’s unexplained origin slightly undermines causal rigor at the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder constrains choices and charges the final image, but "luminous fort" remains generic postcard backdrop without environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly through Elara’s agency (sundial decryption to key activation), though the abstract "oppressed populace" weakens visceral cost legibility despite Thorne’s hesitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("beacon not weapon"), avoiding moralizing, though "wake-up call" line flirts with thematic echo but is rescued by the quill holder’s final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "fingers brushed the bronze quill holder," though "winking hush" momentarily disrupts voice consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-duplicate sensory phrasing ("faint flicker"/"faint shimmer") creates minor scaffold, but final image achieves high density with "quill holder glinting in the light" charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in "cradle as beacon" elevates familiar revolution trope, but fort setting lacks specific verifiable detail to fully transform the premise beyond competent execution.</comment>
