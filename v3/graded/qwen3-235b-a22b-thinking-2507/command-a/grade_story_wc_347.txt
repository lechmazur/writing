<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses ("hated it—yet stayed") drive her choices with embodied specificity; the nut’s discovery and rescue crystallize her shift from duty to purpose with visible cost in the birds’ warning cries. No diagnostic labels, only concrete action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the bud’s emergence weakens the curse while mechanical birds’ "cries echoing like a warning" prove tangible cost. Causal lens holds firmly from nut discovery to map creation, with orientation anchored by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nut functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (warm in hand → fragile bud), while the labyrinth’s stone pillars and mechanical birds actively constrain choices during the rescue. Environment shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: the nut’s impressions narrow Elara’s options to map assembly and rescue, with the birds’ warning cries proving irrevocable cost. Agency-driven escalation meets the 9+ test through her deliberate choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the mechanical birds’ "beauty born of function"—not abstraction. The final line reweights "graceless beauty" as earned purpose without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured spine," "offhandedly exact") modulates under stress with rhythmic control; the traveler’s wide eyes show subtext without dialogue. No head-hopping, only deep focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("boots crunching on gravel" conveys urgency) with precise verbs. Final line’s "something had changed" recharges the nut motif without muddle, passing the text-artifact screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific choices: mechanical birds as "graceless beauty" and the nut’s organic precision avoid cliché. Emotional truth in "stubborn sense of duty" feels fresh, not template-driven.</comment>
