<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("rejected false comfort of nostalgia") but lacks contradictory impulses; interiority stays abstract ("mind racing") without specific embodiment in pivotal conception beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: bottle disappearance crystallizes Elara's perpetual motion with felt cost ("rejected staying"), under Accumulative/Textural lens with seamless density escalation from single lantern to cove revival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Amber bottle and lanterns function as micro-setting that charges closure (glowing lanterns as testament), though cove description remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: "conceive" action drives escalation from bottle glow to physical revival under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in her refusal to stay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action ("revival means creation not replication"), culminating in non-literal final image where lanterns reweight the premise with conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sea whispered secrets," "gravel crunched") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor abstraction ("mind racing") in para 2 avoided stronger embodiment, but final image ("lanterns continued to glow") achieves crystalline resonance without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and urban revival through specific "working memory" method, though "deserted alchemist" trope lacks transformative detail to breach 8.8.</comment>
