<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident (bewilderment vs. clarity) but micro-choices lack pressure; "brightened disquiet" feels unearned without visible struggle. Final choice passive—no tactical tradeoff despite "forbidden knowledge" stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("surge of purpose, a brightened disquiet"), but Accumulative lens weakens escalation—woman's arrival resolves mystery without protagonist-driven pressure shift. Final cost legible but not earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Astral orchard vividly rendered ("iridescent petals that shimmered like captured starlight") yet static; bathroom mirrors charge breakthrough but mechanics feel convenient, not pressured by environment. Fails 9+ gate—setting doesn't constrain choices or charge final image meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("nonlinear inheritance") signaled early but escalation passive—woman's exposition resolves tension rather than protagonist's agency. Conceptual cost (new responsibility) felt but not visibly paid; no tactical alteration despite "forbidden knowledge" motivation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Nonlinear inheritance" emerges organically through cameo and web-of-possibilities dialogue, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("destiny") reweights orchard without stating theme, but bathroom breakthrough lacks struggle, weakening earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("blossoms releasing a faint hum that resonated in her chest") with lyrical rhythm, but "simply complicated" recurs unnaturally. Stable single POV, though peak stress ("Why had she been chosen?") lacks compression—voice remains uniformly abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean prose with vivid specificity ("crystalline structure... mirrors that reflected not her image"), but "brightened disquiet" is label-heavy and "simply complicated" feels templated. No artifacts in closure beat, though final line risks sentimentality with "destiny."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "astral orchard" and pistachio cameo elevates tropes, but bathroom breakthrough feels gimmicky. Emotional truth in quiet resolve, yet lacks bold risk—no cost to Elara's choice ("ready to face them" avoids stakes).</comment>
