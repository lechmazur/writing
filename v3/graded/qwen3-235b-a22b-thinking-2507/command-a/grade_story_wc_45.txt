<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs yearning) shown through maze navigation and stone sacrifice, but "substitute body" backstory feels retroactively inserted without prior emotional groundwork, weakening the guilt's impact on her final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds consistently (tooth→maze→fountain→sacrifice), but conceptual repricing closure lacks legible cost: the stone's loss triggers abstract "warmth" without concrete consequence, failing cost proof test despite Charged Poise potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Garden's glowing flowers/whispering trees create vivid micro-setting, but the tooth (handled in 3 beats) only charges the final image through transformation into a star; environment doesn't constrain choices during pivotal fountain negotiation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending broken truths) signaled early, but escalation falters: maze tension dissipates upon garden entry, and "piece of certainty" demand lacks foreshadowing. Sacrifice deepens knowledge yet cost remains conceptual ("warmth"), not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Cleft in certainty" evolves from metaphor to action via stone sacrifice, earning thematic resonance without moralizing—though "nostalgic innovation" in final line risks thematic echo, narrowly avoiding penalty through earned image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("translucent enamel like moon fragment") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shines in fountain scene. No head-hopping, but "yearning she couldn’t ignore" slightly generic for peak motivation beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in climax, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("cracks of imperfection"/"cleft in certainty") and scaffolded gravel-crunching→steady-steps transition dilute propulsion in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Changeling tooth transforms "mending mistakes" trope through specific object logic, but garden's redemption arc follows predictable contours; emotional truth in stone sacrifice elevates without fresh inflection.</comment>
