<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "subtly confident" facade vs storm of thoughts; micro-choices (tracing phrasebook, kneeling on ice) reveal motivation under pressure. Final endurance (tears of understanding) earns closure but "subtly confident" trait lacks visible tradeoffs during discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the stream discovery crystallizes options with felt cost (tears of understanding). Accumulative lens holds through patterned condensation → mist progression; falcon's convenience slightly undermines causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen lake actively constrains choices (thin ice, vibration under surface) and charges final image; phrasebook functions as micro-setting that shapes the climax. "Rusted outpost" remains ornamental despite early prominence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("find where rivers begin") tightens meaningfully when vibration under ice alters tactics; agency drives discovery. Cost (emotional understanding) is legible but slightly abstract; could deepen physical tradeoffs during the trek.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through phrasebook’s reweighted "source" page and river’s quiet revelation—no moralizing. Final image ("language of the river itself") offers resonant non-literal answer to origin quest, charging prior particulars without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("condensation mimicking map veins") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "worrying tranquility" repetition; no head-hopping but slight overwriting in atmospheric cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion ("boots crunching against frosted floorboards"), but scaffold appears ("her fingers traced... its corners worn"). No closure-impairing artifacts, though "dry-witted" feels generic amid otherwise textured prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms cartographic quest through specific phrasebook/rivers interplay; emotional truth in "tears not of joy but understanding" avoids cliché. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure pays off, though falcon motif edges toward convenience.</comment>
