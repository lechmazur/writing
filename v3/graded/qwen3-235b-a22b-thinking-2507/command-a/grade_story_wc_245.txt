<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; "joy, sorrow, fear, love" surge risks label-heavy abstraction despite strong embodied motivation. Final renunciation (truth within) feels slightly unearned without prior resistance to internal mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the compass stilling crystallizes options with felt cost ("heart lighter, mind clearer"). Constellations' pause lacks integration into stakes, slightly weakening causal escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest actively constrains choices (vibrations as navigation), while the platinum compass charges the final image. "Liquid silence" and skin-language absorption transform setting into embodied pressure without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as musical notes intensify, but internal conflict lacks interwoven friction—Elara's "quiet blaze" shows commitment without visible struggle against doubt, diluting the cost of emotional vulnerability at the stillpoint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: mapmaking becomes emotional distillation, compass needle stilling reweights "truth." Final image ("melody lingered") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers danced," ultrasonic symphony) modulates perfectly under pressure. Minor deduction for "joy, sorrow, fear, love" phrasing momentarily drifting toward clinical abstraction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("ultrasonic hum faltered, replaced by musical notes"), but "strange yet profound" and "quiet blaze" approach scaffold phrasing. Final image avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blind mapmaker + vibrational language absorption transforms tropes through specific sensory logic. Emotional mapping premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with ultrasonic forest deepening stakes beyond cliché.</comment>
