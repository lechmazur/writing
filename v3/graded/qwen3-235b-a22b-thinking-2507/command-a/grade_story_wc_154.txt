<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strengths: "shrewdly innocent" trait embodied through micro-choices (tracing condensation, decoding smudged notes). Weakness: "lotus-hearted ache" label recurs without sufficient physical manifestation during climax; diagnostic phrasing in peak beat costs 0.4 per anti-pattern rule.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: stepping into night with "shared anxieties" and coral's glow crystallizes options with conceptual cost (enduring trauma to create hope). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) clear by para 2; persistent constraint (wrist injury/anesthetic) shapes decoding tactics. Cost proof: "numbness remained, replaced by quiet determination" legibly pays price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting: "swirled around her, as if air itself holding breath" charges final image. Coral fragment constrains choice (decoding under pressure) and evolves from "relic" to "beacon." Sensory hierarchy perfect: translator notices tactile details (condensation, cast texture) over visual. Misses 9.0 only by Q7 artifact cap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Accumulative lens: coral's glow intensifies with each deciphered phrase, narrowing Elara's path to action. Agency fully protagonist-driven (decoding choices). Cost visible in enduring numbness. Minor flaw: "shared anxieties" concept stated but not dramatized as active pressure until final line, losing 0.2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral's evolution: "The coral remembers what we forget" becomes actionable truth. Final line "ocean still sings" reweights war trauma without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—child's plea remains literal, not metaphorical sermon. Cap at 8.8 due to Q7 artifact rule despite perfect resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: translator notices linguistic textures ("shaky lines," "smeared by rain"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("fragile peace amidst ruins") to clipped ("She unknotted the first phrase"). Minor register drift: "conceptual repricing" terminology in climax clashes with translator's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Template cadence in para 3 ("The mist seemed... But it did little... The mist swirled") creates loop in high-pressure beat, costing 0.4 per artifact rules. Otherwise stellar: "condensation clung like tears" shows via texture. Final image "ocean still sings" achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms war translator trope through coral motif's specificity: decoding child's cast creates fresh emotional calculus. "Lotus-hearted ache" evolves from cliché to earned motif. Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Cap at 8.8 due to Q7 artifact rule.</comment>
