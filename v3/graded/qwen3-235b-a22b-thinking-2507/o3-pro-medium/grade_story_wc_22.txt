<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "immeasurable yet boxed by absence" and micro-choices like parsing bird cries with tomb-grammar, but "salt and sorrow" abstraction slightly dilutes embodied emotion during pivotal soil crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("green spears pricked through mud, arrayed like fallen soldiers"); Accumulative lens holds through ritualistic bird-call escalation, though reef's collapse as inciting incident relies on backstory without on-page dramatization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seed pods and jetty function as micro-setting: pods' "husks like spent cartridges" charge the final image while constraining planting tactics; "crablike craters" and "iron-flat" water evolve causally with the battlefield's sigh.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the coachman's agency (translating bird calls to map nutrients), with cost legible in "soil drunk too much salt" and unfinished task; escalation via ritual deepening suffices for Accumulative lens but lacks visceral friction in peak planting beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "battle lines redrawn by chlorophyll" reweights the submerged concord without moralizing; final image ("petals reciting dead languages") offers resonant non-literal answer to ecological rupture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "translating foam patterns as newspapers" and reef-Latin whispers; rhythmic control under pressure ("He did not move, lest shoe leather disrupt") avoids lyric drift, though "narrow vastness" risks thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "constellations like coin rubbings" and "chlorophyll battle lines" achieve high density without muddle; final line's "petals reciting dead languages" delivers crystalline propulsion with no figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms rebirth trope through coral-scribe treaties and avian nutrient cartography; "battlefield sighed in flowers" synthesizes ecological grief with hope in a non-obvious, character-rooted resolution that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
