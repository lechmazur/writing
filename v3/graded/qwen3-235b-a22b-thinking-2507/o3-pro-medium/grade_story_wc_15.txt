<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hauntingly optimistic heart" driving her to sew ruin into reverence, yet embodied cost remains abstract; blood sacrifice lacks visceral physical consequence despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the new corridor's opening carries conceptual cost (blood-soaked thread) and reconfigures the labyrinth's meaning; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tide pool basins constrain choice—Wren must gather shards to create instruments—while the illustration plate's physical properties directly charge the final image as the loom's catalyst.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via the labyrinth's shifting corridors, but the dominant "broken precedents" conflict lacks tangible escalation; the blood sacrifice feels earned yet the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The final path "carved from ruin to reverence" reweights the opening quest without moralizing, using the stitched instruments and violet thread to embody the theme through concrete action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barnacle shells crack like distant clocks") persists under pressure, though "hauntingly optimistic" recurs as label rather than evolving embodied detail in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high propulsion, but "hauntingly optimistic" appears twice as thematic label in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling closure's immediacy despite otherwise crystalline rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaver-as-navigator transforms labyrinth tropes through specific craft logic; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional cost lacks physical grounding.</comment>
