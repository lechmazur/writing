<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lacks deeper emotional contradiction beyond "cool, prismatic" calculation; the "latent blaze" hints at tension but remains abstract rather than embodied cost. Final endurance choice is earned yet lacks visceral struggle in pivotal unlocking moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: gravity's return forces Quillon into perpetual vigilance ("vowing to guard... until dawn"), with visible cost in his upward fall amid liberated artifacts. Causal lens holds flawlessly from inverted hour setup to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The grotto's inverted gravity and mist function as active micro-setting—floating pebbles constrain movement, mist swallows light—culminating when "rain still hissed" charges the final vow. Essential environment shapes every tactic and the closure's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the "sixty minutes" clock, narrowing options to a single decisive choice: speak the combination before gravity reclaims its throne. Cost crystallizes in Quillon's forced endurance—clutching the drawer as he falls upward—under pure causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges solely through action: "seeds of vigilance" sprout not as moral but as tangible cost—Quillon's quiet vow after gathering artifacts reweights the opening "latent blaze" into enduring responsibility without a single abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "numbers became colors, colors became directions," with rhythmic compression during inversion ("stones rose, pebbles floated"). Zero head-hopping; lyrical elision taught early pays off in the final "rain-soaked pages" perfume.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clandestinely luminous" avoids purple prose by driving action (navigating mist). One borderline metaphor ("whirring like a tiny engine of dawn") is redeemed by immediate sensory payoff ("perfume of rain-soaked pages") in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through "prism-minded" specificity: decoding via nerve endings (not tumblers) and gravity inversion as plot device. Emotional truth in tactile memory cabinet avoids abstraction, but risks remain constrained by the form's lyricism.</comment>
