<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "faith sometimes bloomed in darkness" amid fear, but dream voice's "warmly curious" trait lacks causal integration with orchard logic, slightly weakening flaw-driven motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the sunbeam's "precisely on the orchard's hollow" crystallizes the exile/return theme with visceral cost in "faith sprout like a seed that forgives the hand which buried it."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains every choice—roots gleaming like antlers force descent, fermenting figs scent the breach—and charges the final image where the beam "landed precisely on the hollow."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: inserting the tent peg (not coincidence) reconfigures "interrupted journeys" into earned continuity, with palpable cost in "hollow in my chest where belief had once camped."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the tent peg becoming a gnomon reweights exile as "merely paused," avoiding moralizing via the resonant final line tracking "slow return of trust" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "roots twisted with ivory bones" and "fruit fall like muted bells"; rhythmic control peaks when "light... pivoted, casting a fresh shadow" during high-pressure discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "smirked like theatrical masks" risks mixed metaphor; compensated by unparalleled specificity in "fermenting figs" scenting the wall breach during critical escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archaeological dig transforms exile into physical reconstruction (tent peg as gnomon), avoiding diaspora tropes through "catacomb orchard" specificity that charges closure with botanical/spiritual duality.</comment>
