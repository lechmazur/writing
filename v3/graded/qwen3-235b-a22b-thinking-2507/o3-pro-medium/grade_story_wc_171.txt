<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Petra's "hidden math" realization and refusal to retreat on orphan provinces, embodying the cost of redemption through embodied choices (spat water vs benediction) rather than abstract moralizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the signed treaty crystallizes reconfigured stakes—"upkeep would cost her tomorrow"—with conceptual cost made undeniable through the orphan provinces clause's visible resistance and Petra's mentor's whisper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The terrace's "blood we wasted" history actively constrains choices (ritual must occur there), while the clipboard's evolution from shield to burden charges the final image; micro-setting elevates beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation through ritual density narrows options meaningfully: water pouring tests commitment, helmet drinking forces trade-offs, orphan provinces clause crystallizes stance with visible cost in leaders' physical reactions and Petra's "tomorrow and tomorrow" burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—Rourke's spit signature versus Laure's benediction—and the final "flawed beauty" realization reweights redemption without moralizing, avoiding balanced toggles by showing genuine warlord resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Petra's perceptual signature ("tired constellations," "stained glass eyes") and rhythmic control during the ritual sequence ("drip after drip vanished") showcase distinct voice; Rourke's "metal fingers clinking" versus Laure's palm-lifting reveal character through gesture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("Lightning flickered... single chord echoed like misplayed hymn"), with "tarnished comet" and "torchsmoke" demonstrating textural specificity that never obscures the closure's crystalline cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms peace negotiation tropes through specific ritual (water in helmets) and moral calculus (orphan provinces over glaciers); "flawed beauty" motif avoids cliché by charging closure with earned risk in the Accumulative structure.</comment>
