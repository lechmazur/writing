<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eloi’s "flattered and terrified" duality; embodied emotion via "invitation hummed inside his ribs" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choices like requesting silence reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "pursuit matters as much as arrival" crystallizes the hand’s stillness after spent escape velocity. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (hum → leaf-fall silence) reweights stakes without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lunar observatory functions as micro-setting: telescope gyroscopic ring and camera shutters constrain Eloi’s solution. Final cosmic dust plume charges closure by reweighting "unwritten time" against Lyra’s light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative pressure: hand’s velocity escalation ("hissing against crystal") narrows options to Eloi’s counterweight dance. Cost is felt in Rhea’s "fragile as frost" voice after stabilization forecloses crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the hand’s shift from "measuring tides of light" to stillness offers non-literal answer about equilibrium. Avoids moralizing; "pursuit matters" insight arises from calibrated cradle mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Eloi’s camera-repairer lexicon ("bow the lens, slow the shutter"). Minor register drift in Rhea’s "dust easier to love" line slightly over-articulates emotional state mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "yawning through octaves of silence" demonstrates rhythmic control under pressure. Final line’s "delicate vigil" recharges "luminous ache" with crystalline propulsion—no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms timekeeping trope via lunar tide-clock salvage and light-tide measurement. Bold synthesis: escape velocity redefined as "private equilibrium" where movement/rest merge, avoiding abstract universality.</comment>
