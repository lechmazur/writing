<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitude vs connection) manifest in micro-choices like pinning Edelweiss to "mimic heart rhythm." Embodied emotion in "petals crackling like snow under boots" avoids cliché. Final endurance as keeper of memories earns closure with visible cost ("burden and privilege").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ampoule discovery crystallizes "isolation though witnessed never final" with conceptual cost ("distance implode"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure intensifies via gap-observation pattern culminating in dock plank revelation. Orientation anchored by word 3 ("opal dock in mist").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opal dock functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (mist necessitates gap-listening) and hides ampoule. Edelweiss petals' "crisp moons" texture charges final image of stored laughter. Sensory hierarchy reflects keeper's priorities: "gaps between gull calls" over visual detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Oswald's agency: "observing gaps" method narrows options to physical evidence discovery. Cost is legible in "clutched ampoule, feeling distance implode" and "burden and privilege." Single escalation beat (ampoule reveal) suffices for Accumulative lens, reweighting isolation as connective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through ampoule's safekeeping: "someone alone can best guard company" crystallized by final beam sweeping "like a hand promising isolation... never final." Avoids moralizing—resonance built from concrete struggle with borrowed memories. No thematic echo despite poignant phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in gap-focused noticing ("fissure flowed an image not his own"). Rhythm modulates perfectly: staccato for tension ("What had been given?"), lyrical for reflection ("mist curled like cats request company"). Zero POV slippage despite memory transference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crisp moons, crackling softly like snow" achieves triple duty (texture/sound/emotion). Final image ("beam swept like a hand promising...") avoids closure artifacts with crystalline clarity. Metaphors serve Accumulative lens without muddle—"gaps bright as broken glass" paid off in ampoule discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via specific mechanics: gap-listening as decoding method, memory-storing ampoule. Emotional truth in "keeping watch for fragile memories" avoids isolation clichés. Risk distinction: Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure lands through patterned density, not causal turns.</comment>
