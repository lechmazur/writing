<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; "paradox of that method" stated but not embodied in struggle during pivotal plea. Motivation intensifies cleanly through dictionary choices, but interior conflict remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "reality would continue but no longer as a secret" with conceptual cost legible in the mirror's "differences transparent." Minor causality hiccup with librarian's sudden appearance slightly undermines Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dictionary functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("cover newly blank"). Sensory details like "equations curling into silence" are POV-filtered and constrain choices—showing "Now" bypasses the librarian's challenge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through density increase: glyphs spinning faster force the plea where words fail. Cost is unmistakable—"perspective itself bent to unify us" reweights reality with conceptual price under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("resounding hush felt like dawn") resonantly answers "cosmic illusions" without moralizing. Theme emerges through the seed's shattering and mirror's transparency, avoiding abstraction while embracing unity's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scroll-haunted vaults," "breaths like lanterns") persists under pressure. Lyric compression ("across a universe's hiccup") is taught early and paid off in the climax's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pages fanning into wings" achieves triple duty (action/image/theme). Climax uses clean verbs ("scattering," "poured") with no figurative muddle. Final line recharges opening's "hush" with perfect resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "spiral arbitration" transforms cosmic judgment tropes. Bold risk in conceptual stakes ("kernel illusion") pays off through specific details like the "seed of darkness no larger than my thumb," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
