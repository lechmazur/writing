<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moira’s motivation to "create beauty from ruins" drives concrete micro-choices (pruning pain while preserving resilience), with embodied contradictions in her trembling hands and "gardener vs executioner" mantra. Interiority avoids therapy-speak through sensory specificity ("tasted that sound, sensing wars, cures..."), though secondary pressure is absent per single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via villagers’ communal tasting: "tears mingled with smiles" crystallizes cost (shared sorrow transformed), while Moira’s departure shows earned solitude. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—sensory density peaks at comet alignment, reweighting hope through synaptic "rewiring" without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse functions as micro-setting: its corrosion literally nourishes the fruit ("roots dove through rust flakes"), constraining Moira’s tactics by repurposing war-dust into "micronutrients." Final image charges closure as "monument to corrosion" becomes "ringing with stories," satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Moira’s pruning agency under Accumulative lens—removing "taste of betrayal" narrows options to communal nourishment, with visible cost in her silent departure. Time pressure from celestial alignment tightens tactics, though drought/war backdrop lacks on-page complication beyond setting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "umami of collective relief" reframes hope as communal seasoning, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("tasting new memories on morning wind") resonates non-literally, reweighting "ruins" into possibility without stated thesis, per Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in chef-specific noticing ("savory resilience," "acoustic fingerprints"), with rhythmic control during pruning ("tapped tuning fork... ripples through glass and bone"). Voice modulates under stress via compressed syntax ("Prune. She reminded herself."), though "synaptic plasticity" slightly strains lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("juice like starlight ran over her fingers" does triple duty). "Synaptic plasticity" risks academic drift but earns integration through Moira’s tools. Final image’s "luminescent sap" avoids figurative muddle, though "umami of collective relief" edges toward label.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of neurogastronomy and gentle rebellion feels inevitable: "pruning pain from possibility" transforms trope into visceral act. Risk-taking (celestial alignment as catalyst) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with specificity ("copper ladle that once belonged to her grandmother") anchoring universals.</comment>
