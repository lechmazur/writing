<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (lowering brush, scent of palette), but dream-boy's shredding outline lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure feel authentic except for the abrupt shift to camera solution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: sun's resumption seals the dream with visible cost ("yearned not to end but to continue becoming"), but the sunrise photography's sudden time-freezing effect strains causality despite prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: palette's scent and light-pooling constrain choices, while luminous cliffs charge the final image; sensory details ("hissed like cooling metal") are purpose-driven and evolve with the dream's emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically through Callix's method shift (palette to camera), with palpable cost in abandoned preservation; escalation falters slightly as the dream's fragility doesn't actively complicate tactics until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete stewardship ("shelve you until you choose a new author") without moralizing; final image reweights "luminous absence" into "warm presence" as resonant answer to longing's cipher, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate ("sky a bruise wondering whether to heal"), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure; voice modulates perfectly from lyrical to urgent during the dream's appearance without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; every line propels ("tide, wind, and heartbeats seemed to lean forward expecting narrative"); only minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly jars the poetic lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through specific "sunrise photography" mechanics; "luminous absence" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (dream as unprinted pages) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
