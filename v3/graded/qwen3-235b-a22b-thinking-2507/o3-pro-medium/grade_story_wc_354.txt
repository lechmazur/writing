<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Tomas’s shift from ambition (queen sacrifice) to grace, with embodied anxiety via the worry stone dent. Final choice earned through magnetic stakes testing his moral balance, though micro-choices during peak play lack layered hypocrisy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: smoothed stone and "covenant no longer eclipsed" crystallize cost of relinquished anxiety. Accumulative lens holds via magnetic stakes tightening moral pressure, with cost legible in "polished dent had vanished" reconfiguring his exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus actively constrains choices—iron stakes alter moves, eclipse deepens tactics—while the worry stone evolves from anxiety object to calm symbol. Charges final image profoundly: its smoothing reweights exile’s difficulty into peace without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Tomas’s agency under Accumulative lens: magnetic pull narrows options when he considers greed, culminating in queen sacrifice. Cost unmistakable in vanished dent and sacrificed ambition, reweighting moral balance as the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-as-moral-calculus ("beauty where forces opposed yet listened"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights exile’s difficulty into peace without stating a moral, earning resonance via the smoothed stone’s tangible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes Tomas’s tactical mind: "sparrows stopped debating the wind," "whispering magnets." Rhythmic control mirrors chess tension—short sentences during play—while lyrical compression ("eclipsed covenant") is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("forging an eclipsed covenant" does triple duty). Minor repetition of "hopeful melancholy" (para 4 and 10) slightly dulls propulsion, but final line’s "cautious king" ties to opening with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes through magnetic mysticism: nexus as moral scale feels fresh, avoiding cliché by grounding magic in Tomas’s psychology. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without confusion, making exile’s redemption inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
