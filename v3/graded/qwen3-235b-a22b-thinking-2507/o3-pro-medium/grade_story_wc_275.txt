<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in knife sheathing versus bounty-hunter lineage; embodied emotion via scarred palms and "hiss of arid wind" avoids therapy-speak. Limited secondary character depth slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when leader accepts "hope" cutting—cost legible in "glass remained unbroken" after convoy's "impaitence sheathed." Orientation clear by 30 words; Accumulative lens (density increase via rose rings) held flawlessly to end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass dome constrains every choice: vents closed to save stems, becomes negotiation arena. Final image of seeds planted "outside the dome" charges closure with environmental cost. Micro-setting mastery elevates beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency—rose rings force council's stance crystallization. Cost unmistakable in "glass remained unbroken" after requisition threat. Accumulative escalation via scent-permeated tension avoids causal pitfalls.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "why towers mattered" line—resonant closure without moralizing. "Engraved quiet" motif reweights prior material via council's softened shoulders, avoiding thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "senselessly perceptive to pressure shifts" and thorn-scarred palms. Rhythmic control peaks with "dawn burned the sky a tranquil blaze"—lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "hemorrhaging ballast sandbag scrap" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "senselessly perceptive" bordering label-speak, but immediately embodied via dome-vent action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" transforms pacifism trope through actionable horticulture—fresh synthesis where seeds literally weave continuity. Risk-taking (non-violent climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
