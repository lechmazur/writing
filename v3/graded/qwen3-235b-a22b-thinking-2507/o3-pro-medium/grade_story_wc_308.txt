<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Ithar's "weathered resolve" versus vulnerability to the pulse, but embodied emotion lacks specificity beyond "dust settling in ribs"; micro-choices like tongue-tasting flint reveal values without sufficient irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing when "the ledge stood within him" reconfigures navigation with felt cost (canyon's "screaming emptiness" threat), but lens ambiguity between Accumulative/Textural and Situational weakens escalation coherence at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (etched instructions, tongue-tasting) and charging the final image; "dust vines twisted behind them" exemplifies tactile, lived-in environmental interaction that shapes the navigation revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the wandering pulse "jolted" upon arrowhead planting, forcing Ithar to ground his vision with visible cost (risk of collapse), though agency in escalation feels passive amid environmental responses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "to persuade the world to move instead" crystallizes the central question via bird/dust mechanics, avoiding moralizing while charging the final image with conceptual cost of shared knowledge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "river-shale plates clattered softly, mirroring the crooked rhythm of the wind" shows character-specific noticing; rhythmic control under pressure ("sound flared, bounded by canyon walls") avoids head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("dust vines twisted behind them, sketching footprints"), but "tasting flint, river memory, and distant starlight" risks figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling closure immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "navigate without moving" trope through bone-canyon specificity and birds-as-echo-maps; fresh inflection in "dust vines" sketching phantom footprints grows organically from established mechanics without gimmickry.</comment>
