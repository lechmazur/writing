<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation to break free from Havel drives all choices, with contradictory impulses evident when curiosity overrides protocol. "Rising fury" lacks deeper embodiment beyond label, slightly thinning emotional progression at pivotal ledger discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as ledgers crystallize options with conceptual cost ("chains coiled in data"). Minor vagueness in chamber transition ("bricks sliding like puzzle pieces") slightly dilutes causality at climax despite otherwise tight causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subway tunnel functions as active micro-setting constraining choices (water depth measurements, crawling under mesh). Lantern's glow on ledgers charges final image, meeting 9+ gate requirement for environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from worker's confession to ledger discovery, with Mara's agency narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable in "chains I meant to break, coiled in data" as ledgers foreclose Havel's path with visible conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "entangled memories" motif and final "debts paid forward" image without moralizing. Final line ("vigilance must flow") resonates non-literally with drought metaphor, reweighting prior material while avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cataloging new dangers in old places") and rhythmic control under pressure. Slight register drift in "empirical observation" phrasing jars with voice during high-stakes chamber scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but minor scaffold in procedural detail ("water depth three inches..."). No loops or artifacts in closure beat, though "watchfully calm" filter verb slightly dulls immediacy during initial tension build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms bureaucratic thriller via historical layering; "entangled memories" as active plot device (not theme) feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, with drought/vigilance metaphor resisting abstraction.</comment>
