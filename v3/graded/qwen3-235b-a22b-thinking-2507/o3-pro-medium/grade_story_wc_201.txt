<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; trauma responses powerfully embodied but motivation remains singularly focused without competing impulses during key turns like the kneeling moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost in the 1/0→0/1 inversion; Accumulative lens holds throughout but the single deepening lacks the persistent constraint required for 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (drones halted, conductivity test) and charges the final image; lichen frequencies directly enable the mercy calculation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via trauma-memory ignition altering the formula, but protagonist agency feels reactive rather than driving escalation; the cost (conceptual inversion) is unmistakable yet lacks tangible pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mathematical transformation without moralizing; the final image reweights "mercy as constant" into "mercy as inversion" with conceptual cost, though secondary stake development remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (proprioception, UV spectrum) creates distinct voice; rhythmic control under trauma ("muscle jerks as testimony") is exemplary, but tense shifts in reflection slightly destabilize psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture or concept (e.g., "flesh speaks after mouth decides"). Minor register drift in "negative exponent" momentarily distances from visceral trauma but serves thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of mathematics and trauma creates fresh moral calculus; risk-taking (UV as penance mechanism) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the mercy-inversion concept edges toward familiar philosophical territory.</comment>
