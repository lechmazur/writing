<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's "forgiving skeptic" interiority shines via embodied contradiction ("cleft in certainty" beneath ribs), but Kedron's "shrewdly innocent" trait lacks sufficient pressure on his bone-setting choice during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with Liora's "cleft in certainty knit closed" through action, but the heart's "rhythm out of step with time" isn't fully integrated into the resolution mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bone-star constellations aren't decorative—they physically constrain the resolution (Kedron placing heart in flickering segment), charging the final image with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from tooth test failure to heart retrieval, but the initial "villagers called for priest" setup lacks immediate pressure on Liora's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("stitch living and lost into alignment"), avoiding moralizing; final "earned wonder" reweights skepticism without abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Liora notices "cleft in certainty" physically, Kedron judges stars "like a jeweler"; rhythmic control peaks in "Wind whirled, scent of milk and iron coating their throats".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "rib cage remembering its first breath" shows originality without muddle, though "shrewdly innocent" repeats verbatim once.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms changeling lore via bone-setting as narrative repair; "map new constellations from every error" synthesizes premise with emotional specificity, avoiding template risks.</comment>
