<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation ("transmute pain into masterpiece") is clear and embodied in actions like rearranging photos, but lacks contradictory impulses—no visible internal struggle when townsfolk arrive undermines earned endurance. Her "perceptively calm" trait enables the communal shift yet shows no cost to her own vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt in opening ("who/where/when" unclear past 120 words) triggers -0.4 penalty, but closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the mural sketch crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost ("grief lifted, shared, turned over like soil"). Accumulative lens holds via photo arrangement deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty. Lavender field and factory ruins create vivid atmosphere, but setting remains static backdrop—rust and lavender scent don't constrain choices (e.g., photos pinned effortlessly). Micro-setting (map case) charges closure more than macro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lyra's agency: lantern activation and photo rearrangement narrow options toward communal singing. Cost is visceral ("hands shook," "laughter stitched the group"), but conflict resolution lacks resistance—no opposing force tests her theory, softening escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "scent lingers in cloth long after blossom falls" reweights healing without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, but "masterpieces grow slow" edges toward platitude. Final image charges closure by transforming lavender from atmosphere to promise ("purple haze will guide them").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Capped at 7.8 due to Q2 orientation penalty. Distinct perceptual signature shines ("graffiti vines... mirroring real ivy"), and rhythm modulates under pressure ("Hands shook at first..."). But opening disorientation risks confusion without payoff, slightly weakening focalization stability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("perfumed hush of summer") deducts 0.2, but peak beats are clean: "rust seemed to pulse in time, shedding flakes like confetti blessings" avoids cliché. Zero loops; final line’s "rusted echoes" crystallizes closure with precise rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms collective healing trope through specific means: photo arcs as healing mechanism, purple cellophane reweighting memory. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—removing lavender’s role would break the causal chain of communal vulnerability.</comment>
