<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via stolen fragments vs. regret; embodied emotion in "tightening ache in calves" but "eroded ambitions" slightly abstract. Final choice earned by releasing giggle/sigh/curse with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("he may keep moving if he carries stories") lands with conceptual cost (relinquishing stolen fragments). Orientation taught early ("fractured stillness settles like dust") and disorientation functional for Accumulative/Textural lens at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon actively constrains choice (rotating pads erase memory, mist steals voices); camera wheel charges final image ("glowing with shared memory"). Micro-setting (coat-pinned fragments) directly enables closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marlo's agency under Accumulative lens: releasing stolen fragments into ghost's cavity narrows options while reweighting "regret" as currency. Cost unmistakable in cavity closure and lagoon's renewed rotation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "carries stories, not just steals them" crystallized via final carousel revival. No moralizing; resonant answer to "eroded ambitions" via strobing compass pointing to "paths Marlo has yet to erode."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("yarn of tellers untangles," "sepia as captured photographs") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from "fractured stillness" to "strobing compass," no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("regret, however, is a currency accepted by ghosts"). One minor abstraction ("painfully aware of his eroded ambitions") prevents 9.0, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: camera wheel as memory vessel transforms scavenger trope. Risk-taking (lyric time distortion) heightens stakes coherently; "disposable" reweighted as essential for renewal without gimmickry.</comment>
