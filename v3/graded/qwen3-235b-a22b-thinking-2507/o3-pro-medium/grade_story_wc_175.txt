<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pearl’s motivation as esoteric realist drives every action; embodied emotion in "tasted cadence on her tongue" avoids abstraction. Contradictory impulses (temporary vs. enduring remembrance) crystallize in the knot ritual’s earned renunciation. Minor lack of deeper internal friction beyond the core conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: grotto’s "blushing stillness" reconfigures meaning with cost (monarchs’ twisted route mended). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—cadence density shifts reweight stakes. Cost legible in "silence twisted their route," but early lens ambiguity slightly blurs escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Grotto’s micro-setting (cloud-tear pool, mist roots) constrains choices—moth wing over pool triggers the midwife’s story. Final aureole charges closure. "Transiently rooted" moss directly enables Pearl’s philosophy, but "sleeping ear" stone feels ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Pearl’s agency: whispering fails, knot ritual succeeds. Cost undeniable—"silence twisted instinct mid-flight"—resolved by mended cadence. Single deepening suffices, but micro-turn lacks escalation weight for 9.5+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: midwife’s "lantern of sap" reweights "overlooked histories." Final aureole answers the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, though "transiently rooted" risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "cadence thickened, like breath held before confession." Rhythmic control in knot ritual ("sliced moonlight, braided vine fiber"). Minor register drift in "mnemonic hinge" slightly jars under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "shy silver speckles woke" exemplifies textural density. Final line ("steady cadence reweave") recharges motif with precision. Near-flawless propulsion—only "rapid-growing vines" slightly generic in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Transitory rooted" synthesis feels fresh; monarchs’ "orange ribbon" transformed into sonic plea. Risk-taking (knot as mnemonic hinge) heightens stakes coherently. Not transcendent, but avoids derivative safety with "midwife’s hands vanished like dew."</comment>
