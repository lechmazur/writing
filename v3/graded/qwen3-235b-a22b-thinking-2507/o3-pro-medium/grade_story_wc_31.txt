<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hides behind truth" vs. hidden vow) drives the closure choice; embodied emotion in "thoughts sank below the black tide" avoids labels; flaw compounds until the vow forces visible change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the key tag's placement on the ledger creates conceptual cost (surrendered charm) and reconfigures options (sound now visible); Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the aurora cascade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (key tag) constrains choices—opening the door—and charges the final image (lampposts lighting in reply); brine vapor "whispering like pages" integrates environment with action under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Emil’s vow crystallizes the dominant stake (sound’s color = honest hope), with visible cost in the key tag’s sacrifice; pressure accumulates via sensory deepening toward the ledger’s resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the ledger’s "resonant" light—color belongs to "the promise sound carried"—avoiding moralizing; the final oar-splashes reweight the childhood lullaby’s indigo with earned gratitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("koi-shaped shadows," "symphonic light") modulates under stress; minor rhythmic uniformity in mid-beat ("he opened... descended... moved") slightly dulls propulsion before the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("brine vapor whispering like pages flipped too quickly to read") serves momentum; final line’s "every oar-splash painting a visible note" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "color of sound" through specific moral calculus (honesty = hue); the hotel key tag’s irreducible role—linking childhood, ocean, and closure—creates inevitability; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
