<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Amelia's conflict between inherited loyalty and moral duty; her observant nature drives concrete micro-choices like noticing the "hush" and scratching the orrery. Felix's "proof by contradiction" logic feels earned through her prior editorial mindset, avoiding stock epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Amelia's vow to print truth with estate-sale reparations creates undeniable cost (lawsuits, reputational ruin) under Accumulative/Textural lens. Storm imagery accumulates pressure until lightning "etches her vow," though Felix's evidence presentation lacks causal friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib constrains choice and charges closure—Amelia scratches the orrery "inkless," its screech echoing as stars "take dictation." Observatory setting actively pressures decisions via echoing arches and cloud-streaming dome, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. legacy) tightens through Amelia's physical interaction with the orrery headlines, narrowing options to confession or complicity. Cost is legible in "marble memories foot[ing] the bill," though Felix's sudden evidence delivery slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "orbits of regret" transform when Amelia scratches new paths into brass, making reparations the "new trajectory." Avoids moralizing; final image of "telephones startling dust into dances of accountability" resonates without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("catalogued sensations like editors catalogued typos") persists under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in "presses of destiny rolling ink across dawn." Dialogue carries subtext ("unanswered telephones were the only things I ignored") with Felix's voice colored by journalistic reverence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brass orrery bearing headlines" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor register drift in "proof by contradiction" (academic phrasing amid poetic prose) but never obscures closure. Final line’s "rewritten universe" earns its lyricism through prior concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms newspaper-heiress trope through specific tools (rosewood nib, orrery headlines) and moral calculus (reparations via estate sale). Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens pays off—closure hinges on charged image rather than confrontation, feeling inevitable through prior sensory accumulation.</comment>
