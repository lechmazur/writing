<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s embodied contradiction—quiet frame as shield versus whispered poets as courage ritual—drives choices. Final transformation lacks visceral cost; "light coiled around ribs" hints at physical toll but doesn’t deepen the endurance stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Lina walking on water reconfigures power with conceptual cost ("voices traveled inside her breath"). Security drones’ unresolved threat creates undeniable pressure without coincidence undermining causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Puddle reflections as map constrain navigation; "condensation from stolen punch" on napkin charges the final image. Auric lagoon’s "water warm where city runoff met hidden springs" directly enables the climax’s physical transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when alarms trigger—Lina braces but agency shifts to apparitions merging with her. Resolution lacks her active choice under pressure; coincidence (apparitions’ intervention) complicates but doesn’t resolve the security threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Indifference withered under the glare of recognition" emerges from concrete action (murals flaring, names repainted), not moralizing. Final image reweights "coded freedom" as embodied resistance without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "puddle reflections arranged a map," "marsh grass glittered with distant city light." Rhythmic compression under stress ("Security drones hummed... Lina angled her umbrella") avoids uniformity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ozone and library paper" merges senses efficiently. "Dawn found her unstoppable silhouette" edges toward cliché but "gilt halos around her legs" maintains textural specificity in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archival rebellion via specific mechanics: CornerLink relics as historical artifacts, "puddle-map" as permission. "Coded freedom" synthesizes theme and action without derivative messianic tropes.</comment>
