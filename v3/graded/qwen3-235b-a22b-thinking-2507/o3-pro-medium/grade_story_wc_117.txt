<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "cautious exuberance" grounds motivation, but the whispered pledge lacks prior causal escalation; embodied emotion strong though therapy-speak edges near diagnostic label in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (box warmth as tangible hope), but eclipse timing strains Accumulative/Textural lens—box opening feels coincidental rather than pressure-built; cost proof clear at "warm it had become".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mossy chamber) constrains choice via light framing and sage seeds charging final image; "dried sage seeds across the blanket like tiny stars" evolves causally to spiral formation, reweighting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("nurture lifelong wonder") deepen through eclipse pressure, but dominant conflict lacks tangible opposition—escalation relies on atmospheric tension rather than protagonist agency narrowing options; cost (emotional warmth) feels earned yet abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through curl/seeds spiral as non-literal answer to "ordinary magic," avoiding moralizing; final chord traveling "to someone not yet born" reweights wonder with conceptual cost without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sun wearing the first silver bite") modulates rhythm under pressure, but "stitching the world into one listening body" slightly drifts into corporate diction during high-tension beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("violet hush" for totality), but "stitching the world" overwrites peak moment; no closure artifacts, yet one mixed metaphor dulls propulsion in eclipse climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eclipse ritual with hair curl/seeds spiral transforms familiar trope; specific "paper suns" lanterns and ocarina tuning avoid generic magic—though therapist premise risks template without lived detail.</comment>
