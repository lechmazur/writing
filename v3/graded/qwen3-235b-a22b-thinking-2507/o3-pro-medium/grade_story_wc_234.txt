<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("capture density of presence") remains abstractly poetic rather than embodied; no flaw-driven mistakes compound pressure. Roan's burn offers felt cost but lacks tangible consequence for their choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with surrender of mastery ("nexus sighed, basalt brightening"), but cost stays conceptual rather than specific. Accumulative lens holds as color-shattering forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that charges closure: drinking pain, mapping paths, and pulsing in final image. Ember nexus provides pressure through slagglass pools and heat shimmer during key decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening when colors shatter under old arithmetic forces renunciation, but cost remains diffuse ("surrender of mastery" lacks concrete loss like broken tool or time forfeited).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("whispers waited... folded into fresh returns") reweights "revalue everything" without moralizing. Theme emerges through shell's actions rather than Roan's whispered instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting salt and star-dust," "space sagged like warm glass") with rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. Compression taught early sustains legibility through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "colors not listed on any spectrum fanned outward" achieves triple duty. Final line "burning gently and brightly" slightly generic but doesn't dull closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy trope through specificity (pocket-sun threads, slagglass). Risk-taking elevates stakes: conceptual closure ("stepping sideways") feels earned through prior density.</comment>
