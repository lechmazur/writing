<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren’s contradiction—“more heart than protocol” yet causing ethical harm—drives her lever choice with embodied cost (“gasped as copies of her breath crystallized”). “Mechanically warm” trait lacks deeper flaw integration beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren’s shiver and promise (“any future sideways journey would begin with their consent”) crystallizes the ethical cost of her proof. Orientation anchors by line 3; causal chain (lever pull → temporal tear → fix) holds with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Research station’s “dorsal fins” and “specimen aviaries” directly constrain Maren’s actions (aligning nexus, disturbing leviathans). “Mechanically warm” data plume charges the final image, fulfilling 9+ gate via environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single stake—prove sideways time without harming creatures—escalates causally: lever pull distorts time, intensifying “subdued awakenings” into ethical crisis. Cost is visible in Maren’s realization (“unzipped the creatures’ sense of rest”) forcing reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: final image of “fingerprints on the deck of cards” reweights time-as-knowledge vs. ethics without moralizing. Promise to leviathans shows earned complexity—no false balance, cost lingers in “shiver.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “holographic star-lichens projected lattice shadows across her goggles” filters tech through Maren’s focus. Rhythmic compression under stress (“02:15, 02:15, 02:15”) avoids filter verbs, sustaining causal clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; “timestamps merged; crystal breaths reabsorbed” uses repetition purposefully. “Icy warmth” evolves from sensory detail to thematic anchor without muddle. Minor deduction for “obliging sky mechanic” telling vs. showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope via xenobiology lens (“migrating magnosaurs,” “leviathan wings”). “Time was not a river but a deck of cards fanned sideways” feels inevitable, synthesizing concept with emotional specificity—no safety hedging.</comment>
