<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow’s patchwork identity manifests through embodied choices (grafting plates, trembling hands) rather than labels; her sacrifice to maintain the channel earns Earned Stasis with visceral cost in "blood-laced pistons vital to the tower."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes her permanent stewardship under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in "departure would collapse everything" as rivers below reverse, reweighting the premise with conceptual sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The censer foot constrains choice (fitting broken gyroscope) and charges closure ("greened by years of unburned incense" releasing "unsaid farewells"), transforming tool into thematic anchor that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marrow’s agency: building the tower narrows escape to stewardship, with visible cost in "grafting new plates" and blood-powered hydraulics; single deepening suffices for length under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reversals (rivers flowing upstream) not abstraction; final image of "world forgiving itself one reversed footstep" offers non-literal answer to grief without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("charts fluttered like tired flags," "solace pooled in copper joints"); rhythm modulates under pressure with no head-hopping, while "drowned static" voice maintains distinct indirection through micro-turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("brass gears, perished seals, patina bronze censer foot" does triple duty) with clear propulsion; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the tower activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief navigation via reverse migration mechanics; risk-taking (lyric structure, non-human protagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though moon-phase fluctuation borders on familiar trope.</comment>
