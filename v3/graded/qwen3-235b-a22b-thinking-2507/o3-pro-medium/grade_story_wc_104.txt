<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "patience was not the absence of urgency" amid artillery; embodied cost in collarbone sweat during key-tapping. No therapy-speak despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: emerging with seeds as wall falls reconfigures "resilience" with visceral cost (vibrations through beams). Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Carnival setting actively constrains choices—the toppled pegboard enables arrow retrieval, piano bench location forces chain-slithering. Dust and broken neon transform her silhouette into "envoy" at climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via sensory escalation (distant artillery → masonry thunder), but "wall comes down" timing lacks active complication of vault access; pressure tightens sufficiently under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "root beneath ruins" reweights "dry soil" motivation without moralizing. Final image rejects false hope ("cannot mend every crack") while charging resilience with earned cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "feathers' alternating colors marked intervals"; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("dusk bled salmon light") to staccato during key-tapping under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sweat pooled in hollows of collarbones" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor density risk in "hollow laughter of long-dead fairgoers" redeemed by functional atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seed vault trope transformed by carnival mechanics (arrow-fletching melody) and specific stakes—Sorghum Nova packets feel lived-in. Avoids safety middle with "strength bloom where no one thought life could stand."</comment>
