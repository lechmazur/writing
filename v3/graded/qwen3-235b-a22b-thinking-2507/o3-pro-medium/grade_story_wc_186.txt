<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in treasuring the dangerous "shard of hush" while fearing it would "consume the last notes"; embodied exhaustion during prism repair makes epiphany earned. Minor therapy-speak risk in "longing had been reciprocal" slightly dilutes the final insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Lioh's physical depletion ("Exhausted, he descended") and the prism's further cracking reconfigure coincidence into purpose. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through shard accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass pavilion actively constrains choices—shards orbit "like patient satellites" during repair, and corroded gears require candle tallow oiling. Final beacon light tracing "star paths he had charted" makes setting indispensable to closure's charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten purely through Accumulative escalation: each embedded shard "aligning when a certain note matched its frozen moment of chance" reweights coincidence. Cost is visceral (exhaustion, prism damage) and conceptual (redefining randomness as address).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete shards becoming "dark snow" that "recorded a coincidence"; ending avoids moralizing with "random currents now described a sentence addressed to them." No thematic echo—resonance stems from braiding slivers into the beacon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "retrocognitively blessed; memories not his own drifted into him on dreams like gulls." Rhythmic control peaks during vision sequence ("histories running like reversed rivers") with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "filament of song remained, delicate as thistle-blown hope" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "bruised the ears" stretching the "shard of hush" metaphor, though consistent with established poetic license.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through coincidence-as-physical-shards. Emotional truth in crews "feeling only that random currents now described a sentence" avoids novelty-for-its-own-sake, synthesizing stakes with fresh specificity.</comment>
