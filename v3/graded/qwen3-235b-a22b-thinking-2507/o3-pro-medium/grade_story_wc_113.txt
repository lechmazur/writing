<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (e.g., tuning viola amid flood to hear "gaps"), but ghost's "instruction" feels slightly convenient without sufficient embodied resistance to the command.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (blank program, irreversible flood), yet the trapdoor mechanism's sudden functionality strains causality under Accumulative lens despite water damage justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Flooded opera house actively constrains choices: water levels dictate reading surface (timpani head), currents nudge objects, and trapdoor mechanics force physical disruption—environment charges the final mosaic image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when "disrupt the stillness" shifts from intellectual quest to physical cranking, with visible cost in surging water and blanked program; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens flawless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "in between spaces" motif evolves from blots to mosaic, culminating in "hush... never empty again" without moralizing—resonant non-literal answer to silence/sound duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in musician-specific details ("harmonic, a whispery A"), though "Silvestri's outline emerged opposite her" briefly drifts from embodied POV into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rain still hammered the cracked dome, dripping through charred velvet" exemplifies multi-sensory propulsion—but "whispery A" edges toward jargon without full contextualization for non-musicians.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms haunted trope through musician's lens: water-damage-as-score feels inevitable in hindsight, with emotional specificity ("grief, exile, instruction") avoiding cliché through concrete stakes.</comment>
