<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict (honesty vs survival) manifests in concrete micro-choices: loosening the glass shard nightly, calculating "fear versus value," and rejecting the minister's objection with embodied philosophy. Her final calculation of "one life surrendered for two lives protected" avoids diagnostic label-speak through visceral context (inhaling bag air, imperfect numbers).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis through Mara's "motionless flight" escape, with undeniable cost in Corvus's blood blooming "more honest than any ink." The causal lens holds perfectly: her active waiting directly causes Corvus's impatience and the shard's fatal drop, narrowing options to a single viable escape path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: refrigeration units hide them, security tags enable escape, and the ink pot's glass shard becomes the weapon. Final image of the "small black sea" charges closure by transforming the tool into a symbol of future moral calculus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Mara's agency: her weeks-long preparation (loosening the shard) and active waiting directly cause Corvus's impatience and the reversal. The cost is visceral and immediate—Corvus bled into spilled ink—and narrows survival to a single escape method using scheduled body transfers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: ink pot mathematics, forged confession, and final calculation of "exchange rates." The ending reweights "fair trade" via CR—the "small black sea" where new equalities form—without moralizing, resolving into "the world was a problem set that only liquefied rigid thinking could solve."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara's mathematical perceptual signature ("pulse scrawled proofs," "twitching like an unreleased theorem") creates distinct voice. Rhythmic control heightens pressure: short sentences during crisis ("So she moved, but only inside") contrast lyrical reflection, with "deathly vitality" motif modulating from Corvus's eyes to her own heartbeat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; every sentence multiplies purpose: "Cold coils inhaled and exhaled like distant surf" does setting + metaphor + tension cover. High-pressure beats stay lean ("Mara seized the moment"), while final line crystallizes theme without abstraction. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms political asylum through specific, grounded choices: funeral home as escape route, ink pot as weapon/conduit for moral calculus. "Liquefies rigid thinking" isn't trope but active method (waiting water-eroding-stone), with risk-taking heightening stakes through Mara's complicity in Corvus's death.</comment>
