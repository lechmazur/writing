<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "resignation did not atone" and micro-choices like charcoal tracing; embodied grief avoids therapy-speak but "symphonically minded" borders on label without sufficient early tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("intention alone could not bridge distance") under Accumulative/Textural lens; river foam insight tightens tactics meaningfully, though transition from resignation to vial-mixing slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine constrains choice (foam patterns enabling insight) and charges final image (swans guided along divergent path); lupine/sage sensory details filtered through chemist's POV avoid tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atoning through connection) tightens via river insight forcing tangible action; cost legible in "intention alone could not bridge distance," though corporate fluorides backstory slightly softens present pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through polymer swans dissolving into plankton—non-literal answer to "separation/connection" without moralizing; dolphin tragedy avoids false equivalence while "divergent path" reweights from failure to prerequisite.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "river foam spelled answers" with chemist's observational bias; rhythmic control in "micro-vortices slowed" passage sustains under pressure, though "symphonically minded" strains lexicon consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density in foam pattern insight ("micro-vortices slowed... velocity returned") avoids scaffold, but "lupine and sage exhaled wet chords" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat; no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of polymer science and river hydrology transforms "divergent path" trope; specific coral-restoring swans avoid generic eco-hope, though dolphin tragedy echoes common eco-disaster beats without fresh inflection.</comment>
