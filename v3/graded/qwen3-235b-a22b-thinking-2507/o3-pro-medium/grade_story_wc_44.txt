<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orin's "quietly deliberate" nature drives his pivotal micro-choice (blade turned flat), revealing hierarchy of values with embodied cost. Vela's abrupt shift to humility lacks sufficient prior causality, weakening the rivalry crucible despite strong setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost (temporal exile risk), but orientation fails: "nocturnal observatory on floating isle" anchored too late (~180 words), triggering -0.4 penalty despite functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Automaton key constrains choices (blood on gears) and charges final image ("tucked away, vowing to guard"). Mirrors evolve from half-reflections to "whole," directly reweighting the dominant stake through tactile, lived-in use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Orin's agency (blood placement choice narrows options to survival vs. exile), with visible cost in Vela's flickering form. "Spoons bend reality" timeframe remains abstract pressure without live-clock mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Final image of shadow archive reframes "refuge" as non-exploitable truth, avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete stakes (blood as "living ink" vs. mercy), but Vela's humility shift lacks thematic friction in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("equations settle like birds") reflects Orin's rune-scholar mind, but Vela's dialogue lacks idiom differentiation—both speak in identical lyrical cadence during high-stakes confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "flickering like damaged film strip" violates established reality (film doesn't flicker when damaged), triggering -0.3 artifact penalty; closure image remains sharp despite this mid-scene muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "shadows at noon" trope through rune-logic specificity (negative shapes "cataloged by size and sorrow"). Risk-taking in conceptual closure (refuge over conquest) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though Vela's arc feels underbaked.</comment>
