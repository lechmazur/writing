<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract; "sensitively perceptive" label repeats without embodied cost during ash handling. Contradictory impulses under pressure (e.g., fear vs curiosity) lack layering. Micro-choices shine in light-fiber extraction but final insight feels intellectually neat, missing visceral struggle despite "trembling notes".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via vibration revelation and wind shift, with palpable cost in "eyes glimmering with unshed questions". However, "displaced axis" concept arrives late (~40% mark), making escalation feel unearned under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors within 120 words prevent penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Silo functions as micro-setting: corrugated metal enables climax vibration, fireplace ash dictates light-fiber technique. "Bronze quiet" recharges in final line as "faintest promise", charging closure. Only flaw: "mold-husks" slightly generic amid otherwise tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering pre-collapse wisdom) signals early but pressure lacks deepening. Finding diaries should escalate stakes, yet Ursa's reaction stays cerebral. Wind shift provides conceptual cost but no visible tradeoff; agency feels passive as silo "answers" rather than choices narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "walls that listened" motif evolves from Ursa's methodology to Clemency's practice to silo vibration. Final wind shift implies restored balance without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite philosophical depth—"lever" concept reweights prior material through image, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("ash would interpret her heartbeat as a gust") and rhythmic control. Tense inconsistency mars opening ("had journeyed far" amid present tense), muddying psychic distance. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Moth wings arrested mid-flight" strains metaphor; "arrested" contradicts ash fragility. Template cadence in "brick, board, or rivet" triple parallel. No loops in climax beats, but "breathed embers of gratitude" edges toward purple prose (saved by "exhaled relief").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes post-apocalyptic tropes uniquely: silo as "brushed bronze pillar", historian protagonist, tapestry as active artifact. "Displaced axis" bridges celestial mechanics and moral collapse through concrete actions (light-fiber extraction). Derivative risk avoided by specificity.</comment>
