<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs guilt) manifest physically as "lungs turn to shards" when recognizing Lyra; omission of the vow creates inevitable mistake that compounds, driving the earned closure of archiving the retrieved promise with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "cold weight inside his chest soften, not vanish" crystallizes the reconfiguration; Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "sampling frequencies of silence" through projection's dissolution, with pressure tightening via light-measurement mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (magic lantern slide's trapped auroras) constrains the climax—Quillan must measure its light frequencies—and charges the final image where the ledger entry "glowed, soft and resolute," transforming "quartz hush" from literal to emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Quillan's agency: sampling silence frequencies compels testing the slide, narrowing options to archival preservation vs emotional risk; cost is unmistakable in "realizing his careful enumerations had omitted the vow itself," altering his stance irreversibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory/omission emerges through concrete particulars (cataloging, measuring light), not abstraction; final image of "brother walking back to his shelves" offers resonant, non-literal answer to living with loss, avoiding sentimentality via the ledger's wax-sealed vow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in measurement-obsessed noticing ("tarnished brass caliper," "frequencies of light"); rhythmic control under pressure shifts from lyrical dawn descriptions to staccato tension during projection, with "quartz hush" motif taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "exhaling a plume that glittered like ground diamonds" establishes setting/mood in one phrase; no figurative muddle in peak beats, with "lungs turn to shards" providing visceral clarity during the projection climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work as emotional conduit—vows measured as light frequencies—avoids tropes through specific tools (caliper, tuning fork); omission guilt feels humanly particular, not template-driven, with the slide's mechanics transforming the premise.</comment>
