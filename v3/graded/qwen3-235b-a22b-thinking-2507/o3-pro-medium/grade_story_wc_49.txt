<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and immense but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices (cupping tendril, shifting to song) reveal values, yet no visible flaw complicates decisions as pressure rises—Orin succeeds flawlessly without internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: sap bells chiming and moon's "silver crest" reconfigure hope with undeniable cost (villagers' tears carving "clean lines through orchard dust"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to this crystallized moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Arbor constrains choice and charges closure: phonograph horn mirrors stars, soil "questing" for rhythm, and final image of Orin pressing ear to vines transforms setting into active participant in the remedy's completion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by textural density (crickets' retreat → rootlets stirring → sap bells) reweights the dominant stake with visceral cost (kneeling villagers, "orchard dust" tears), but protagonist agency lacks tested friction—plan executes without obstacle adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: wilted tendril → newborn leaves and "unfinished stanzas" offer non-literal answer to "remembering how the world breathed you," avoiding moralizing while charging the final lullaby with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dew glimmered like quiet applause," "ribbons of dawn light") with rhythmic control under pressure; elision ("sleepless midsummer nights") taught early and paid off in gearwork mechanics without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "fragrance of rain on stone" and "orchard dust" layers meaning without muddle; final line resolves via image ("crafting the next tale") with flawless propulsion through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes "healing through story" trope with concrete mechanics (phonograph translating syllables to vibrations); fresh inflection in stories spun into "living wood" rings feels inevitable, with risk-taking heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
