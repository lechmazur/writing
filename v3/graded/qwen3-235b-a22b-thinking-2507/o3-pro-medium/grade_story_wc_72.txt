<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aios’s motivation to "welcome nuance" drives tangible micro-choices (e.g., careful ampoule handling), with embodied contradiction in "knelt among them, resolving to finish the stalled conversation rather than mourn." Mineral-dust voice quaver reveals flaw persistence without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "cultivated nuance among ruins" crystallizes stance with felt cost (cracked stone, strained voices). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds via revelation density. Tunnel discovery slightly edges on coincidence but compensated by Aios’s agency in "threading his massive fingers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater garden constrains every choice (eelgrass tunnel, water pressure on smoke). Final image—ampoule shattering into "seed that had sprouted transparency"—charges closure by reweighting setting’s role in theme. Micro-setting (ampoule’s structural weakness) directly enables climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("Can certainty hold kindness?") tightens via ampoule’s mechanics, forcing Aios’s precise action ("letting only a thread escape"). Cost is legible in statues’ fragility ("stone eyelids cracked; bronze veins lit"). Pressure deepens through revelation density rather than causal turns, fitting Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "garden fresh questions" reweights certainty/nuance without moralizing. Final gardening image offers resonant answer through particulars (algae sowing, coral "blank pages"), avoiding thematic echo. Complexity honored by statues’ unresolved fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence had a sound like distant bells muffled by moss") and rhythmic control shine, but stress compression lacks variation—lyrical cadence persists unchanged during high-pressure ampoule handling, missing opportunity for syntactic shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "water sighed as he eased inside" integrates action/atmosphere. Minor deduction for "thoughts pulsed along them in quiet blue sparks"—abstract nouns dilute momentum in a pivotal beat, though offset by strong verbs elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms statue trope through underwater specificity and philosophical stakes. "Animate lifeless" tone feels fresh, but "after revealing the secret" timeframe slightly echoes common revelation tropes without radical reinvention. Risk-taking elevates coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
