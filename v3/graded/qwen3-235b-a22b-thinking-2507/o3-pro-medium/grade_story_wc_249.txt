<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("memories prefer knots" vs signing consent) manifests physically through drumming rebellion; closure choice earned by established trait. Single-POV limits relationship dynamics but micro-choices under pressure (tapping) reveal authentic hierarchy of values with visible cost (disrupting protocol).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise when Ira releases sister's memory, transmuting auroral sorrow into collective hope with undeniable conceptual cost ("dreams breathed together cannot be owned"). Accumulative lens holds: density increase ("wild vines seeking sunlight") reweights stake through rhythmic rebellion, with cost legible in director's realization and transmuted auroras.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Auric lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (drumming alters sonic field) and charges final image ("settled, reflecting a sky where auroras brightened"). Sensory specificity ("starlight that smelled of electricity") evolves causally with plot, avoiding static symbolism while mirroring internal states through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can fractured memories be healed collectively?) tightens through Ira's agency: drumming rebellion escalates pressure by introducing "syncopations" that spiral memories into wild vines. Cost unmistakable in director's pale realization and transmuted auroras, with moral calculus sharpening climax (individual grief vs collective hope).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "drumming on everything" transforms from rebellion to collective breath, culminating in non-literal answer ("dreams breathed together cannot be owned") reweighting prior sorrow. Avoids moralizing by showing transmutation via auroras brightening, with earned resonance in "sister smiling, no longer lost, only woven."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("frequencies glowed like breathing flowers," "starlight that smelled of electricity") remains character-particular under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("Ira inhaled, aligning her heartbeat...") with syntactic compression serving emotional intensity; zero register drift despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tiny droplets leapt upward, froze midair, and assembled into glyphs" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language ("auroras drooping like tired curtains") avoids muddle through coherent sensory logic ("dripped with sorrow"). Final line's "living chorus" achieves maximum propulsion with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms memory-therapy trope through sonic garden metaphor and rhythmic rebellion. Emotional specificity in "sister lost in hospital corridor's fluorescent hum" avoids generic templates, while drumming as resistance synthesizes concept and character into inevitable risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
