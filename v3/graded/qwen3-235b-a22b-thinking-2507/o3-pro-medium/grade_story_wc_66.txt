<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through embodied micro-choices (tuning throat to A, tracing masonry) with contradictory impulses (copyist precision vs. hunter's urgency). Minor abstraction in "stubborn as a metronome" slightly dilutes earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density escalates through lyric fragments to dust literacy. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("permanent cloak" embedding stories in fragile city sounds). Felt cost legible in signal fading forcing dispersal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust as micro-setting constrains every choice (copying on vellum, tuning throat) and charges the final image ("arranging itself into the first line of a new epic"). Ember alcove's tactile details guide action, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mila's agency: signal fading forces embedding stories in city sounds, narrowing options from broadcast reliance to permanent dispersal. Visible cost in exhausted return and signal's fragility makes stakes viscerally felt under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust's transformation—no moralizing. Final image ("dust rustled in reply... new epic") offers non-literal answer to "how stories survive," reweighting prior famine through embodied hope without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vowels soft as moss," "thistled calm") with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision (famine backstory) taught early and paid off in dust literacy. No head-hopping; voice modulates from hushed alcove to humming climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through dense imagery ("static reorganized into an overture built from windchime shards"). Final line's "fertile as dawn" recharges opening motifs without overwriting. Minor density in first sentence justified by lyric payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music/dust/storytelling transcends tropes. "Teach dust to tell stories" becomes visceral through specific mechanics (salt crystals as notes, dust carrying syllables). Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
