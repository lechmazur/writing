<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("empirically intuitive") drives choices, but sister's fever-dream motivation lacks embodied friction before the cavern; micro-choices (breadcrumbs, chip placement) reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visceral cost ("tears blurred the blossoms") under Causal lens; creek-rising pressure tightens options, though lens clarity wavers slightly at ants' introduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blooming cavern's bioluminescent moss and letter-door constrain choice and charge the final embrace; creek's rising water acts as micro-setting that alters tactics with precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding sister) tightens through creek's rising water forcing urgency, but time pressure isn't consistently leveraged until the climax; cost (decade of loneliness) is unmistakable in the reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through movable-type door reconfiguring "decisions" as physical act; final image ("letters rearranged... composing new sentences") offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("battered charts," "murmuring creek") filters all details; rhythmic control under pressure ("heart drumming louder than water") with purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "floral air despite midnight chill" exemplifies high-density texture. Minor cadence uniformity in cavern description prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: type-foundry mechanics as decision architecture transforms familiar "doorway" trope; emotional specificity in reunion avoids generic salvation.</comment>
