<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jonas' interiority shines through embodied choices (opening envelope despite protocol) and contradictory impulses (profit hollowness vs compassion pursuit). Mara's off-page idealization slightly weakens flaw integration, though her impact resonates through others' reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with locket inscription reweighting "cycles of compassion." Orientation anchors instantly ("sorted manifests"), but Mara's return feels slightly convenient, softening the causal escalation's cost legibility despite strong lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The locket functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—glass inscribed with signatures transforms it from object to communal artifact. Salt air and cedary shelves subtly mirror Jonas' emotional thaw without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hollowness vs connection) tightens through Jonas' investigation choices, but pressure lacks visceral stakes escalation. The felt cost—his demeanor "softened like rigging after docking"—is earned yet gentle, fitting the accumulative lens but limiting tension depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through radios → rehearsal hall → locket signatures without moralizing. Final image reweights "after symphony ends" into communal gratitude, though "quiet revolution" borders on thematic echo, narrowly avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Broker POV voice is distinct ("tonnage columns like poetry," "rigging loosened after docking"), but Liora's dialogue lacks idiom differentiation. Perceptual signature shines in noticing transposed digits, though "cautious exuberance" repetition slightly flattens stress modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled ("gulls rehearsed discordant arias"), but "whimsically attentive" repetition creates a minor scaffold loop. Metaphors stay fresh ("locket warming like moral compass") though "cycles of compassion" phrasing risks abstraction in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "unsung heroes" trope through maritime specificity (cargo hut radios, stevedore memories). Emotional truth in silent contributors resonates, though community gathering resolution leans slightly predictable, missing bold risk-taking for 9+.</comment>
