<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (self-blame vs. mission) compels key action (knot loosening) with embodied cost ("tears freezing to lashes"). Slight compression in forgiveness shift reduces friction before climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via self-forgiveness enabling rope reconfiguration, with visceral cost in final image. Auroral consent to task crystallizes causal trigger under Accumulative lens without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hoarfrost as "spilled pearls" directly constrains rope uncoiling; aurora's responsiveness to emotional state charges final image. Sanctum isn't backdrop but active pressure shaping every technical choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through rope reconfiguration narrowing options to precise braid adjustments, with cost legible in physical toll ("exhaustion trembled") and emotional release. Agency drives pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cedar box mechanics—pilgrims "ring it gently" to carry names—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("spring hummed forever") reweights memory as living action, not abstract preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in metallurgical precision ("sprues like branching reeds"); rhythm shifts from measured to lyrical during rope work. Zero POV drift despite dense lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "molten constellations" exemplifies purposeful density. Minor repetition of "transcribed memory" in adjacent paragraphs prevents 9.5+ but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope-as-time-machine transforms memory trope through comet-hair specificity. "Snowmelt ardor" risks purple prose but earns weight via bronze-core payoff, avoiding derivative sentimentality.</comment>
