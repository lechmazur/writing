<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in prime-number recitations versus spatial negotiation, but "wistful rebellion" leans slightly told; micro-choices like compass diplomacy earn closure with visible cost of moral compromise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through resonant architecture; Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost in "hunger already stalked the border villages" crystallizing the key's dual nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Compass constrains choices (etching circles) and charges final image; organ pipes' spatial mutiny evolves causally from "dust like ash" to star-choked dome with tactile, lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's spatial negotiation agency; the compass-drawn circle deepens pressure by transforming architecture, with visceral cost in claustrophobic panic versus starving villages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through key's duality (arsenals/fields) in final pocketing; avoids moralizing but "rebellion grew more wistful" slightly edges toward thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stone throat pressed shoulders" and prime-number recitations; rhythmic control under pressure ("Low notes crawled... mournful arches") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "breathing stale incense into her face" disrupts immediacy; otherwise high density with concrete propulsion ("tarnished key big as her fist") and no figurative muddle in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny transforms familiar church tropes through engineer-mother's compass as diplomatic tool; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry via earned architectural logic.</comment>
