<question>1</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Interiority is flawlessly embodied: "bones whispering like flutes carved from dandelion stems" shows contradiction (lightness/grief) without labels. Final self-forgiveness for surviving is earned through photograph ritual, with visible cost in "liberation hoarded becomes another weapon."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the spaceship sealing "carrying only silence" crystallizes the price of nonviolence. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—frost gate blossoming reweights stakes through density increase, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship actively constrains choices: "hull groans" force confrontation with "recycled wars," while spider-silk sling and gravity shifts directly enable the climax. Final image of "opalescent dusk" charges the setting’s purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Griffin’s agency under Accumulative lens: his "stitching" intensifies density until self-forgiveness reconfigures reality. Cost is unmistakable—"liberation hoarded becomes another weapon" alters tactics in the final gesture to silhouettes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: "faded photographs" where "images blur to hide weapons" reweights nonviolence as active creation. Final "garden where violence never learned to germinate" delivers resonant CR without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is airtight: "ventilation hum dips, replaced by low chime" filters sensory input through Griffin’s spiritual urgency. Rhythm modulates flawlessly—short phrases during temple bells, lyrical flow at frost blossoming.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line does triple duty: "fractal frost painting a gate of intricate petals" merges setting/action/theme. Figurative language ("flutes carved from dandelion stems") sharpens pressure without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</comment>Transforms pacifist trope through gravitational physics and "recycled wars" spaceship. The shadow work method via photograph tears feels utterly fresh, avoiding abstraction with "iron filings seeking a magnet" specificity.</question>
