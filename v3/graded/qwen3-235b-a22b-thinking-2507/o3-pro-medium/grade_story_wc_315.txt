<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (pattern logic vs. human trust) drive every micro-choice under pressure, shown through embodied cognition ("muscle recalled cadence for confidence"). The earned endurance—"dared not sleep until burden released"—forecloses rest with visceral cost via glove-bark friction and clipped buckle ritual, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: exhaustion seeping through limbs while "dawn’s first color warmed horizon" crystallizes the endless cycle. Accumulative lens holds—density escalates through sensory accumulation (sap smell, radio static) until the mountain pass revision reweights ceasefire stakes with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: its tactile memory sways command, then becomes a "ritual hinge" clipped shut at dawn. Arbor’s sway actively aligns with the convoy route ("tree lean south"), making environment a co-conspirator in redirection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency alone: recognizing mutinous convoy pattern forces immediate revision of leaf-map vectors, trading sleep for one more hour of peace. Cost is unmistakable—"exhaustion seeped through limbs"—yet the ceasefire’s fragility persists, foreclosing victory while preserving the fragile trust she guards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "trust preserved through pattern and patience" reweights "watcher’s burden" into indispensable craft. Final image—"attentive inventor of dawn, unseen but indispensable"—resonates as non-literal answer to "Can trust stand unguarded?" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in pressure: radio static "sounded like glass sanded smooth," coordinates drift "like feather avoiding ground." Rhythmic control modulates perfectly—short urgent phrases during convoy crisis, lyrical cadence at dawn—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line propels: "Inkless, she drew with pressure points only she could feel" merges character, setting, and action. Figurative language ("valley fires to city lights") avoids muddle even in peak beats, with paragraph cuts creating visual urgency during radio exchange.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "pattern seeker" as peacekeeper who redirects mutiny through non-violent knowledge ("offering unseen path"). Fresh inflection via "moral inertia of morning light"—a specific, non-obvious force that transforms abstract trust into tangible pressure without gimmickry.</comment>
