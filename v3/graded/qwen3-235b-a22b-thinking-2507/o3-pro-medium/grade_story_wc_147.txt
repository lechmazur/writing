<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "professional obligation vs gnawing curiosity" driving high-stakes choice; scholar's motivation lacks depth but serves as catalyst. "Dying stars" eyes and blood "petals" avoid cliché through precise embodiment under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: Mara's internal sunset transforms "lonesome splendor" from description to lived truth with visible cost ("cliffs that no longer existed"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density reweights "ephemeral" theme at final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the vial's tripwires and oxygen clock constrain every choice, culminating in the floating temple's mosaics charging the final image ("palette of lived daylight"). Coral pillars and lanternfish establish spatial coherence within 80 words.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency as oxygen depletion forces micro-surgery precision; cost crystallizes when Mara trades speed for vial preservation ("time runs short" becomes tactical reality). One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "crystal perfume vial" motif: the final image reweights "ephemeral" as carryable truth without moralizing. "Perfumes no vacuum could erase" delivers non-literal answer to preservation dilemma through sensory charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cobalt gloom" and "bioluminescent spores" filtered through diver's expertise; rhythmic control peaks during laser navigation ("balletic precision"). Zero head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "violet and salt curled through like distant gull cries" exemplifies high-density prose. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" moment risks overwriting but pays off in closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "perfume vials" as time capsules transforms preservation trope. Risk-taking in sensory-driven Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry ("fragrant notes... despite sealed suit" defies physics for thematic truth).</comment>
