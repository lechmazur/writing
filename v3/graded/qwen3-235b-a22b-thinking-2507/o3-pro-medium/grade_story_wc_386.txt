<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's micro-choices ("hands on melted globe," speaking before monks stir) concretely manifest her truth-weaving motivation under pressure. Keeper's internal conflict shines through "knocking invisible glass," but Mara's cost lacks visceral specificity—her fulfillment feels earned yet emotionally untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "silence felt lighter" reweights silence into space with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through dream-stitching density, though the keeper's release lacks a persistent constraint shaping Mara's tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glacier ice functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—monks' denial chains the keeper, while candlelight enables the globe's refraction. Final image ("glacier cry and glitter") charges closure by transforming ice into "corridors of trapped air blinking with memory."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. denial) escalate through Mara's agency: dream analysis narrows to exposing the glacier's tomb. Cost is unmistakable in the monks' recoil and glacier tremor, though the keeper's resolution leans slightly convenient without deeper tactical friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "windows of connection" becoming "mirrors of loneliness" then "glass upon glass"—no moralizing. Final image reweights truth's cost as "space instead of absence," avoiding false equivalence (monks' denial has consequences).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath shimmering like borrowed starlight," "trembling constellation") modulates under pressure. Purposeful compression ("Meditation began not with chanting, but with sleep") is taught early and pays off in the dream-theatre climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frozen petals tumbled as gentle rain" avoids cliché with textural specificity. High density peaks in closure: "silence felt lighter" crystallizes concept without abstraction, and rhythm accelerates through "suddenly glacier walls grew translucent."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "ghost whisperer" trope: truth as active salvage ("salvage something pure") within ice-bound systems. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "borrowed starlight" risks thematic echo but earns charge through final reprise.</comment>
