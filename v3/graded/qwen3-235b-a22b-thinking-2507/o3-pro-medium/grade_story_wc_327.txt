<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile perception ("ears felt the grain of stone") avoids stock phrasing, but micro-choices under pressure lack contradictory impulses at climax; final recitation feels too resolved for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: diamond's crack seals the passage with conceptual cost ("cure and curse share letters"), and Accumulative lens holds through textural pressure as language bleeds out.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Towers of bone and flawed diamond actively constrain choices—the diamond's fracture aligning with rock microfractures directly enables the climax, charging the final image of rustling phonemes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through textural escalation ("echoes argued, overlapping until meaning tangled"), with agency driving the pressure shift as Ioreth hurries against collapsing vowels; cost (diamond destruction) visibly alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "curse and cure share letters" crystallizes in the revival moment without moralizing; final image reweights language's survival as "newborn phonemes" beyond the canyon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("storm swifts sliced sky into glyphs") modulates rhythm under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every phrase pulls double duty ("vellum awaiting vibration-imprints" establishes tool and stakes), with no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the language's collapse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "dying language" trope through specific mechanics (texture translation, bird glyphs as siphon), with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring the closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
