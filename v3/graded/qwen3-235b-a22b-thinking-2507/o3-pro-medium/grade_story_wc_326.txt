<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s heartbeat counting shifting from panic discipline to marking continuance; embodied regret as "wolves beneath the bed" avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: Epiphany edges toward tidiness but earns weight via visceral tape sacrifice and transformed memory imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"counting to mark continuance" crystallizes stance shift with cost (irreplaceable memory transformed). Accumulative lens holds: ink density and shard alignment tighten pressure without causal breaks. Cost proof: "regret had become circuitry" legible in final orbit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: porcelain shard and ink constrain choices (pivot for electricity, memory conduit) and charge closure (laughter carried on broken porcelain). Opal dome’s internal shimmer reweights snow’s initial "surrender" breath—environment shapes every tactical move under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening via agency: Mara’s PLAY button press forces trade-off (raw memory for wisdom). Cost is unmistakable—tape’s resentment transmuted into unsullied image, altering her emotional reality. Escalation driven by her choices, not coincidence, under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through tape’s transformation: "failure is... its bloodstream" resonates via ink-to-light alchemy, avoiding moralizing. Final image (shard-carrying laughter) reweights prior bitterness without sentimentality—complex cost of growth earned through concrete sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: scientific precision ("magnetic tremors humming") merges with poetic compression ("velvet pressed against the soul"). Rhythmic control under stress—short beats during shard alignment, lyrical flow at closure—teaches pattern early and pays off in earned solace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; each line propels ("electricity crawled like silver spiders"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle—"fresh bolts" stars reconfigure earlier snow’s suffocation. Final line’s "convincingly alive" crystallizes prior motifs with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ingenuity in digital ghost’s mechanics: defragmentation mirrors Mara’s emotional integration through ink/spilled memory. Transforms "wisdom from failure" trope via porcelain shard’s irreplaceable role—risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
