<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between painful memories and seeking home's shape drives micro-choices; "buried talents" action reveals hierarchy of values when the stone's weight shifts from regret to guidance during reorganization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "risked being sealed inside a chapter forever," reconfiguring home as direction; accumulative lens holds through "substitutes reality nightly" pressure tightening the final seeding act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore setting actively constrains choices (reorganizing corridors forcing quick seeding) and charges closure as "valley opened like a fresh page," with the stone's physical weight ("heavier than regret") becoming a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when reorganization forces seeding before corridors seal; cost is unmistakable in "risked being sealed inside a chapter forever" and the stone's weight shifting from crushing to warm, driving the final lullaby action under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image "footsteps wrote the first line of returning" offers resonant, non-literal answer to "shape of home" without moralizing, reweighting the feather map's dissolution and stone's warmth through concrete action rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "biographies that breathed like sleeping whales" and "phosphorescent margins," with rhythmic compression during reorganization ("words of the doorway clattered like teeth") teaching the accumulative pattern early and paying off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "silent sheet lightning behind eyelids" crystallizes closure without muddle, though "talents long buried unfurled" slightly risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate tactile action ("etching each step with the stone").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magical bookstore" trope through specific mechanics (reality substitution, feather map texture), with emotional truth in home as carried direction; the lullaby's impossible syllable feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
