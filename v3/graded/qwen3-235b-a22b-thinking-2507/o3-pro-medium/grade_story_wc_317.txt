<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses clear (craving quiet yet embracing stench), but germination urgency lacks layered struggle; micro-choices like brook water selection reveal values without emotional complexity at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (surrendering control to innovation's urgency), but seed's rapid germination feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook constrains choice (water source affecting seed) and charges final image ("moonlight edged the brook in pewter"), with sensory details woven into action like "brook water gentler than tap" altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when seed cracks prematurely, forcing immediate venting/airflow planning; protagonist's agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens with visible cost of abandoning coffee for aroma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights "hush" into active potential ("every unlocked tomorrow begin to turn") without moralizing, emerging purely from concrete particulars like orthogonal puzzle design and scent-based challenges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers tingled as she cracked the seal"), rhythmic control under pressure ("Tiny fissures spidered"), and taught elision of backstory through present micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "brook’s murmurs intertwined with silence, composing a strange duet" simultaneously advances atmosphere, character, and thematic weight without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms escape room trope through olfactory innovation ("scent over sight"), with corpse flower's discomfort synthesizing into inevitable thematic truth about creativity's necessary discomfort.</comment>
