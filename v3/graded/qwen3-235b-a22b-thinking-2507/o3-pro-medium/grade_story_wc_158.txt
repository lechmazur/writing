<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("torment into ink" vs "fruit refused to ripen") drives choice to plant postcard; embodied cost in trembling hands; minor abstraction in "quarreling voices" slightly dilutes flaw visibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: war ceases "in shared breath" with cosmic cost (dissolving elder, seeds broadcast); Accumulative lens holds through density shift at blossoming; orientation clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell actively constrains choice (amplified brine denying sleep) and charges final image (echoes become breathing); reef micro-setting enables "algae sip sorrow" metaphor that fuels alchemy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inner war vs blossom armistice) tightens via postcard’s demand; escalation through sensory accumulation (off-key wind → harmonizing) with felt cost (elder dissolving into motes); agency clear in planting choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "blossom armistice" reprise: final image of pain "turning green" reweights "photosynthesize pain" without moralizing; avoids binaries by embracing "hush of color" amid broken thoughts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("time stretched like salted taffy") reflects poet’s mind; rhythmic control under pressure ("shyly unstoppable" shimmer); no head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via "cathedral echoes of brine".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; minor overwriting in "pearly dust" eddies slightly blurs action; no loops in closure beat; final line’s "gentle breathing" avoids closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomnia alchemy and cosmic healing; "blossom armistice" transforms pain tropes through specific reef-shell logic; risk-taking (future self as guide) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
