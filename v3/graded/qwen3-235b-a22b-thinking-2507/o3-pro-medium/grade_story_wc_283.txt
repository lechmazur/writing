<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; "quietly inspired" trait remains untested under pressure. Strong embodied choices (button arrangements) but no visible tradeoffs in micro-decisions. Final endurance lacks visceral cost beyond exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands (prophecy becomes "dialogue") but cost legibility fails; "exhausted but radiant" lacks felt price. Accumulative escalation holds with sand chaos → outside participation, though dawn deadline tension evaporates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Warehouse and buttons function as micro-setting that constrains choices (velvet tray alignment) and charges final image ("cataloged buttons gathered"). Sensory specificity ("dust motes trembled") directly shapes the prophecy unscrambling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscramble prophecy before dawn) signaled early but time pressure dissolves; no visible price beyond fatigue. Escalation via sand chaos → inviting outside world succeeds under Accumulative lens, yet cost remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "Share or disappear" imperative reweights prior button-cataloging into participation. Final image ("prophecy change course... freshly born as raw possibility") delivers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mineral ink," "canyon echo in a jar") with rhythmic control matching tension shifts. Psychic distance modulates perfectly during echo release; zero register drift even under peak stress of swirling sand.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in opening ("vast halls breathing with unearthed silence") but zero loops or figurative muddle. Propulsion flawless: "sand paused, reversed" compresses action while "luminous paragraph waiting for ink" crystallizes climax without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through specific ritual (button cataloging) and emotional truth in "exhausted but radiant" duality. Risk-taking with accumulative structure pays off; buttons detail avoids abstraction while charging closure.</comment>
