<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("lonesome splendor" vs redemption hope) drives the music box choice; embodied grief in father's "eyes puddled like moonlit tide pools" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of full redemption earned by prior causality but cost feels slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sending the music box into daylight crystallizes the "gleaned redemption" stake with conceptual cost ("redemption... only gleaned like wheat"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory layering; cost proof solid in "his own heart thrummed with the same lonesome splendor".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feral loft setting charges closure: "lonesome splendor" motif evolves from description to final image constraint ("built the loft" → "hearing future voices knocking"). Micro-setting (music box) directly enables the pivotal sound-transfer choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("gleaned redemption") tightens when family arrives, forcing the poet's translation choice. Cost legible in enduring loneliness despite success ("his own heart thrummed... same lonesome splendor"), but escalation lacks one visceral price paid during the action sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the music box transfer: "sweeten the ache of time" evolves from abstract belief to embodied action, then reweights into "translation work had only begun". Final image answers the central question without moralizing, embracing complexity of partial redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand freckles," "trembling hush") persists under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from wistful ("positively wistful") to urgent ("chest beat louder than the surf"). No head-hopping; free indirect style clean in "He believed these murmurs could sweeten..."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("surf roar burst out, soaking corners with invisible spray") propels momentum. One borderline dense beat ("gray morning light danced...") in high-pressure moment barely avoids muddle. Final line’s rhythm crystallizes the theme flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "sound collector" trope through specific mechanics (glass jars, music box transfer) and non-obvious emotional calculus (redemption as "gleaned," not owned). Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("Grandmother Humming Under Storm Roof") anchors universals.</comment>
