<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (guilt vs clarity) but "crystalline clarity" borders on diagnostic label-speak; micro-choices under pressure (picking Silence corridor) reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("mass extinction" guilt) and "darkening brightness" final image; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric escalation to rainlake climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rainlake surface functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (stepping onto it) and charges final image; viaduct bricks evolving into helix directly alters tactics during memory retracing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (identity fragmentation) tighten meaningfully when corridor choices multiply; cost legible through "guilt of mass extinction" as timelines collapse, shaping final renunciation of tyrant-Iras.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (wiping droplets), but "map impossible to draw yet easy to walk" risks thematic echo; final image reweights identity as diffused power/love without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("darkening brightness," "prismatic shadows"); rhythmic control peaks in rainlake sequence where compression teaches pattern without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("droplets hung like planets on pause") but "vivid they scorched" slightly overwrites; final line’s "darkening brightness" achieves textural specificity without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of procedural generation with memory work; risk-taking (fractured timelines as psychological landscape) heightens stakes coherently through "rainlake editors' room" conceit.</comment>
