<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("tug of history the way sailors feel tide") but "precisely humane" feels labeled rather than embodied tradeoffs; flaw-driven valve action earns closure though micro-choices lack visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (memory vs engineering erasure), but cost legibility wavers—"fragile inch" valve act lacks tactical consequence; lens (Accumulative) holds through photo trail's density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ridgeway mud and rotwood pier constrain choices (boots sucking, pinning photos), charging final image; "midnight ridgeway at twilight" temporal clash slightly undermines spatial logic though micro-setting qualifies.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through photo discoveries but escalation lacks tangible price—valve disobedience feels consequence-free as no patrols or alarms threaten; pressure tightens via accumulation yet cost remains conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sapphire label reprise under Clara's photo; avoids moralizing but "water carries memory better than any archive" edges toward thematic echo, narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("slivered moon glimmers like a coin dropped"), but "precisely humane" disrupts lexicon with clinical diction; psychic distance modulates perfectly from solitary discovery to communal dawn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ribs of a leviathan" metaphor charges closure without muddle. Slight density issue in "tug of history the way sailors feel tide" risks mixed vehicle but doesn't obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms drowned-town trope via tactile artifacts (cobalt bottles under sepia photos); emotional specificity in "Clara and Vicente March" etching feels fresh though premise echoes familiar memory motifs.</comment>
