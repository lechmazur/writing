<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orin’s muteness creates embodied contradiction ("solitude throbbed for purpose" vs fear of fracturing mute eloquence), with micro-choices like cross-legged patience earning his final acceptance. Ghosts apply immediate pressure as secondary characters, but "tranquilly perceptive" leans slightly told rather than shown through action during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost unmistakable in "weight settle upon his ribcage like a hive." Accumulative lens established by "contextual clues" holds through unlocking sequence; orientation anchors clear by line 3 ("blistered dunes," "abandoned beekeeping oasis").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Scorched oasis micro-setting constrains choices: honey drums' "sticky echo" maps Orin’s path, royal jelly shards frame the box discovery. Final image recharged as dunes "seep back color" under his hum—environment directly shapes tactics and closure charge per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Orin’s agency: his patient "breathing with tempo of bees" narrows options when iron vines threaten to snap, reweighting the stake ("preserve unspoken words") through felt cost on ribcage. One meaningful deepening suffices for length, though tension peaks lack a micro-turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: "indentations, as though words had chosen silence" and final "taste honey in the dark" reweight quiet as resonant. Avoids moralizing; the covenant’s conceptual cost ("settlers died rather than break pledge") charges closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via bee-centric imagery ("breathing with tempo of bees," "pollen dust"), with rhythmic control tightening during unlocking ("hours, or perhaps a drift of moons"). Slight register drift in "tranquilly perceptive" but no head-hopping; elision taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sticky echo... mapped a path" demonstrates high density. Final line’s "taste honey in the dark" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. Minor register tension in "bruise colored halos" but no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through mute stewardship of unspoken vows—specificity in wax parchment and iron vines feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes (covenant with ghosts) without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors universals in scorched oasis.</comment>
