<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eron’s dual role as maintainer/disruptor; embodied emotion in ankle pain and heartbeat "thumping like a broom" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to dismantle labyrinth feels earned through consistent curiosity about trees, though internal conflict between duty and discovery lacks deeper friction in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: labyrinth straightening "as though exhaling centuries" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—sorrow density shifts via sextant’s transformation—while the pin-drop moment tightens pressure organically without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow in gutters constrains Eron’s entire mission, and the sextant’s brass directly charges the climax when sap "touched brass." Final image of "dew-soaked constellations" reweights moonlight’s role from atmospheric detail to active healing force, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Eron’s agency: mapping dreams with chalk directly narrows options, converting sorrow into vapor that alters the labyrinth’s structure. Cost is unmistakable—"centuries of convoluted grief" exhaling—as the sextant’s repair reconfigures the dominant stake of sorrow’s release under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: trees witnessing "ordinary miracles layered like bark" reframes sorrow as hoarded history. Final image of Eron and trees sharing "the same horizon" resonates without moralizing, reweighting "mundane miracles" through the sextant’s restored function and mop set aside.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—"sorrow rattled like a caged thunderclap" filters physics through emotional urgency. Rhythmic control peaks during the pin-drop silence where sentence fragments ("Passages froze...") mirror Eron’s suspended breath, teaching compression early that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Lines glimmered with runoff sorrow, and when the patterns closed, the floor opened" compresses cause/effect without scaffold. One hairline slip—"caged thunderclap" slightly strains metaphor coherence—but density remains high with no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms labyrinth tropes via quantified sorrow’s tactile mechanics; "healing in moonlight" gains specificity through ankle/tree scars mending simultaneously. The fresh synthesis—sextant as sorrow-converter mapping "a sky only trees could see"—feels inevitable yet revelatory, hitting risk-distinction bonus.</comment>
