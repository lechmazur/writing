<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in glass-specific perception ("saw stories inside each fragment") with embodied micro-choices like selecting the green bottle shard. Minor slip: "fragile as a child tracing letters" edges toward diagnostic phrasing but redeemed by concrete context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: villagers' "glimmers of atrium color in their pupils" reconfigures perception with conceptual cost ("before the town forgot how to look"). Pond rings' nightfall constraint creates meaningful tightening without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (repair within cracks) and charges the final image (colors in villagers' pupils). "Salvaged fragments polished until ordinary daylight backed away" demonstrates tactile specificity that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("mending fractures mirrored the town") deepens through pond rings' escalating warnings, culminating in the nightfall constraint that narrows options. Conceptual cost ("illuminate value in the mundane") is unmistakable in the deckhands' transformed perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "mosaics that painted their wrinkles gold" dramatizes refracted wonder. Final image reweights the central question without moralizing—villagers' pupils showing atrium colors offer resonant non-literal answer to "illuminate value in the mundane."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in glass-centric noticing ("hairline seams, splitting yet salvageable") with rhythmic control under pressure ("Purpose clarified her breath; she rose"). Patterned elision of backstory taught early and paid off through the mother's method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "sun shards speared the mist" does triple duty as image/atmosphere/metaphor. Minor artifact: "opalescent flames" slightly mixed metaphor but doesn't obscure closure. Final line charges payoff without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "noctilucent reckonings" from scientific term into emotional stakes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—glass repair as communal perception shift avoids tropes through specific "reweaving" verbs and tactile details like "chipped beer bottle crescent."</comment>
