<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; narrator’s shift to naming feels earned yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped beyond initial suspicion. Heartbreak motivation resonates without layered self-deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("holding the universe in my lungs"), but escalation relies on coincidental void appearance rather than protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory’s prism lenses constrain the climax choice ("angling it so last daylight fractured"), charging the final image with "sealing recordings inside marble corridors like seeds" as micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming fears) tightens via void emergence, but resolution depends on unearned prism solution rather than protagonist agency; cost felt yet escalation lacks causal ownership.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights "echo of sacrifice" into "ancient starlight awaiting new constellations" without moralizing, embodying theme through naming acts rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight laid lattices... shifting orbits") sustains under pressure, but stress-induced voice compression is absent during void confrontation, flattening intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "prismatic glow" and "bell metal hammered in deep water" showcase crystalline specificity. Minor simultaneity error ("gust ruffled... light cascaded") deducts 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms reaper trope through "curator of departures" specificity; prism solution risks gimmickry but earns freshness via observatory integration and "scattered light" payoff.</comment>
