<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrator's "desperately jocular" trait drives organic choices (octopus joke, umbrella callback), but secondary characters lack interiority. Milo's reciprocity motivation remains vivid yet slightly abstract. Micro-choices like listing "permission to cry" on the manifest earn the loneliness cure with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "loneliness went to catch another train" crystallizes the shift with palpable cost (Milo's "exhaustion and triumph"). Orientation is flawless by 120 words. Accumulative lens holds as ritual cadence deepens stakes, though one tightening could elevate escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Ivy Station’s overgrowth actively pressures choices (fence gaps, bowing vines) and charges the finale. Moon rock as micro-setting constrains the ritual’s success. "Rusted tracks gleaming like fossils" exemplifies sensory specificity that mirrors internal states without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (curing loneliness) lack sufficient escalation; the ritual succeeds without meaningful resistance. Pressure builds texturally but misses one tightening where options narrow—e.g., if the rock’s hum faltered before alignment. Cost is felt yet not earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "ivy taking root" evolves into "cure travels faster than trains." Final image reweights the moon rock’s "lonesome" state into communal resonance without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete stakes (manifest items like "eyebrow raise").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: narrator’s poetic lens ("telegraph wires singing") modulates under pressure. "Dust like confetti" compresses diction perfectly during laughter. Zero POV drift; rhythmic control elevates the ritual’s cadence shift without elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose propels momentum with zero loops—e.g., "timetable folds, tomorrow negotiates" compresses time economically. Minor register drift ("lunar cold" slightly overwrought) but no closure muddle. Final line’s "schedule impossible departures" delivers crystalline closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms disaster tropes via moon rock logistics. "Reciprocity as key" synthesizes theme through concrete ritual. Risk-taking (crowd gathering as cure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional specificity in "spare batteries" avoids generic loneliness clichés.</comment>
