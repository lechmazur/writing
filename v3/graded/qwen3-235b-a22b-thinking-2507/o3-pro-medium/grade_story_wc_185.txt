<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bottle a gale") and embodied emotion ("pulse drummed softer, as though cushioned by dusk") powerfully drive the closure choice, though minor stock phrasing ("shy tide") slightly dilutes specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("pulse drummed softer") under Accumulative/Textural lens; "hush withered" escalation flaw narrowly avoids -0.8 cap by serving the ritual realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice shard and echo stone constrain choices (crack patterns guide path) and charge the final image ("etched the final map: a single ellipse"); sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects urgency through tactile cartography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ripple-Mark’s agency (ritual of release), but the "second silence" insight risks convenience; cost ("pulse drummed softer") is legible yet slightly abstract for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions ("conjure unseen currents of sound"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "calm was not a destination but a rhythm" with earned ambiguity about sustaining silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost sigils, undeciphered") and rhythmic control under pressure; "spent thunder" to "hammered repose" progression teaches the Accumulative lens flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "ionized songs" slightly violates physical logic; minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" moments prevents 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and sound physics transforms tropes; "examining crack patterns in ice" as divination method feels inevitable yet unprecedented, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
