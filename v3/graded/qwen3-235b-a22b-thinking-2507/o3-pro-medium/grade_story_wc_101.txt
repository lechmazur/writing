<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhessa's embodied "gently persistent" trait manifests concretely when redirecting the last basket to the grandmother, showing value hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction for narrator's underdeveloped internal conflict about border hopes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the napkin donation with bell drawing crystallizes "echo" reciprocity with undeniable conceptual cost (three missing coins replaced). Accumulative lens holds throughout with escalating sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The antique bell constrains choices (weight announces food) and charges the final image (toddlers studying "how quiet could still sparkle"). Terra-cotta arbor supplies patchwork barrels enabling the runs, passing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when sirens trigger nerves, but the grandmother moment is the sole option foreclosure. Escalation under Accumulative lens works, though the sanctions' pressure could deepen tactics earlier beyond scarcity lamps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "echo" reciprocity in the napkin's bell drawing, reweighting prior donations without moralizing. Nearly flawless, but "echoes never pay customs" edges toward thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: narrator's record-keeper focus ("counting tins," "tallying coins") shapes all observation. Rhythmic control peaks in "lighter for reasons beyond mathematics" during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "boiled paper" and "untraceable coins" deliver high density. Final line "gently persistent as the ridge itself" recharges motif with crystalline propulsion, avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through "anonymous donations as echo" mechanics. Specificity of coins in sheet-music and bell-return ritual creates freshness, though "boiled paper" hunger risks trope adjacency.</comment>
