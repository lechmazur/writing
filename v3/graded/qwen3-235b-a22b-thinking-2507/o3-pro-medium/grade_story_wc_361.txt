<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Tren’s jittery fear versus his commitment to coaxing wonder, embodied through drumming fingers and the pendant’s flutter. Micro-choices under pressure (activating the relic via triplet rhythm) earn his closure of letting go, though single-POV limits relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—"leaving him lighter" crystallizes the shift from courier to wonder-coaxer. Accumulative lens holds as aurora-ridgeway density deepens meaning, though the cairn discovery edges toward coincidence without sufficient protagonist agency in the escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices (needing lamplight for activation) and charging the final image with prismatic feathers. Aurora-ridgeway details occasionally drift into ornamental description without altering tactics, slightly diluting pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Tren’s internal conflict (fear of betrayal vs. duty), tightening when the cairn reveals mission failure—but the resolution leans on Ilya’s note rather than protagonist-driven escalation, muting the cost’s agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "wonders hide in plain errands" is dramatized via the pendant’s tavern activation, not stated. Final image (ridgeway as "invitation") reweights the premise with conceptual cost, avoiding moralizing while resonating beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots clicked like nervous metronomes") and rhythmic control shine, compressing under stress ("Snow began..."). Elision of Ilya’s backstory is taught early and pays off in the cairn scene, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffolding—"pupils widened, witnessing ordinary tin bloom into fragile wings" layers action and image. One minor abstraction ("time dilate") in the closure beat prevents 9.0, but rhythm varies purposefully without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms courier trope through specific, grounded choices: the triplet rhythm and pendant’s vibration mechanics feel fresh. Emotional truth in Tren’s anxiety avoids generic templates, though the "absent mentor" motif risks familiarity without its precise integration.</comment>
