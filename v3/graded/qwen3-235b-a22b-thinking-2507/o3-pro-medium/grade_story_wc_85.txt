<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's realization he only "rehearsed the original lie," with embodied regret pressing on ribs. Micro-choices like placing the watch hand into the carving hollow earn the climax, though the brother's name reveal lacks prior setup for full emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Elias speaks the name and the sea cools his nerves, with visible cost in his career abandonment. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the carvings' reconfiguration, though the ledger's sudden appearance slightly strains causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choices (sorting piles, hollow chests) and charges the final image with the healed carving. Sensory details like "phosphorescent algae" and "kelp twine" feel tactile and pressure-driven, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency as he follows the watch hand's tick, with the dominant stake (truth vs. fabrication) narrowing to the ledger's revelation. Cost is unmistakable in his career renunciation, though the cave discovery leans slightly on coincidence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: the hollow chests symbolizing erased lives charge the final image without moralizing. The "sieved hush" resolving into "simple night wind" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of withheld truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("salt air carried a sieved hush") with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Elisions like the brother's backstory are taught early and paid off in the ledger, avoiding head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose excels in texture and concision, but "tempered regret" repetition creates a paraphrase loop near climax. Figurative language remains coherent ("hollows between splinters forming mouths"), though minor scaffold appears in the terrace description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming genealogical fraud into visceral metaphor through driftwood carvings. The specific moral calculus of a guilt-ridden black market genealogist avoids tropes, though the coastal revelation setting feels familiar despite fresh execution.</comment>
