<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "welcomed the ache" versus risking empathy's ossification, with embodied cost in bruised ribs and cold fire petals; minor abstraction in "algebra of yearning" prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the final silence "exactly like being understood" reconfigures the emotional mathematics with conceptual cost, while the Accumulative/Textural lens (density shift from vanishing stars to pinprick reignition) holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop constrains every choice—midnight bread and moth wings become press inputs, while vanishing stars create tangible pressure; final starlight "soaking the type cases" charges closure by making the setting an active participant in the emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the astronomer's warned timeframe ("narrow hour between vanishing stars"), with Dreya's agency crystallizing in the ambiguous final line that directly alters cosmic behavior; cost is unmistakable as stars erase themselves then reignite via her print.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "transposed empathy" becomes physical via the press whispering "impossible primes," culminating in the non-literal answer "silence bloomed that felt exactly like being understood" without moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("gears clicking like cicada wings," "numbers that smelled of pine"), with rhythmic control intensifying during the press operation; minor register drift in "algebra of yearning" avoids penalty as voice modulates under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density falters slightly in "lucid turbulence" repetition and "algebra of yearning" abstraction, but closure beats ("paper exhaled a chord no ear could parse") achieve zero loops with visceral propulsion; figurative language serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of letterpress mechanics with cosmic emotion avoids tropes through specific, verifiable details (halo dust in ink well, integral signs as wedding rings); risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry as the press literally guides stars home.</comment>
