<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Loranth's interior contradiction—archivist compelled to release emotions—drives the climax. Childhood memory informs micro-choice (plucking apple), but motivation lacks sufficient friction until the final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: planting the core resolves the accidental prophecy with conceptual cost (releasing vs. archiving emotions). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density shift at cistern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard isn't backdrop but active constraint—its "sap running with orphaned emotions" directly forces Loranth's choice. Cistern's liquid memory charges the final image, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (archive vs. release emotions) tightens through Loranth's shift from transcription to action. Agency drives escalation, but "accidental prophecy" coincidence slightly dilutes causal weight despite valid conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard's emotional sap and city's unexplained lightness—no moralizing. Final image ("living streets") reweights "archiving" as release without stating the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly: "velvet disquiet" permeates syntax, and dead-language fluency shapes diction ("grooves merely replayed that buried storm"). No POV slippage during high-pressure cistern scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "exhale of a relieved library" crystallizes tone without muddle. One minor loop ("grooves" repetition) in shaving description barely touches closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archival fantasy via emotional ecology—orchard as living archive feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("quince," "copper pennies") avoids abstraction.</comment>
