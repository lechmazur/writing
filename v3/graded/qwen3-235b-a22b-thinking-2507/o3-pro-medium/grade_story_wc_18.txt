<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("feet grounded/eyes wandered") pays off in closure; embodied emotion via synchronized breathing with orchard; micro-choices (welding mirror with breath) reveal values under pressure. Lacks secondary character friction per scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "even exalted, she remained firmly grounded" crystallizes the physical constraint price. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation to fog crystallization. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog and ice constrain every choice (breathing sync, dream capture) and charge the final image ("footsteps left clear windows"). Tool (sextant) evolves from scrap to dream-cage, directly shaping tactics and closure. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing dream) tightens via synchronized breathing deepening into boundary collapse. Agency-driven escalation: Haleh's breathing choices narrow options until the dream's recognition. Cost legible in maintained grounding despite transcendence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "fog crystallized into glittering panes" reweights "erasing boundaries" without moralizing. Final image ("footsteps left clear windows") offers resonant non-literal answer to permeability question. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind strike them as if valley filled with fragile bells") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early (orchard as fragile bells) pays off in closure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("frost steamed from their scars in synchronized breathing" does triple duty). Minor coherence risk in "fog itself looked like torn wallpaper" (mixed metaphor) prevents 9.0. Propulsion flawless through climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dream-capture trope through mirror maker's tactile logic. Specificity ("velvet shards," "plum blossoms not bloomed for 300 years") creates freshness. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
