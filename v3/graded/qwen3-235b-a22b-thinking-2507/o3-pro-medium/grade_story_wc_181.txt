<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "brightened disquiet" and embodied cost of frost rewriting lungs; "diagnostic label-speak" avoided through concrete orchard metaphors during peak crisis. Final choice to "become the teller" earned by bathroom breakthrough’s causal chain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "frost rewrote him" and "lungs overflowing" make conceptual price legible. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through orchard’s evolving light until final reconfiguration where silence inherits him.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cameo shell constrains choices (refuses keys) and charges closure ("tucked back uncertain whether gained or lost"). Orchard evolves causally: roots whisper his name only after ritual, proving micro-setting’s tactical role in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when curator realizes "story had not yet been lived," narrowing options to irreversible participation. Escalation driven by agency ("become the teller") with visible cost in frost rewriting him—a felt price charging the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: apprentice’s future tears anchor present cost, avoiding moralizing. Final image "silence had inherited him" reweights opening query without stated moral, earning resonance through the cameo’s unreadable runes vanishing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "almond-sized stars drip light" (botanical lens); rhythmic control under pressure evident in bathroom scene’s fragmented syntax ("The mirror, being unhelpful, dripped"). Elision taught early (bathroom steam fogging universe) paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops—each line advances density: "petals shimmered translucent green" sets orchard’s stakes while "frost rewrote him" delivers cost. Final line recharges opening query with CR weight, avoiding figurative muddle even during high-stress inhalation scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tropes transformed through specific mechanics: forbidden knowledge demands irreversible "folding of self," not mere discovery. Astral orchard’s light-pollination metaphor synthesizes narrative germination uniquely, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
