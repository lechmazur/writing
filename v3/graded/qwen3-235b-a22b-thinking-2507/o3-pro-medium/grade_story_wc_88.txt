<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("whitewashed crimes") and embodied empathy via lake-water synapses earn change, but "empathy bankrupt" is diagnostic label-speak in high-pressure beat, triggering rubric-mandated -0.5 deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("squeezed the baseball until its glow pulsed like a second heart"), but "jaded wonder cracked" slightly abstracts the final emotional shift, preventing 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Baseball (micro-setting) constrains choice (prying hatch) and charges closure via glow; bioluminescent lake forces vision trade-offs, meeting 9+ gate requirement with electric-root imagery charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via lake visions deepens dominant stake (empathy vs. relapse), but "impossible pitch" metaphor over-explains the empathy leap, slightly diluting the protagonist-driven cost legibility in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (drinking lake water, coaching vision), but "jaded wonder cracked into something softer" edges toward emotional arithmetic, weakening the non-literal resonance demanded for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lace forged from engine grease," "tasting sparks") and rhythmic compression under stress ("Arsonist, data thief, empathy bankrupt") showcase mastery, with lyric elision taught early and paid off in the dawn headline.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters in closure beat: "jaded wonder cracked" repeats the phrase with minimal variation, creating a paraphrase loop in peak pressure that dulls the final image per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms memory-wipe tropes through specific, lived details (time-traveler baseball, bioluminescent lake mechanics); risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
