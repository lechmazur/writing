<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s prophetic failure creates authentic internal conflict, but her pivot to realization lacks a visible micro-choice before the climax. Arden’s embodied motivation to share wonder lands with felt cost, though Mara’s shift feels slightly rushed without prior behavioral groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("wonder thrives by being shared") delivers undeniable conceptual cost through Arden’s relinquishment. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density intensifies to crystallize stakes without causality breaks, anchored by the chamber’s luminous-shadow paradox.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cave pearl constrains every choice, from Mara’s failed prophecy to Arden’s final placement. Its reweighted meaning in the closure ("cautious glow") charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making environment inseparable from thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure: the cave’s sentient responses narrow options until Arden’s choice to share the pearl forecloses ownership. Cost is unmistakable in "wonder thrives by being shared," though escalation relies more on sensory accumulation than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Arden’s action—not statement—when setting the pearl down reweights "magnifying magic" as communal witness. Avoids moralizing; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of ownership versus sharing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dual focalization is clean with section-like shifts (Arden’s attraction vs. Mara’s despair), and perceptual signatures shine ("vein of light" for Mara). Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly disrupts voice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through dense imagery like "colors rang, scents chimed." One borderline mixed metaphor ("unseen forces... like children determined to misbehave") risks muddle but serves the "steadily unpredictable" theme without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms the "pilgrim" trope through specific emotional calculus: Mara’s failed clairvoyance and Arden’s witness-centric magic feel inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling the 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
