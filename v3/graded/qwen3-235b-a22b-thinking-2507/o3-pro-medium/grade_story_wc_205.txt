<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Velen's contradictory impulses—revolutionary fervor vs. burnished sorrow—drive his experiment; "poetically inclined heart" manifests in shard interpretation, not labels. Final choice to build "postponed revolutions" earns closure through prior causality, though internal conflict could deepen during chronostorm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "varnish of burnished sorrow" reconfigures victory into responsibility. Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors time/setting by line 3. Slight over-explanation in "constructing a future" edges toward thematic echo but avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time-as-bronze-smoke setting constrains every choice (e.g., velvet draping during storm) and charges the final image. "Rusted banners" motif evolves from metaphor to embodied cost, though asteroid architecture remains decorative beyond Mirror Grotto.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Velen's agency: chronostorm experiment narrows options from debate to tangible proof. Dominant stake (proving shard's meaning) tightens via storm mechanics, but Metron faction's absence weakens pressure; cost ("bronze smoke" victory taste) legible yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shatter and begin anew" reprise: final image reweights revolution as perpetual process without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "confessions" phrasing, but secondary "emancipatory contours" stake drifts unresolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted of rust," "scribbling lines in plaster dust") persists under pressure. Voice modulates from lyrical to urgent during translation; "ice under a torch" maintains character-specific texture without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "molten amber" time seepage does triple duty (atmosphere/stakes/motif). Minor overwriting in "choir of ghosts reciting eulogies" risks figurative muddle but pays off in closure image. Final line’s "break neither" achieves rhythmic precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: time-visibility transforms archaeological dispute into tactile revolution metaphor. "Burnished sorrow" reframes defeat as fuel—fresh inflection where shard’s "stern permission" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric chronostorm) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
