<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (leaving stroke missing) but secondary pressure absent; emotional progression avoids tidiness yet flaw integration lacks one visible mistake compounding before closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("Absence, too, can roar") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by line 3, cost proof undeniable in final carving choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight constrains time pressure (kettle boil) and charges closure ("drops like commas"); ash wood actively transforms from blank to breathing entity, shaping every major beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency through crystallized time deepens the "contain loss" stake; cost crystallizes in deliberate incompleteness, though one visible tactical shift (beyond emotional) would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash grain's transformation ("from circus to loft" trail), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "here and gone" with conceptual cost (absence as roar) without stating insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless ("steam paused in the throat of the kettle"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with taught lyrical elision; no head-hopping, voice modulates from tremulous to rust-hued calm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic and still" exemplifies density without muddle; final paragraph's triple "shaping" repetition purposefully charges closure with no figurative drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through circus-carving synthesis; "roar tunneled into wood" feels inevitable yet fresh, with bold risk-taking (frozen time) heightening emotional stakes coherently.</comment>
