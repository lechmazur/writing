<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rescue vs. abandonment) manifest physically in the "third line" stitching choice, with visible cost in shared memory labor; fatigue-taped smile embodies emotional contradiction without labels; backstory anchor ("accident") subtly alters present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: ink lily pads requiring spoken storytelling to solidify memory; accumulative lens holds through density increase (murals → bioluminescent names); orientation anchored by 80 words ("abandoned carnival ship drifting in a foggy bay").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ship setting actively constrains choices: seawater blossoms into ink lily pads that "support only remembered weight," directly charging the final image; micro-setting (emerald card) evolves from compass to promise, shaping the exit-stitching tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing brother from garden-prison) tightens when emerald flare dissolves painted specters into "seedlike motes," forcing the narrator's agency in stitching the "third line" exit; cost is unmistakable in "forcing us to keep telling our story aloud" during the lily-pad crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bioluminescent names "rustling like leaves made of syllables," avoiding moralizing; "unkindled solace" concept reweights sorrow's role in the garden's logic; final line ("rewriting until it finally became true") offers resonant non-literal answer to memory's burden without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "oxymoron had followed me since childhood" and "calliope whispers... twisting into voices"; rhythm modulates from fragmented panic ("I stepped aboard") to flowing resolution ("warmth spread between us like a promise"); no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density in "seawater surged in, but instead of drowning us it blossomed into lily pads of shimmering ink"; final image avoids figurative muddle while charging closure; "blissfully aberrant" repetition slightly dilutes momentum but doesn't touch closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms carnival ship trope through memory-as-physical-constraint (ink lily pads requiring spoken story); "chimera twin discoverer" concept synthesizes sibling obligation and narrative repair; risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
