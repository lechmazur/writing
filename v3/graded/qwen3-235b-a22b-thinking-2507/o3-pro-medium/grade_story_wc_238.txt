<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "I advise through metaphors" yet speaking plainly to Dulio; embodied regret in "fingers found the silent piano" avoids therapy-speak. Minor flaw: Mara Luz's backstory feels slightly told despite emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in "lighter but still not whole" and the abandoned bottle; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the orchard's hush. Cost proof clear in final lilac image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perfume bottle charges the final image (stump placement) while constraining choices; orchard's "waiting branches" mirror emotional stakes. Sawdust "gusted like early snow" perfectly embodies loss without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard deadline creates visceral pressure ("saws revved, then stalled"), narrowing options to one imperfect miracle. Cost legible in Dulio's incomplete release and Marisol's nerve expenditure, though secondary stake could deepen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (bottle placement), not moralizing; final line avoids sentimentality by rooting "absolution" in persistent lilac scent. "Fragile channel" skirts thematic echo but stays character-bound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gauze" fog, "nervous applause" paper) with rhythmic control in "electric possession." No POV slippage; compression taught early via fragmented clauses during coil activation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "accidental sharps of lightning" exemplifies high-density imagery. Slight register drift in "fragile channel for whatever absolution remains" barely touches closure but avoids artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost story" trope through sheet-music archive specificity; "imperfect miracles" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking (Tesla coil exorcism) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
