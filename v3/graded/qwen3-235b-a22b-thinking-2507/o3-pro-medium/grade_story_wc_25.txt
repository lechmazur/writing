<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Marlin's "calculated spontaneity" ethos, but security patrol pressure lacks depth as secondary pressure; micro-choices like vent-whisper redirection earn high marks yet the cost (professional risk) remains abstract despite concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "letting mysteries rest" crystallizes their stance with cost shown through Marlin modifying the radio into evidence, while the Accumulative/Textural lens (pressure via whisper density) holds flawlessly to the final line reweighting silence as "loudest song."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The zodiac coin constrains choice (key insertion) and charges the final image as "mute trophy humming with auroral charge," transforming from object to thematic vessel; container maze’s shifting auroral reflections actively guide navigation under geomagnetic pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Marlin’s radio modification (tangible cost: sacrificed tool for evidence), but patrol evasion relies slightly on coincidence; escalation through whispered network’s "loudest hush" discovery reweights silence as weapon under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image—"silence, practiced well, is the loudest song"—resonates non-literally by reweighting the whisper challenge into earned wisdom; thematic complexity avoids moralizing through embodied action (ripping speaker, delivering coin) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("walks resolved into treble clef," "lamp flickered like capillaries") persists under stress; voice modulates perfectly from hushed whispers to Marlin’s rare raised voice, with no head-hopping in tight single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "corrugated floor, proof she listened" is minor filter-verb drift but doesn’t dull climax; lyrical density ("phosphorescent spray paint," "limping drum") enhances rather than obscures the vent-whisper payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of port-worker realism with lyrical mysticism (zodiac coin as "starlight and tarnish"); risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via whisper-network’s tangible stakes, avoiding gimmickry through Marlin’s occupational specificity.</comment>
