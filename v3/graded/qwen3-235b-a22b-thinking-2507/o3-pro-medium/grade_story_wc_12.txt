<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: priest kneels yet actively layers chants, uses rhetorical devices as weapons while gathering loops like physical objects. Micro-choices reveal value hierarchy when offering the palette—absolution as admission of emptiness. No label-speak; "tasting dust, memory, and eternity" embodies emotion concretely. Girl's "unraveled stillness" manifests physically through ribcage tremors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: demon's sigh and escape crystallize options with felt cost—"victory would echo only until another heart grew careless." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; each loop tightens pressure until demon's "disgust fermented into reluctant self-awareness." Anchor established by word 15 with "cracked marble of the dimensional anchor," avoiding orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor constrains choice by preventing reality-skipping, its pulse reacting to syllables. Palette's "midnight pigment" evolves from orbiting object to evaporating flare signaling "distant hungers." Crucially, the cracked marble and unraveled stillness charge the final image of priest stepping into dawn "carrying quiet threads glowing at his heel"—environment directly shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through priest's agency: "illuminate hidden assumptions" versus demon exploiting contradictions. Pressure escalates as rhetorical devices force demon to "watch itself" via looped replays, narrowing options until "fractures spidered across borrowed confidence." Cost is legible in priest's awareness that truth "seldom survives unaccompanied," altering his persistent pilgrimage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: single-color palette exposing arguments as hollow, loops becoming "cathedral of hush." Final image of "dampness as a kind of birth" resonates without moralizing. Avoids false balance—the demon's sarcasm fails against monotone truth. Earned wisdom arises from "standing in rain yet never getting wet," reweighting prior material through specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tasting dust, memory, and eternity," "congregation of one" silence. Rhythm modulates from polysyndeton ("Anaphora rolled over polysyndeton") to fragmented urgency ("Colorlessness exposed..."). Under peak stress, diction compresses without losing texture—"disgust fermented into reluctant self-awareness" shows rhythmic control. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during exorcism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero synonym loops or scaffold; every image serves pressure ("fractures spidered across borrowed confidence"). Cadence shifts organically: slow inhalation ("tasting dust...") versus staccato interrogation ("Why cling to borrowed flesh?"). Figurative language stays coherent—"midnight pigment" never contradicts physical logic. Final line's "road... cadence... promise" resolves with textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism tropes through specific details: loop pedals as ritual tools, demon fidgeting "like courtroom witness." Emotional truth in priest's "janitor of meaning" self-view avoids abstraction. "Unraveled stillness" as tactile "severed harp strings" resists quirky ornament. Risk-taking heightens stakes—rhetorical devices as weapons—without gimmickry, though "decorates with silence" lacks full integration.</comment>
