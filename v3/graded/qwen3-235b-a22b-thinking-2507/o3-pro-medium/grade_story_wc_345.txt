<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (trembling arms from magnitude not weight) and contradictory impulses (fear pressing thorns into optimism). Serafin’s altruism drives pivotal actions but "altruistic" label risks telling; closure choice earned through prior chalk-led unity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (bruised yet blooming, thorns in optimism) under Accumulative lens. Escalation via density (pulley gardens, magnetite sutures) tightens options, though nebula’s conduit role emerges late. Final bell strike reconfigures vibration into promise with sap/ozone hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s floating arches actively constrain repair tactics (vines stitching cracks, magnetite sutures), while the bell’s copper mottle charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy excels (peyote chalk vibrating like heartbeats, sound tasting of sap/ozone), with recurring pears and chalk dust charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency: ringing bell reexamines ambitions, chalk messages mobilize neighbors. Cost is legible in "fear pressing thorns into optimism" and the final "bruised yet blooming" state. Tightening via collective tactics (ropes, drones, sigils) narrows options before arches shatter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fragile kinship proved our strongest shield" reframed by chalk-dusted faces ringing the bell. Final image ("bruised yet blooming") offers non-literal answer to collective action without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "altruistic" descriptor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("latticed shadows," "sound like butterfly wings") modulates with pressure. Prose rhythm accelerates during bell strike ("rippled through orchards, markets, mining rigs") then breathes in repairs. No head-hopping; Serafin’s voice filtered through chalk maintains POV consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("vines to stitch across cracks," "ore’s hidden claws grip stone"). Final line’s "bruised yet blooming" crystallizes closure without muddle. Minor register drift in "reexamine every solitary ambition" slightly over-articulates under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms colony tropes through orchard-specific stakes (ripening pears during crisis) and chalk-dust mobilization. "Brambled hope" sigils feel earned, not quirky. Risk-taking in ghost-as-logistics-manager heightens stakes, though altruistic ghost archetype lacks full novelty.</comment>
