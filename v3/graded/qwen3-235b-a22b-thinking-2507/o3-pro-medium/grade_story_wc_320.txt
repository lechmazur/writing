<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in discarding assumptions while clinging to mentor's wisdom; embodied cost in the spent fragment's warmth. No second character, but micro-choices under pressure (crank glider launch, dismantling receiver) reveal values with felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands perfectly: spent fragment in pocket signals irreversible cost while new river glimmers. Lunar perigee deadline creates tight pressure under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legible in "warm glass" and "equilibrium demanded motion" beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gorge wind and pylon moss constrain choices (glider landing, ear-to-soil tuning); the fragment's brass geometry charges the final image. Recurring "serenely electric" trait evolves from scarf to spine tremor to spent artifact, directly shaping the repurposing climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("threatening her homeland with silence") and tighten through lunar deadline pressure. Mara's agency drives escalation: discarding assumptions enables the prismatic refracting that transforms the gorge. Cost is visceral in the fragment's depleted charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "finding the beginning in every ending" embodied in repurposing the fragment to birth a river. Final image ("whistling a brand-new overture") offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the "shard of hush" through earned transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hush so sharp it felt like glass sliding between heartbeats") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical moonlight to urgent glider descent; no head-hopping despite single POV. "Serenely electric" refrain taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serenely electric" avoids cliché through evolving context (scarf → tremor → spent charge). Final line ("whistling a brand-new overture") recharges opening moonlight with propulsion. Minor density risk in "prismatic syllables" balanced by payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio tower decay and celestial mechanics avoids genre tropes. "Hollywood star fragment" transformed into compass needle reconfigures cosmic stakes through specific, verifiable detail. Risk-taking heightens coherence: lyrical physics ("ridges rose, collapsed, and rose again") charges the closure.</comment>
