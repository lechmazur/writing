<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (hesitating at lagoon's edge) and embodied emotion ("knees shaking"), but "sensibly eccentric" label slightly flattens motivation without visible tradeoffs early on. Final renunciation of bottled scents earns closure with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: stepping through the question-mark doorway crystallizes the cost of embracing uncertainty, with bottled memories releasing as irreversible consequence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory escalation to the final image's undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subterranean lagoon actively constrains choices (compass-guided navigation, mist obscuring vision) and charges the final image—spilled-glass water reflecting "upside-down leviathan" directly enables the resonant hush payoff. Every detail serves urgency, like quartz veins intensifying petrichor scent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens: the dominant drive to find "where explanations fail" tightens via sensory accumulation (compass vibrations, glowing constellations), with cost crystallizing when bottled memories shatter. Agency-driven deepening lacks only one tangible mid-beat price (e.g., lost tool) to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—bottling scents versus inhaling "impossible sum"—with the doorway-shaped question mark offering a non-literal answer that reweights the entire premise. Zero thematic echo; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless ("damp rust, perfect bait for a petrichor collector"), with syntax compressing under stress ("Water drips in steady ticks"). Slight register drift in "psychometry reading" (academic diction) barely tempers rhythmic control during the vision sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("green glow beyond black water") propels momentum. One near-miss: "thrums" and "pulsate" risk synonym churn for compass vibration, but patterned repetition serves Accumulative lens without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes via sensory specificity (petrichor as motivation), with the lagoon's "submerged constellations" reconfiguring bottled scents organically. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
