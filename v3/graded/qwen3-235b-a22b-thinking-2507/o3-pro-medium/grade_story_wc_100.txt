<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elias' "inadvertently stubborn" trait manifests concretely in his refusal to seal the box and final choice to stay; embodied emotion ("singed wick willingly drowning itself") avoids diagnostic labels while showing contradictory impulses between duty and compulsion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably with cost in "something living had to remain behind"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through clicking escalation and light gathering, with orientation anchored by "cracked harbor stones" and "weary undertaker" within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The broken lens constrains every major choice—from tracing fractures to positioning on the plinth—and charges the final image as Elias watches through it; bioluminescent script and coral-encrusted tomes reflect his undertaker's perception of grief-made architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (silencing distress signals) tightens through Elias' agency: his ritual recitation narrows options to revitalization, with the irreversible cost of remaining behind crystallizing the final stance under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the library of ignored pleas—without moralizing; the final image of lamps dimming "like breath settling into bones" offers resonant, non-literal resolution to the central question of rest, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("burial records could wait; the dead already knew patience") modulates rhythm with pressure; syntactic compression during the ritual ("Light gathered from impossible directions") reflects Elias' focused state without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose like "moonlight threaded through clouds, illuminating a stairwell of air" multiplies meaning without figurative muddle, and final image "calm no storm could exhume" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the "keeper of lost things" trope through specific grief architecture; the underwater library’s emergence from ignored distress signals feels inevitable in hindsight, with octopus librarians heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
