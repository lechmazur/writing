<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (righteous anger vs. needed calm) manifest physically in "heart drumming" and micro-choices like humming at foam hollows; closure's cost is Marella's emotional labor to modulate tone, earned through the cicada's dual-vision revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Marella's "gentle tide" vow crystallizes after witnessing her shattering words' consequence; Accumulative lens holds through tidal rhythm accumulating pressure until the cicada's song reconfigures time's texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Grotto floor's "cool grain" and tidal hush directly constrain choices (timing strides to wave pauses), charging the final image where the island "holds breath"; sensory specificity ("stitched by invisible kelp threads") embodies urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Marella's agency when foresight reveals her own destructive words as the obstacle; cost is the visceral restraint required to shift from "storm surge" to "gentle tide," narrowing options to one path with emotional labor as price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the corrugated time metaphor made tangible by the cicada's song; final image ("night resumed its patient discourse on becoming") reweights transition periods as cosmic hesitations without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in marine-specific diction ("bioluminescent surf," "tides' minor key"); dialogue carries subtext through rhythmic restraint ("across the pause"), with syntax compressing under pressure ("She foresaw Quillon confronting...") without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "memory of garden wind trapped in a shell" achieves high density without muddle; only minor deduction for "heart drumming" bordering cliché, though mitigated by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Corrugated time" transforms a familiar trope through tidal-pool chronicler's embodied logic; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently, with specificity ("thumb-sized jade cicada") anchoring universality.</comment>
