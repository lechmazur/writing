<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Archivist's "combative tenderness" manifests in backward retreat forcing Harl into uncertain footing, but exile's emotional core lacks contradictory impulses; Rafe's "unshelled seeds" eyes show embodied fragility without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via the stilled swing outside contrasting "pages and people kept learning to sway back without breaking," with visible cost in "promises kept" and enduring mentorship; slight late stake testing for reversible exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Afternoon shadow functions as micro-setting: pocketed daily, weaponized at climax, and its absence enables Rafe's dust circle—constraining choices and charging the final tea ritual where "dusk reddened the rafters."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Harl's footsteps interrupt tea-leaf geometry, forcing Rafe's circle-drawing as agency under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "promises kept" but secondary pressure from playground swing remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tea-leaf "triangles of bitterness" and "ellipses of delay" becoming embodied resilience tools; final image rejects tidy resolution by showing "sway back without breaking" as ongoing labor, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "margins like braille for inquisitive light" and "wax the color of dried forgiveness"; syntactic compression during confrontation ("Light dimmed as though the sun had been edited out") heightens pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "improbable ellipses of delay" risks slight overwriting but pays off in Rafe's dust-circle theorem—figurative language earns its place through closure linkage and rhythmic propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shard-mirror exile transforms tropes via tea-leaf geometry as emotional cartography; "combative tenderness" avoids quirkiness by driving the backward-retreat tactic against Harl, though playground swing motif lacks full integration.</comment>
