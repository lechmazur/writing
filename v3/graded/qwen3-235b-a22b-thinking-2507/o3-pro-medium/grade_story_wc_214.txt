<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Janus's interiority shines through embodied contradiction: "Protocol ordered him to seal the leak, but wonder drew him closer." His childhood fragility ("hide behind strength that was faked") credibly motivates the mending choice with visible cost in "humble labor seemed kin to cosmic erosion." No diagnostic labels mar peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "feeling his own fissures knit" crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("console alarms quieted, replaced by a heartbeat hum"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure intensifies through density ("radiance hummed... painting spirals") not causal turns. Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The broom functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: "broom traced circles" mends the glass, then "broom's soft rhythms" answer the universe. Sensory details ("saffron light flooded... like molten dawn") reflect Janus's priorities without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning through vulnerability) tightens when protocol clashes with wonder, narrowing options to mending. Agency drives escalation: tracing stars reveals "meteor tears for decades," making his labor "kin to cosmic erosion" with felt cost in "fissures knit." Accumulative pressure reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: mending glass becomes "strength is sometimes a patch of vulnerability polished to brilliance." Final image ("universe... answered with a hush of primal elegance") reweights vulnerability without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through Janus's logs "sensed quiet music."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dusting darkness for forgotten meanings" filters all observation. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short staccato ("Alarm brass gonged") for crisis, lyrical flow for mending. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("radiance hummed through the split, painting spirals") advances plot and theme. Figurative language enhances clarity in peak beats: "broom... as a conductor guiding unseen orchestras" charges closure. Final line recharges "primal elegance" motif perfectly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor trope transformed through specific details (quill-laser tracing, dust from filtration mesh). Emotional truth in linking cosmic erosion to personal fragility avoids safety middle. "Flourishing stillness" concept feels fresh via Janus's logs "sensed quiet music" decades later.</comment>
