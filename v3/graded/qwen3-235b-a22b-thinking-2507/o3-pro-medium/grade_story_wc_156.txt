<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Ada's private motive echoes the garden's demand, revealing her core conflict through action ("loose the city's certainty"). Embodied emotion avoids labels: her shiver upon hearing "Deep in your waiting" concretizes the uncanny. No therapy-speak; flaws manifest in her calculated risk-taking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Ada steps beneath the archway listening for the next question, crystallizing the cost (citywide loss of certainty) and reconfiguring options (curiosity as perpetual motion). Accumulative lens holds throughout—density of sound interactions tightens pressure until the mist-shimmering climax reweights the garden's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden’s micro-setting constrains every choice: the throat-shaped alcove directs coin placement, benches shudder under tuned mallets, and hedges sculpt echoes. Sensory hierarchy reflects Ada’s priorities—pigment molecules resonate with frequencies, not tourist details. Final murals erupting on clouds charge the closure image with environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative deepening: pressure intensifies as Ada progresses from waking paint (glazes + hums) to stone (mallets) to silence (held breath), each layer narrowing options toward the solstice concert’s existential cost. The garden’s demand ("Loose the city’s certainty") makes stakes visceral when citizens flock to "taste the interval before answers," proving conceptual cost through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: shifting murals defy naming, making "curiosity over certainty" inescapable without moralizing. The final image—Ada listening for the next question while new rooms open—resonates as a non-literal answer to "Where do echoes sleep?" Earned wisdom arises from her childhood riddles exhaled into the mist, avoiding abstract sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: short, rhythmic phrases ("She scraped decayed varnish, humming scales") during high-stakes work contrast with lyrical flow in the awakening sequence. Perceptual signature is Ada-specific—she notices molecular resonance, not weather. No POV drift; syntax mirrors her focused state ("Each brushstroke accompanied a corresponding hum").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; propulsion through layered verbs: echoes "ricocheted," "blossomed," "shimmered." Figurative language ("polite gremlins," "moss like blankets") serves immediacy without muddle. Final line ("listened for the following question") recharges the opening commission with crystalline rhythm. Minor register risk in "calcify into certainties" but justified by character voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms mural-restoration tropes through sonic specificity: "living murals of curiosity" aren’t whimsy but a direct consequence of Ada’s method. Emotional truth in citizens hearing "their own hearts reflected" avoids generic wonder. The hobo nickel’s goggles-and-grin Liberty reprises with charged specificity, making the premise inseparable from Ada’s heritage and the garden’s demand.</comment>
