<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cool head" vs "hungering fisher soul") manifests in climax choice, but "transliterates emotions" trait lacks embodied tradeoffs; diagnostic insight ("heard gratitude") edges toward label-speak without sufficient physical cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("cages... bruise wings") under Accumulative/Textural lens; constellations' warning crystallizes stance with visible stakes, though "bruise wings" phrasing slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices: vibrations pool like dew, ultraviolet petals shed when spiked; rail spike as micro-setting directly charges closure by pinning/releasing vibrations, making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully via constellations' sky-sentence warning ("release or be unmade"), narrowing Arlen's options under Accumulative pressure; cost is conceptual (silence as living creature) but agency leans slightly passive as external forces drive escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete action: "cages, however gentle, still bruise wings" reweights capture premise without moralizing; final "compass humming toward unspoken shores" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question of possession vs release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vibration-nets," "star-shivers") and rhythmic control shine, but "transliterates emotions" phrasing breaks POV plausibility with clinical diction during high-pressure capture attempt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density, but "hush-wind scraped chords... way bark is peeled" strains metaphor logic in peak beat; minor coherence flaw dilutes pressure despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fishing/silence physics feels inevitable, rail spike elevates trope through vibration mechanics; slightly conventional anchor object prevents higher score despite bold sound-garden premise.</comment>
