<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "unfinished y" mirroring narrator's silence; choices reveal values through concrete actions (backpack placement, acceptance) with visible cost in withheld languages. No stock phrasing, though internal conflict could deepen slightly pre-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when narrator accepts apprenticeship, reconfiguring "languages unsaid" into understanding "incomplete syllables" with felt cost in the burned letter's echo. Orientation perfect; Accumulative lens held through density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber pavilion constrains choice (shelter from cold) and charges final image ("honeyed glow now inside me"). Dew/moon details mirror emotional thawing; micro-setting elevates beyond description to pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating unsaid languages) tightens via sentinel's storm translation offer, narrowing narrator's options with visible cost in "languages never dared speak." Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of "destined mismatches" emerges purely through particulars (clay/limestone, rot/bloom), culminating in resonant final image ("colors grapes dream in") that reweights silence without moralizing. Avoids all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic details ("breath clouds like spilt milk"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure. Minor deduction for "unsaid" abstraction, but quickly grounded by visceral metaphors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "rot becoming bloom" and "ash carry flavor" show high density. "Jarred honey" metaphor maintains coherence. Only debatable point: "spilt milk" risks cliché but redeemed by concrete context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise mentor" trope through vineyard-specific metaphors ("soil to sky" letter); emotional truth in "ash carry flavor" avoids abstraction. Risk of poetic abstraction pays off with concrete closure.</comment>
