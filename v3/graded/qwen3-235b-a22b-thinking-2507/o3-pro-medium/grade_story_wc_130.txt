<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: "refused to abandon the problem" while seeking "subtle adjustments," culminating in the earned endurance of ambiguous loss as a "continuing function" with visible cost in "measurable curve, still painful yet describable."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "loss does not subtract; it hovers" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost, foreclosing mathematical resolution for rhythmic acceptance. Orientation anchors by line 12 ("cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cavern orchard actively constrains choices—drip intervals dictate the glass eyes' placement and lute testing—while the micro-setting (mosaic stone) directly charges closure via "Hope Fractions" irrigation. Final mist "carrying seeds" reweights growth against grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Eridian's agency: translating symbols → lute testing → irrigation adjustment, each narrowing options toward the realization that ambiguous loss requires "rhythm instead of closure." Cost is visceral in "Lio's absence contract[ing] from a yawning wound."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through embodied action: equations becoming lullabies, tears answered by fruit. Final line—"equations can sound like lullabies when solved by listening"—resonantly reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is mathematically precise yet lyrical ("pulsed quietly, like pocket hearths," "drip intervals"). Compression ("After the orchard grows silent...") is taught early and pays off in closure’s rhythmic revelation, with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or theme ("stalactite droplets echo like patient metronomes"). Only microscopic flaw: "patient sentinels" slightly overwrites the glass eyes' closure image without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via mathematical framing—"Hope Fractions," "grief speaking with growth"—with emotional specificity in "sorrow without letting it leak despair." The orchard’s sentient rhythm feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
