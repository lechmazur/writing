<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Mara’s near-bell-tug versus disciplined data focus; her humility-driven curiosity compels the switch decision with felt cost in "silence now seemed the bigger lie."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands via Decisive Change—flipping the switch validates her gamble as hailstones hit—with causal escalation tightening options via the pressure graph’s plunge after the green light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The anemometer’s quartz petals constrain Mara’s choice and charge the final harmony; "static on her skin" and copper leads fuse environment with embodied urgency beyond mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("valley towns caught unready"/"false alarms"), escalating through the pressure graph’s betrayal; Mara’s agency in the balanced chord choice carries visceral cost via mule drivers scrambling for cover.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the anemometer’s "quiet harmony," avoiding moralizing; the bell’s ceremonial tug reweights "listening over noise" as earned wisdom without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature gleams in microclimate tracking ("ice crystals bent sound"); rhythmic compression under pressure ("Clouds churned beneath like gray oceans") avoids uniformity while teaching its lyrical pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line propels plot or character; "trembling note flickered... memory of thunder" delivers high-density imagery without muddle during the climactic sensor activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the "warning system" trope via "balanced chord" harmonizing with the storm; specificity of quartz-brass anemometer and solstice hush makes the synthesis feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
