<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marietta's "palms up" weighing of trust versus fear, with embodied choices like burning ledgers showing earned endurance. Minor deduction for "bloom and wither" abstraction edging toward therapy-speak in the climax, slightly softening the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: releasing the pigeon while burning old identities crystallizes the trust dilemma with visible cost (ash on cages). Accumulative lens holds throughout dust-pattern accumulation, with cost legible in "gray snow" settling on unused cages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains every choice—from lavender straw runways to stove-fed ledgers—and charges the closure via ash-covered cages. Meteorite's placement under skylight makes environment actively shape tactics, exceeding 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation through Marietta's agency: accepting the stone reopens scars, sketching dust trajectories tightens stakes, and pigeon release forces trade-off between safety and preserving song. Cost unmistakable in burning her past selves ("old names curl into smoke").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through dust-as-score and paper-trail motifs, resolving in the final line's non-literal answer: "trust is the moment you release the bird anyway." Avoids moralizing while reweighting exile through "bloom and wither" balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mapping dust motes as silent score," with rhythmic control deepening under pressure ("She hesitated until..."). No head-hopping; lexicon stays within Marietta's courier-musician lexicon even during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Dust danced where the late spring sun pierced the cracked skylight" anchors voice/stakes immediately. Minor deduction for "fragile bond" slightly generic phrasing in high-stakes pigeon-release beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pigeon courier + meteorite song avoids tropes via specific details (Huygens Plateau, lavender straw). Emotional truth in "trust is not a ledger column" transforms familiar exile narrative without gimmickry.</comment>
