<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Levin’s "shielded openness" and shift from fear to empathy, but micro-choices lack sufficient embodied struggle under pressure; the pivotal corridor decision feels under-earned despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: the whispered chapel redefined as "a practice" with felt cost in replacing the grate, under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density (frescoes, tape, wind) reweights mapping’s purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rain-scoured vault and torn map actively constrain choices (e.g., algae panel concealment), charging the final image where "torn parchment and unbroken sky" conjoin; micro-setting drives the entire arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Levin’s epistemological shift, but pressure lacks tangible escalation—no meaningful cost beyond abstract realization, weakening the "felt cost" requirement despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "interpret silence with empathy" to the final practice of attentive mapping; no moralizing, just the moonlit conjoining of torn map and sky reweighting cartography’s essence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wounded chart," "wind from uncharted hills") modulates perfectly with tension, though minor register drift occurs in technical terms like "magnetic tape" without POV filtration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "water droplets drummed a steady heartbeat" exemplifies rhythmic control. Only deduction: "practiced empathy" slightly over-tells where embodied action could deepen the beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography as listening transforms familiar archival tropes, but risks hedging by avoiding concrete stakes—e.g., the bronze cylinder’s contents remain unplayed, sacrificing visceral payoff for poetic abstraction.</comment>
