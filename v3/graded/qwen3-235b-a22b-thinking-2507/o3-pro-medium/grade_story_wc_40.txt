<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (arranging folios, touching crystal) reveals Orrin's priorities; "weathered innocence" manifests in his weary steadiness when addressing tribunal. Micro-choices under pressure—offering crystal instead of testimony—earn closure with visible cost (publishers' fearful uncertainty). Limited internal contradiction slightly dampens 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: crystal's refraction onto folios crystallizes language's evolution with conceptual cost ("uncertain whether to celebrate or fear"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density (hush snapping → footsteps) without causal breaks. Cost proof evident in "hush held sovereign... patient breathing of futures."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal functions as micro-setting that charges closure: refracting light paints "moving roots on ceiling," directly constraining Orrin's method and reweighting language's growth. Library details (shutters, floorboards) anchor urgency—dawn light enables refraction critical to resolution. Sensory selection mirrors Orrin's focus on sound/chimes during high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("map unseen botany before chaos disguises it") tightens via Orrin's agency: tribunal's arrival forces demonstration instead of testimony. Escalation under Accumulative lens—hush intensifying to "inaudible roots"—reweights stakes through density shift. Conceptual cost legible in publishers' retreat and single directive: "continue, though dictionaries be complete."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Words would now sprout rather than be forged" evolves into "seedlings requesting light." Final image (roots on ceiling) answers central question without moralizing—closure reweights language as living architecture. Avoids Thematic Echo; publishers' "rustling like undergrowth" implies organic consequences without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust motes hovered like stalled comets" filters world through Orrin's scholarly lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—terse clauses during tribunal intrusion ("He rose, weary yet steady")—avoids lyric indulgence. Patterned elision taught early ("Spoken narrative failed here") pays off in fractured sequences' closure resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "algorithm of germination, encoded in harmonics" (causality, theme, object trait). Final line "willing to answer" avoids cliché while recharging "witnesses" motif. One minor artifact: "weathered innocence" slightly abstract but redeemed by embodied action ("expression small enough to fit between two heartbeats").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: language as botany + sonic crystal transforms "last dictionary" trope. Risk-taking (fractured sequences as narrative method) heightens stakes without gimmickry—Orrin's recording directly enables closure's visual payoff. Emotional truth in "growth desired witnesses more than owners" avoids generic wisdom through concrete folios and crystal.</comment>
