<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied metaphors ("shard of hush embedded like a splinter") without diagnostic labels. Mara's "inadvertently profound" trait manifests in the pivotal "sanctify" line that triggers the climax, showing contradictory impulses between clinical observation and spiritual urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: the charred wishbone and aligned paint chips materialize emotional stakes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as sensory density shifts from "listening" to "quickening" house, foreclosing Mara's diagnostic uncertainty through tangible reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cottage itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—the rutted floorboards reveal history, displaced swan triggers the climax. Final image of paint chips aligning as "delicate scales" charges closure by transforming setting debris into evidence of healing, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: failed displacement (swan movement) deepens stakes before "sanctify" reweights options. Cost is visceral in the charred wishbone—a concrete artifact of past loneliness that alters Mara's understanding, making the house's "mute" state legible through physical evidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "displacement was the illness, placement the cure" crystallizes via the swan's tilt and wishbone. Final image of aligned paint chips offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, reweighting the central question through environmental transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("threshold-taste in the light") filters all description through Mara's synesthetic gift. Rhythmic control shifts from stillness ("gulls were still") to quickening ("warmth seeped like late sun"), with elision ("streetlight color slid off the panes") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "brass knob felt warm despite the dawn chill" layers setting, emotion, and foreshadowing in one stroke. Minor overwriting risk in "hushed blaze" is redeemed by payoff in final line, avoiding Q7 artifact penalties while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted house" trope through object displacement as diagnostic method. Emotional specificity in "loneliness can carve deeper than knives" avoids genericity, while the orris root's role as historical compass creates fresh inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
