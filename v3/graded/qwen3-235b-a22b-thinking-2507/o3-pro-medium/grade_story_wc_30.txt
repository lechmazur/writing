<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("yesterday she was a murmuring brook... tomorrow perhaps a storm") and embodied emotion under pressure are exemplary, but single-POV limits relationship dynamics; micro-choices like hanging the creel earn closure without secondary character friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("bereft" bodies waking), and Accumulative lens holds perfectly; density increase during smelting song reweights stakes, though escalation lacks one more intensification beat before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (luminous anvil of moonlight/surf) and charges the final image; gear teeth directly "tuck" wonder, satisfying the 9+ gate through causal pressure on identity transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase (song sparks → masks → reinhabitation) is agency-driven and reweights the dominant stake, but moon-phase constraint lacks visible tradeoffs; cost is legible yet slightly abstract in "bereft" awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("wonder... humming in wintersun serenity") offers non-literal answer to preserving wonder through contradictions; avoids moralizing, though "Wonder, she believed..." risks abstraction but is redeemed by concrete smelting mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("gears... dripping seawater that hissed like cats dreaming"), rhythm modulates under pressure with purposeful compression; zero POV slippage and distinct diction elevate beyond lyrical tropes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density, but paraphrase loop in "searching for a shape of hope she still remembered. She found it..." triggers -0.2; no closure-impacting artifacts, yet prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian trope through "smelting contradictions" mechanism feels inevitable; risks bold lyric structure but avoids gimmickry, though moon-phase integration lacks transformative depth for 9+.</comment>
