<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis' contradictory impulses (cherishing fragility while adoring destabilization) drive the uncorking decision with visible cost in catalog collapse; near-deduction avoided as "perfect systems bred sterility" remains embodied in glass groaning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "Now is always" reweights reality with undeniable conceptual cost (catalog collapse, prisms singing); frost patterns establish Accumulative lens early, with rupture's cost legible in "iron on the air" and recursive footnotes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices (frost guides press arrangement, clouds as domesticated thunder); final image of "mirrored fruit" reflecting "all time breathing" charges closure through setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ellis' agency: frost's "imminent rupture" forces uncorking decision with felt cost (catalog collapse); "iron on the air" makes conceptual price unmistakable under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "Now is always" crystallizes without moralizing; final image of librarians waving obsolete checklists reweights temporal negotiation as earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("frost mapped probability currents as music"); rhythmic control under pressure flawless except slight overwriting in "tendrils of sound coiled like pale vines yearning for sun".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-synonym loop ("drifting chapters"/"drifting toward Ellis") and one density issue in high-pressure beat prevent 9+; otherwise pristine propulsion with zero scaffold in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-cosmos through glass physics; "bottled whisper with unpronounceable vowel" transforms trope with specific lived detail that alters reality's mechanics.</comment>
