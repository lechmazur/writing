<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (kneeling to tug ivy, tracing graffiti) rather than therapy-speak. Flaws (self-betrayal, chronicler's avoidance) compound credibly under pressure. Mara's introduction slightly convenient but guilt motive aligns with river's memory theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: redirected water "shimmered over tracks like apology" reconfigures forgiveness as active redirection. Hybrid lens (causal exploration enabling accumulative payoff) holds through dawn labor. Orientation solid by para 1 ("disused station... notebook damp").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Railway station actively constrains choices: ivy-strangled signal box directs hatch discovery, missing tiles force focus on graffiti. Micro-setting (accordion bellows patched with "late dusk" tape) charges final image when it "breathed river air." Environment shapes tactics (kneeling to clear runoff path).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through physical action: carving channels with crowbars makes abstract cost tangible. Protagonist agency drives escalation (comparing maps to rivulets → redirecting water), visible price paid in dawn labor. Final image reweights options with "shimmered apology" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete hydrology: "forgiveness is redirection" proven by water cleansing rails, not stated. Final image ("notebook felt lighter") reweights opening "bruised memory" without moralizing. Mara's "river remembered" avoids thematic echo by staying character-particular.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct hydrological perceptual signature ("salinity shifts," "seasonal eddies") filters all observation. Rhythm modulates perfectly: longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases under pressure ("Tiles missing like baby teeth"). Mara's dialogue stays raw ("river remembered") vs. narrator's chronicler voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with clear propulsion ("river roared within me demanding equal ink" ties interior/exterior). Figurative language precise without muddle: "water shimmered over tracks like apology" crystallizes theme. Final line avoids cliché with "pulsed with same raw solace."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness trope through specific railway/river hydrology. Fresh inflection: forgiveness as hydrological engineering ("redirect microcurrents"). Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscurity; "raw solace" redefines redemption arc through concrete labor.</comment>
