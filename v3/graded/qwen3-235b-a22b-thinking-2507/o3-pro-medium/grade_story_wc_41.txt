<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile detail ("chalk tasted like salt") but protagonist's passivity limits contradictory impulses; micro-choice to "open my ears wider" earns closure with visible cost in erased melody.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with undeniable conceptual cost: "clinging to echoes that felt like tomorrow's rust beneath today's fingertips" reweights forgetting as both burden and necessity under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog garden functions as micro-setting constraining choice (navigation by echoes) and charges closure; "marble whale blowhole exhaled fog" exemplifies environment shaping tactics when sound fails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when erased recording reveals true cost: "marrow" over tape. Agency peaks in protagonist's choice to "follow him," narrowing options with felt cost in the rust metaphor, though prophet's actions drive escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (chalk, rust, erased melody), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights memory's cost without stating a moral, satisfying non-literal answer test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasted like salt," blood's chord) with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "preknowingly forgetful" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density throughout. Slight overwriting in "preknowingly forgetful" (-0.1) but closure image ("tomorrow's rust") achieves crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through specific tactile logic (chalk→rust); risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though prophet archetype borders on familiar.</comment>
