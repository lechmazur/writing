<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "decaying directive" vs. embodied action; dancing resolves tension through specific cost (shattering seal) without therapy-speak. Flaw: micro-choices lack hierarchy during storm escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"seal warms like heartbeat" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (transient transcendence). Lens (Accumulative) held since "past gives way" with density increase via storm pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker constrains choice (slippery roots, bramble exit) and charges final image (elk parade under rain). "Spores like moonlight dust" exemplifies purposeful sensory economy that narrows under crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (decaying directive vs. motion) tightens via seal's riddle forcing dance; cost (shattering seal) is visible. Agency strong but storm pressure slightly coincidental in narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>"Purpose is a living vine" earns resonance through concrete action (dancing), avoiding moralizing. Final elk image answers "why paths choose walkers" with continuity—not abstraction—but thematic echo lingers at edge of sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("air tastes of copper") and rhythmic control peak in "boots splashing... vines swaying" during dance. Zero head-hopping; compression ("past gives way") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dust made of moonlight and ground glass" shows textural density without muddle. Final line’s reprise ("dance will begin again") recharges opening with propulsion—no figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time perception (foresight/hindsight) with "living vine" purpose avoids tropes; engineer’s laugh transformed by "mischievous wind chime" specificity. Risk-taking (dance as resolution) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
