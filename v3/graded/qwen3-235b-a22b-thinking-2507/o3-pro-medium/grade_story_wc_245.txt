<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through tactile language absorption; micro-choice of pressing palm to chest reveals hierarchy of values with visceral cost ("maps half drawn, fears unaddressed"). No therapy-speak, only concrete sensory contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: compass dissolving into liquid light reconfigures stillpoint from external place to internal coordinate. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase in "braille constellations" charges final image with undeniable emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest actively constrains choices: spruce teaches "glacier patience," fern supplies "sigh vowels," directly enabling climax. Final hollow lined with root seats charges closure, fulfilling 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally as "knotted chord" forces Oriole inward; cost is tangible (ring dissolution) and reweights final image. Agency shines when she redirects language flow inward—escalation driven by her choice, not coincidence, under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "maps inked in sorrow but bordered by tenderness" avoids moralizing. Final image ("an invitation home") resonates as non-literal answer to "how to guide footsteps," with conceptual cost in dissolving the ring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—"tasting vibrations," "spilled lantern light"—with rhythmic control that intensifies under pressure. Compression taught early ("leaves vibrated beyond hearing") pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("ring warmed like dawn cupped in metal" conveys time, emotion, object state). Final line recharges "way home" with crystalline propulsion—no figurative muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms mapmaking trope through blindness and emotional cartography; "stillpoint as internal coordinate" feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
