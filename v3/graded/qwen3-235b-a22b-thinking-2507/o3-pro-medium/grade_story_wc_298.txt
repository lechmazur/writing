<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied emotion ("tremor behind dusky resolve") and micro-choices like reckless seed selection. Final renunciation of her future feels earned by prior vulnerability, though Mira’s off-page presence slightly blurs the relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: Liora’s vision of "wandering empty wards" crystallizes the cost while the ballast seed reconfigures her stance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shifts in the orchard’s hush and apple quivers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—roots demand femur placement, apples absorb hopes—and charges the final image ("orchard settled back into shadowed silence"). Sensory specificity ("pale apples whispering") avoids symbolism clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Liora’s agency: her spoken dreams narrow options when Keeper demands "more than memory." The cost ("void behind ribs") is unmistakable in the traded-futures vision, tightening stakes under the Accumulative lens through atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the burned Sun card cooling to ash reweights sacrifice without moralizing. Final line ("dusky resolve bloomed anew") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief’s hollowness, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("dusky resolve," "lantern beams") with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision of Mira’s fire is taught early and paid off in the traded-futures vision, avoiding helpful-narrator syndrome.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density; "inlaying meaning everywhere" repetition is a minor scaffold loop in non-closure beats. No figurative muddle—metaphors like "seeds spilled as tiny obsidian mirrors" sharpen rather than obscure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms destiny-barter trope through specific, grounded mechanics (tarot seeds, orchard rules). Emotional truth in Liora’s "reckless idealist" choice avoids generic templates, though catacomb orchard risks minor genre echo without sufficient freshness.</comment>
