<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Mira places the dome and spots the bookmark, shifting from contemplation to active purpose with embodied cost ("surprised at how light responsibility could feel"). No stock phrasing; her "stubborn purpose" directly fuels the dome's creation under isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "feeling warmth she herself had placed there" crystallizes the cost of thawed isolation, reconfiguring "safe zones" as internal. Orientation anchors (location/character) hit by line 1; Accumulative lens holds as melting ice tightens temperature-pressure stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The permafrost actively constrains choices ("temperature gradients performed treacherous tricks"), charging the final image where sunlight christens the dome. Sensory hierarchy masterfully filters through Mira’s glassblower lens—powdered snow mixed with cobalt sand, gloved-palm tremor measurements—making setting a tactical character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through environmental pressure: melting ice both enables work ("ice outside finally melting") and threatens it ("treacherous tricks"). Agency shines as Mira repurposes abandonment into creation, but the single tightening lacks a visible forfeiture; cost is felt (emotional thaw) rather than dramatized as a lost opportunity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the dome’s reflection ("no longer purely contemplative but actively alight") reweights "thawing heart" as internal safety without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—epiphany arises from concrete action (pressing palms to glass), though "philosophical echoes" slightly risks abstraction early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glassblower’s tactile focus ("gloved palm" measuring tremors) and lyrical urgency ("Molten glass bloomed like sunrise captured in a sphere") modulate perfectly under stress. No head-hopping; free indirect style seamlessly blends narration with Mira’s ritualistic self-talk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rivulets hissed across permafrost" exemplifies textural propulsion where every phrase advances atmosphere or character. Slight register drift in "philosophical echoes" (line 8) but redeemed by concrete action. Final line’s "quiet, sweeping thaw" charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms glassblowing from craft to emotional metaphor through specific stakes (domes as "safest zone for inquiry begins within"). Avoids derivative tropes via polar setting and "thawing heart" lens, though the symposium backstory slightly echoes common artist-rejection arcs without fresh inflection.</comment>
