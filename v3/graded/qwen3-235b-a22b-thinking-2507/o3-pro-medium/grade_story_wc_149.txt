<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' honored/terrified duality, but "mournful elation flooded him" veers toward abstract labeling without sufficient embodied contradiction during peak crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"she began to ghost again" crystallizes the debt's conceptual cost—but escalation lacks one tightening beat; bead insertion to apple splitting feels slightly compressed under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice (crucibles, stem fissure) and charges the final steam image, though "black condensation" edges toward ornamental overwriting without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) tightens meaningfully when Seraphine places the bead, but cost legibility suffers slightly—Seraphine's dissolution feels earned yet the emotional price lacks one visceral detail anchoring the "mournful elation" in physical sensation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of seeds weaving constellations offers resonant answer to "debts across lifetimes" without moralizing; "the fields listened" reweights the hush with conceptual cost, fulfilling CR requirements flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("plum crucibles," "resonant awakenings"), but "mournful elation" momentarily drifts into abstract lexicon during climax, slightly undermining Elias' concrete alchemist POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density shines in "bark glowed with pulse-like lanterns," yet minor scaffold appears in parallel constructions ("rows... hummed," "glass panes dripped") diluting propulsion during setup beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and grief avoids trope pitfalls; "resonant awakenings" feels inevitable through concrete stakes, though "ashen-veil" risks proximity to gothic clichés without sufficient transformation.</comment>
