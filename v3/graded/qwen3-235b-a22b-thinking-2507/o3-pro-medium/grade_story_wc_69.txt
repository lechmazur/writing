<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Mara’s motivation is clear but flaw depth under pressure remains abstract. Debaters function as collective, not individuals with distinct micro-choices during harmonizing. "Throat tight" embodiment in Doyle shows promise but insufficient for earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("unlearning hatred" made tangible in councilors’ moist eyes). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silence deepens stakes. Council arrival risks coincidence but chord’s agency tightens pressure. Cost proof solid in "bewildered relief of children suddenly forgiven."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Velvet library actively constrains choice: burgundy drapes muffle echoes enabling rehearsal, alcove’s "queer acoustics" create necessary silence. Final image ("city humming in unfamiliar peace") charges the setting’s transformation. Dust motes as "lanterns" avoid cliché by serving the harmony motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mara’s agency: "subtracting noise" deepens pressure by forcing debaters to suppress retorts. Cost is felt in "arguments dissolved not in defeat but in resonance." Dominant stake (vanishing arts) tightens via council confrontation, but secondary pressure (sirens/slogans) lacks on-page testing beyond Doyle’s nod.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rosette siphoned bitterness and returned sweeter overtones," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("chord went on... braiding diverse voices into tomorrow") reweights "vanishing arts" as persistent action. No explicit thesis, but "unfamiliar peace" slightly overstates resolution for accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dried leaves, candle wax, and sheet music" filtered through Mara’s artistic lens. Rhythmic control shines in "pause grew round and resonant, like the hollow of a long-absent instrument." Minor register drift in "denote" but consistent voice under pressure. No dialogue to test subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dust motes that shone like lanterns" integrates image with action. "Throat tight" borders cliché but earns specificity through Doyle’s role. Final line’s "traveled stillness" risks abstraction but anchors to opening. Minor overwriting in "glimmering like a frozen sun" dilutes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "vanishing arts" trope through "harmonizing by subtracting noise" as tangible method. Emotional truth in councilors’ "bewildered relief" avoids sentimentality. Lacks one fresh inflection beyond sensory specificity; "zither rosette as heartbeat" echoes common symbolism without sufficient reinvention.</comment>
