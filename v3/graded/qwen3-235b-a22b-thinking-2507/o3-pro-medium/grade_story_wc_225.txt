<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through bead arrangement (crimson gamble vs silver defense) and guilt that "recoiled but did not flee." Final self-forgiveness earned via tactile work, avoiding therapy-speak. Prince's ghost appears abruptly but compression justified at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: self-forgiveness crystallizes options when "air shuddered" and "woven hush unraveled" with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens held via thunder-lull rhythm tightening pressure. Anchor clear by word 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and tapestry constrain choices—they're micro-settings where reordering hedges and arranging beads directly alter tactics. Final image ("labyrinth glowed softly") charges closure by reweighting prior guilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: bead rearrangement forces trade-off (brilliance vs mercy), labyrinth reordering embodies humility. Cost legible when "woven hush unraveled" spilling motion—visible price paid for self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "pruning unwise moves from memory," "rethreading through his own heart." Final rook image answers central question without moralizing—conceptual repricing where chess moves now carry redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chess metaphors filter all observation ("streets as chess files"). Under stress, syntax compresses ("He knelt... unrolled... began") without voice slippage. No head-hopping despite reflective depth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trembling, he rearranged the beads" replaces interiority with action. Final line ("lifting a rook high") crystallizes motif without muddle. Figurative language serves pressure in every high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Frozen-time trope transformed through chess logic: "woven hush" as tangible restraint, beads mapping gambits. Prince's ghost isn't redemption—it's the final bead snapping into place, feeling inevitable through prior causality.</comment>
