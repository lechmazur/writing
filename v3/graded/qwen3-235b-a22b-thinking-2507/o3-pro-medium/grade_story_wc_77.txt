<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear (tricking fear's weakness) with embodied contradictions (skeptic turned accomplice), but Eli's drowning backstory feels tacked on rather than integrated into peak choices. Final renunciation of clasp earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("clasp-shaped void glimmered like a promise") under Accumulative lens. Minor escalation gap: advisor's climax role relies on coincidence rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: opera clasp constrains choices (metronome heartbeat, breastplate) and charges final image. Avoids carnival clichés through tactile decay ("peeling skeletons," "wet straw and ozone").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Eli's agency (unbosoming, dictionary use), but fear's vulnerability to "vanity" feels slightly convenient under Accumulative pressure. Cost legible via breastplate's bursting and void.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image reweights theme without moralizing: "clasp-shaped void glimmered like a promise" crystallizes fear's cyclical nature. Avoids thematic echo while deepening "repulsive allure" through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lingering luminance," "syrupy darkness") modulates under stress, but "photographically cursed" diction risks register drift in high-pressure beats despite voice justification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion, but stacked modifiers in climax ("breastplate burst, flooding hallway with white fire") slightly obscure cause/effect. Zero loops in closure beat saves from deeper penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Organic synthesis transforms carnival horror through specific mechanics (dream dictionary paradoxes, luminance physics). "Repulsive allure" reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight while heightening stakes.</comment>
