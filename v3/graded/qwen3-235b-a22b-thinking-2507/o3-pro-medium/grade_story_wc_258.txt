<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Jonas’s embodied emotion shines when he gasps at the tape’s revelations, but Mirelle’s internal contradiction (pragmatist vs. mystic) lacks visible struggle during the pivotal card reading, slightly thinning her agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: rain shifts from "prison bars" to "threads awaiting weaving" with undeniable cost in Jonas’s cracked steadiness and the coinless wallet’s sacrifice, all under a tight Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (zero aligned at heart) and charging the final image; volcanic glass cards and rain-beaded skylight filter perception through Mirelle’s tactile worldview.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Jonas’s agency—speaking observations rewires the tape—yet the singular tightening lacks a visible trade-off; cost is emotional (his cracked steadiness) but not tactical, missing 8.8+ band guardrail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "culture is drawn, not stored" crystallizes through the tape’s transformation, avoiding moralizing; the final line’s "belonging" reweights collapse as communal rebirth without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice mastery in "mysteries clotted thicker than ever" and rain-as-needles imagery; perceptual signature is distinct (Mirelle notices tactile details), though "steadiness cracking" slightly tells rather than shows under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "midnight glyphs shimmered and new numbers inked themselves" achieves high density without muddle. Minor abstraction in "inherited mystery seeped" is redeemed by immediate concrete action ("resonance left by former tenants").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cartomancy tropes via data archaeology; the measuring tape’s evolution from tool to timeline feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes without gimmickry, hitting Q8 9+ quick test.</comment>
