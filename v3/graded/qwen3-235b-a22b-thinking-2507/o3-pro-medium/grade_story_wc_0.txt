<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete scientific observation ("water beaded through powder, making rivulets") rather than therapy-speak, but Jonah's shift from procedural urgency to awe lacks sufficient micro-choice friction to feel fully earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Jonah signs the form, crystallizing the cost of abandoning protocol; the Accumulative lens holds through dust-pattern escalation, though the flood's aftermath exerts slightly passive pressure on the single meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dust constrains every key choice (tracing the trail, clearing the trench) and charges the final image of unfurling seedlings; "brackish water reflecting sunlight in pulsing morse" exemplifies sensory specificity that mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen coherently as Mara's dust demonstration transforms Jonah's "raze the greenhouse" urgency into active collaboration, but the moral calculus lacks competing goods—Jonah's insurance forms never genuinely threaten the seedlings' survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through capillary action and stellar diffusion parallels; the final river image reweights "gradual change" as gentle persistence without moralizing, avoiding the Thematic Echo penalty that plagues weaker literary fiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "silence folded over the property like a breathable tarp" and rhythmic control during the dust-trail demonstration; no head-hopping as Mara's scientific lexicon ("fractal signature of diffusion") remains consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or synonym loops; "gray powder, the strange dust from butterfly wing scales rent loose by turbulence" achieves high density without muddle, though "kindled humility" slightly drifts toward abstraction in an otherwise concrete scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brilliant synthesis of astrophysics and botany transforms the "gradual change" trope; the dust motif’s specificity (butterfly scales → stellar grains) feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking heightening stakes through scientific verisimilitude.</comment>
