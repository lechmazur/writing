<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Serah pivots from lock-focused duty to revolution; embodied choices (rotating gnomon, drumming knuckles) reveal hierarchy of values under blackout pressure without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: locks clicking open reconfigures freedom’s cost via dispersing footfalls, not cheers, with causal lens holding through blackout-to-surge sequence; cost legible in "revolution honoring its vow of silence."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (bronze quill holder) constrains every choice: its weight guides Serah’s steps, quartz shards enable the lattice, and emptiness charges the final image where doors "salute" with "grateful metal."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blackout tightens options meaningfully—initially a barrier, then catalyst for timing—driving Serah’s agency to repurpose the sundial; cost crystallizes in silent dispersal replacing expected triumph, narrowing stakes to pure consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "polite giants" doors yawning open: revolution’s cost isn’t violence but the weight of silent freedom, reweighted by Serah’s vanished smile folding back into "winking hush" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in tactile lexicon ("warm as if remembering flame," "ozone slithered"); stress compresses syntax during quartz placement, while Aldren’s "salute only executed during astronomy drills" reveals voice-specific subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lattice lightning, crawling through forgotten conduits" exemplifies high-density propulsion where metaphor clarifies physics, not obscures it, with rhythm varying from staccato steps to flowing surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Silent revolution" trope transformed via electrical lock mechanics and quartz shards’ specificity; the blackout’s dual role as obstacle/catalyst feels inevitable, avoiding abstraction through Fort Lumen’s "stained-glass corridors" and ration candles.</comment>
