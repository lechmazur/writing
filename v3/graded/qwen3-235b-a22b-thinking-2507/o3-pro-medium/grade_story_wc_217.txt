<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (feather hum, silt swirls); contradictory impulses (seeking beauty while confronting discord) earn the final renunciation of perfectionism with visible cost in the mended kite's flight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the repaired kite's ascent crystallizes the reconfigured stake (beauty in incompleteness) with undeniable conceptual cost—the acceptance of impermanence made legible through "patches glowing like stained glass" against the "brightening heavens."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drake's feather and lagoon silt function as micro-setting; the feather constrains the kite-mending choice while the silt's "gray ghosts" charge the final image of woven dawns, embodying the theme through tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Edda's agency: her barefoot entry into the lagoon actively harmonizes discord (ripples, gulls, fishermen), tightening the dominant stake (finding beauty in brokenness) until the kite's repair forces the trade-off between perfection and resilience with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mended kite's "stained glass" patches—a non-literal answer to "why keep trying?" that reweights prior fragility ("woven dawns") without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in the lagoon's "fresh glass" shimmer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress: Edda's "warmly attentive" focus narrows to silt swirls and feather thrum under pressure, with rhythmic control in "crookedly, looped, and plummeted" avoiding syntactic monotony while teaching the accumulative lens early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gray ghosts that vanished" exemplifies high-density propulsion where metaphor clarifies rather than obscures; "rivering upward" in the final beat shows rhythmic precision that charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "beauty in brokenness" trope through specific, grounded choices: the drake's feather as literal kite brace and the boy's storm-chasing rationale create emotional truth beyond abstraction, with risk-taking in the quiet Charged Poise closure.</comment>
