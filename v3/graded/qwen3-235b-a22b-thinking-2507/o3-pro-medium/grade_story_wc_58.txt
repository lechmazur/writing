<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Selene's "projecting presence" duality and Holt's hunger to map healing; embodied emotions avoid cliché ("trembling fingers," "paired ghosts rehearsing departure"). Final renunciation (her vanishing) earns cost through the thread's lingering warmth, though minor under-dramatization of her corridor avoidance slightly softens stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "obituary is a compass" crystallizes options with conceptual cost legible in "thread warm against my wrist" and "unsung pulse under feet." Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to midnight's frost-filmed bench, tightening pressure without causal breaks; cost proof evident in the final breath imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Garden setting actively constrains choices (ivy lattice filtering moonlight for clandestine meeting, frost forcing departure), but the carpet thread—micro-setting object—charges closure by becoming Holt's tactile link to Selene's pulse. Sensory hierarchy reflects Holt's obituary-writer POV, avoiding white-room syndrome with "skeletal oak scribbling constellations."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("disappearance was the realm's currency") tightens through Selene's revelations into midnight's crystallized vanishing. Holt's agency in writing ("tentative longitude") and her correction ("sorrow must border hope") drive escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in frost filming the bench and paired ghost-breaths, unmistakable at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "geography of healing" reweighted by the final image ("unsung pulse under feet") as non-literal answer to "how to heal through naming." Zero thematic echo—Selene's "compass not tombstone" avoids moralizing, while carpet thread's evolution from heraldry to pulse embodies earned wisdom without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Holt notices "copper" light and "dry leaves like distant applause," with rhythmic shifts matching emotional pressure (lyrical during revelations, clipped at climax). Psychic distance modulates perfectly for intimacy during thread exchange; dialogue indirection ("weave it into kingdom's memory") carries subtext without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence multiplies meaning ("wind scuttled dry leaves... sounding like distant applause for a play no audience would witness"). Figurative language precise without muddle ("branches scribbled constellations"); final line avoids closure dilution with "unsung pulse under feet" recharging prior motifs through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "obituary writer" trope through specific logic: memorials for the living address "departure not death," with healing as map-making. Carpet thread isn't symbolic ornament but causal object (must be "pulled through every line"); emotional specificity in "projecting presence" avoids templates while risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
