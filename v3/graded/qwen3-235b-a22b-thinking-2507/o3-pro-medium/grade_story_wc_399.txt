<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation ("to preserve the echo") is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction lacks embodied friction; "understood wisdom was not to be spoken" feels told rather than revealed through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the compressed ripple’s weight "like a harmless stone" crystallizes conceptual cost with undeniable pressure, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through resonant reconfiguration of silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet’s living sandstone constrains Lira’s ritual choices and charges the final image—reflected light compressing history—proving environment shapes tactics and closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lira’s agency: her consecration act narrows options (silence vs. leakage), but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in her physicality during the peak ritual beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "wisdom preserved, not spoken," yet the final line risks thematic echo; resonance is earned by Lira’s embodied action but lacks competing moral complexity in the desert’s silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measuring invisible threads," "reading a library" in sand) sustains rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping despite dual journeys, with lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "applause smothered in velvet" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "rumor insisted" (telling in high-pressure beat), but figurative language never muddles causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms desert mystic tropes through specific mechanics: "conjured clearings" as tangible silence and ripple-compression ritual feel inevitable in hindsight, heightening stakes without abstraction.</comment>
