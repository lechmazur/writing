<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's "logically emotional" trait manifests concretely when frequencies "read her intentions as if bone were parchment," avoiding diagnostic labels. Callix's sonic quest drives action, but lacks contradictory impulses in climax—micro-choice of threading copper wire shows professional precision under pressure without deeper internal tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: auroras as "signatures upon newly silent parchment" reweights sound's moral role with undeniable cost (Callix's collapse, raiders' shame). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through sonic density (forks, harmonics, subharmonics)—with no causality breaks despite raider arrival feeling slightly coincidental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively constrains tactics: frozen planks enable Mara's squeaking boots as auditory cue, floes amplify harmonics, and copper wire integrates lighthouse beacon. Final auroras charge closure by transforming "silent parchment" into resonant metaphor—environment essential to the defense mechanics and thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightening is protagonist-driven: vibrational system activation narrows options when raiders strike, with visible cost (Callix's exhaustion, "pulsing grief" repelling invaders). Escalation under Accumulative lens—density shift from tuning forks to subharmonics—makes greed's amplification inevitable, avoiding coincidence in resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through raiders' "pulsing grief" and final auroras—not stated. Avoids Thematic Echo; "sonic absolution" is earned via embodied cost (Callix's collapse), with auroras offering non-literal answer to "can sound confess?" without moralizing, embracing complexity through resonant particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Mara notices "brass gears," Callix "unseen wavelengths." Rhythmic control shines during high-pressure beats ("subharmonics erupted... heavy enough to tilt lantern flames"), compressing time without sacrificing clarity. Voice modulates from "fleeting golden sunset" lyricism to stark "terrible mirror of sound" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vapor-thin rime" exemplifies textural specificity without overwriting. Every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes ("icebergs chimed in sympathetic reply"). Peak-beat clarity during barricade activation—no figurative muddle despite density—proves propulsion under pressure with rhythmic variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" transforms artifact-guarding tropes through specific physics-morality synthesis: sound amplifies greed's "ugliness back," avoiding abstraction. Risk-taking (sound as moral litmus) heightens stakes coherently, with "molecular sympathy denied" feeling inevitable in hindsight through established vibrational rules.</comment>
