<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Alyss's "luminescent ache" versus her bold action; embodied emotion avoids labels ("grafting herself onto community like living stalks"). Lio's thinner interiority slightly limits relationship depth but doesn't undermine the earned closure where peripheral isolation transforms into "threaded" belonging with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the new obsidian shoots shaped like reeds/pencils crystallize kinship's cost with undeniable pressure ("Alyss no longer felt peripheral"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—density of sensory details ("ringing like teaspoons") deepens the stake without causal breaks. Orientation anchors by line 3 prevent penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard actively constrains choices: reeds graft onto obsidian lattice with "tiny holes," and frost dislodged by vibrations becomes prismatic mist holding ancestral faces. Final image of interlocked shoots charges closure by making environment the literal vessel of kinship.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via Alyss's "luminescent ache" for community; escalation through accumulative deepening as weaving reeds narrows options to irreversible belonging. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation from "peripheral" to "threaded," earned by her prior vulnerability at the arbor's base.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: grafting reeds onto stone mirrors grafting into community, culminating in the non-literal answer "orchard became map, shelter, and chorus." Avoids moralizing—the final "color too ancient to have a name" resonates without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV perceptual signature is reed-sculptor specific ("bottled rain," "frozen sap"); rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn descriptions to staccato action ("A sudden gleam arrested them"). Lio's dialogue carries distinct historian cadence ("Offer your thread...") without convergence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("flakes of mirrored dust fell... ringing like teaspoons"). Figurative language precise and pressure-appropriate—only "breathing aurora" slightly muddles but doesn't obscure closure. Final line’s "color too ancient" charges the image without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "community" trope through specific grafting metaphor and obsidian arbor as living kinship conduit. Emotional truth in "patience, promise" longing avoids abstraction; risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with the shoots' irreplaceable shape. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
