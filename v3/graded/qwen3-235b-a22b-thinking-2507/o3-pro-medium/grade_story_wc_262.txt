<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "spatially imaginative" trait informs method yet isn't pressured. Interiority poetic but leans toward abstract insight ("unused love was not stored but paused") over embodied struggle during pivotal projection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("storage unnecessary; it preferred circulation"), but cost legibility falters—thunder's recession feels symbolic rather than earned consequence. Accumulative lens holds, though projector's tune emergence lacks causal groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Projection booth micro-setting constrains choices (threading film, hum calibration) and charges final image ("booth door, hearing the city hum"). Film strip as recurring object evolves from relic to catalyst, dissolving into "motes of freed affection" that reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as letters dissolve and tune surfaces, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—resolution hinges on projector's accidental melody rather than Mira's contested choices. Cost ("storage unnecessary") remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dissolving letters and circulating love reweight "unused" as active choice. Final image ("lyrics that had finally found their tune") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while answering the central question through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paragraphs sighed a name she almost remembered") sustains rhythmic control, though "hushed thunder" metaphors occasionally verge on overwritten lyricism. Focalization remains tightly bound to Mira's sensory experience without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but minor overwriting in atmospheric beats ("breath held underwater"). No closure artifacts; final line ("walked on, certain she carried no unused love anymore") achieves crystalline propulsion through concrete image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes psychometry and cinema tropes through specific "unused love" framing. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes, though vintage theater setting borders on familiar. Emotional truth anchors universals in verifiable details like "cotton gloves" and "dusty bulb".</comment>
