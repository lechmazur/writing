<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marla's contradictory impulses ("nervously confident," "tidal urgency" vs. dread) drive her irreversible exchange; final choice earned through prior decoding struggle and librarian-specific authority when rejecting Havel's demand for data.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: Marla's permanent exile crystallizes when the hallway "folded shut like a book," made undeniable by Havel holding the warm nail and tasting identical dread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Experimental weather station constrains choice—buoy's metal enables nail activation—and charges closure: the warm copper nail in Havel's palm embodies the transferred exile cost, transforming a tool into thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marla's agency: shouting the phrase with "question mark, question mark" forces the sea's recoil, narrowing options to irreversible exchange; cost legible in her vanishing footprints and Havel's inherited dread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "two mapmakers redrawing wind" offers non-literal answer to "ocean forgetting its name," reweighting exile as active remembrance without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in Havel's unresolved dread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "barometer sounded like a hinge" and "tasted spongey dread" filter crisis through librarian's precision; rhythmic control intensifies during gale with clipped phrases mirroring stanza beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "waves heaved with mournful rhythm" merges action/image without overwriting; final line's "spongey dread" resonates thematically while avoiding repetition through shifted POV ownership.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of weather science and library tropes feels inevitable: "borrow tomorrow" phrasing transforms exile myth through occupational specificity, avoiding derivative safety with irreversible exchange mechanics.</comment>
