<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in hesitation versus powdering shards; embodied emotion via "breathing trembles" and "dust from palms." Lacks visible micro-choice showing hierarchy of values (e.g., why continue when tempted to stop?), preventing 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mask "breathing" crystallizes the "mirage of safety" with cost ("stitch old griefs anew"). Anchors who/where/when by line 3. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (porcelain shards, rocking chair) constrains choices—shards must be used without waste, chair's movement mirrors emotional state. Final image of mask "breathing" directly charges closure under 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("crystallize emotion before dawn") tightens through hesitation and physical trembling. Cost legible in "stitch old griefs anew," but lacks visible trade-off (e.g., time vs. perfection) to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mirage of safety" motif reweighted at closure: mask makes viewers "believe cracks belong elsewhere." Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing; avoids sentimentality via concrete ash/porcelain imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dust ghosts," "moon as slivered pupil." Rhythm varies under pressure (short clauses during tension: "He lifts a mortar."). Patterned elision taught early ("memories sift upward") and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("ash, always, is his signature medium" does triple duty). No figurative muddle—porcelain "lungs flexing" serves closure. Final line’s "infinitesimal sway" resolves opening’s dust ghosts with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "grief art" trope via ash/porcelain fusion. "Mirage of safety" concept reimagined as self-recognition trap. Risk-taking: making mask creation feel cosmically significant through specific mechanics (shards → powder → breath).</comment>
