<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Milo’s contradictory impulses (dread vs. hope) act simultaneously in the vanishing scene; his closure choice—turning the hourglass—stems from childhood motivation ("merge timelines") shown through knotted-cleat instinct, not abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the ferry’s return "stitched" yet passengers carry "unstamped" memories, with tangible cost in Rowan’s tearful resolution into a "younger self"; Accumulative lens holds via patterned rethreading (constellations → hourglass sand) reweighting "impermanence as arrival."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hourglass constrains Milo’s final choice (turning it) and charges the closure image as a "quiet tide clock"; luminous moss "like slow tears" mirrors emotional weight without overt symbolism, while "proto-sand" physically manifests the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: star constellations shuffling → voices becoming "motes" → hourglass sand "not yet sand" deepens the dominant stake (stranded home); cost crystallizes when Rowan’s "younger self" emerges, altering tactics through earned emotional vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "woven string" motif recharged in closure: "honoring the fragile miracle of merged days" avoids moralizing; the final image (Milo studying ripples) resonates with the opening "polishing brass cleats," answering the central question through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Milo’s "calligraphy written via interconnected patterns" noticing; rhythmic control under pressure ("deck tilting not downward but sideways through itself") avoids head-hopping, with compression ("clocks run sideways") taught early and paid off in grotto’s "rearranged constellations."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "proto-sand began to fall, each grain sparking as it crossed" delivers high density without muddle; strategic telling ("For weeks the vanishing commuter ferry...") compresses backstory, while final line’s "compass resetting" recharges opening tides with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing-ferry trope through "spectral grotto" as micro-setting that pressures choices (Milo stepping onto bow); the "woven string" synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric time-shifting) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
