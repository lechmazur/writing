<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (duty vs obsession with time's meaning) drives closure choice; embodied grief/gratitude at revelation avoids tidy resolution. "Numbers never calmed his question" crystallizes authentic conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("gratitude and grief") under Accumulative lens. Pressure deepens via counting ritual's failure to sand's transformation, reweighting stakes through texture not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fjord and pipes function as micro-setting that constrains choices (squinting, tracing fractures) and charges final image ("water would answer"). "Wind scraped the cliff with razor edges" embodies urgency through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding time's essence) tightens through deepening: hesitant pipes → crack → billet → mirror revelation. Cost is conceptual (grief/gratitude) and visible when "he understood: the pipes were veins."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (water as blood, pipes as veins), not abstraction. Final image reweights time as "unbroken conversation" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in Trond's earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Trond notices hydraulic details ("brass elbow," "water columns") while wind "scraped the cliff." Rhythm modulates perfectly from lyrical mist to tense conduit exploration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "razor edges sharper than the fishmonger's knives" exemplifies textural precision. Final line recharges opening motif with crystalline propulsion: "the water would answer, and he would listen."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time trope through hydraulic metaphor with emotional specificity. "Clocks measured circulation of connection" feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety middle via bold conceptual risk grounded in fjord realism.</comment>
