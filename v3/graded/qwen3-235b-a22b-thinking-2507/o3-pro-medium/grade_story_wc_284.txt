<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene: Mara’s "prudently daring" steps versus "old tension stitch[ing] into her shoulders." Final choice to carry repaired trust earns closure with visible cost in mirrored burns and melted snow codes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "go west, together" crystallizes stance with felt cost in cauterized choices and snow codes melting by noon. Accumulative lens holds through snow-glyph progression and gear repair tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Snowfield as micro-setting constrains choice (glyphs must be precise) and charges final image: "snow-written codes would melt... but what they carried would not dissolve." Mist evolves from "muffling" to "brightened toward something almost melodic," mirroring trust reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: gear repair narrows options to "go west" with visible cost in "cauterized choices" (scars) and Elias’s "engineer’s gaze" acknowledging "errors lived beyond recall." Dominant stake (trust repair) tightens via screwdriver mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brass gear repair: "Fixing what’s broken... not pretending it never shattered" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image of pillbox "ticking against her pulse" offers resonant answer to "unused courage" question via tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "Mist blew... like breath drawn and held," "shadow pooled between the grains." Rhythmic control under pressure via compressed syntax ("Nothing ticked yet, but possibility vibrated...") sustains Accumulative lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "pillbox... weighed exactly as much as everything broken." Final line’s "thaw met earth and future sounded like clock newly wound" delivers closure without figurative muddle. No overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy tropes: "codes in accumulated snow" replaces tradecraft with tactile vulnerability. Emotional specificity in "cauterized choices" avoids sentimentality; gear repair transforms betrayal into earned hope without safety-hedging.</comment>
