<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize in the chest-opening moment: duty to guard fears versus self-preservation. Embodied coral patterns pulse with static; no diagnostic labels despite high stakes. Slight underdevelopment of "strangely organic" trait limits micro-choice depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "fears inside were smaller now but never gone." Causal lens holds through ethanol ring assembly → ignition sequence. Evacuation siren turn-off feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Desert rose farm constrains every choice: ethanol from waste, dome integrity, rose dormancy. Coral-patterned hands charge the final image. "Powdered amber sunlight" sensory specificity avoids cliché while reflecting android's nostalgic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally when holograms attract geomagnetic surge, forcing miniaturization. Magnetic shift timeframe pressures ignition timing. Astronomers' announcement slightly expositional but necessary for clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" theme emerges through chest compression and final line—no moralizing. Rose dormancy (not ash) reweights preservation concept. Avoids false balance; children's fears remain valid despite miniaturization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Android's perceptual signature shines: "coral patterns creep within casing," "sorrowful carillon." Syntax compresses under storm pressure ("Then I struck a spark"). Zero head-hopping; organic resin secretion deepens voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serpent respecting my measured geometry" shows multi-jobbing prose. Slight register drift in "soothing augury" but redeemed by character voice. Final line's rhythmic cadence ("newly quiet heart") elevates closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian android" trope through donated childhood fears. "Controlled burn" as chaos containment feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric prose for robot POV) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
