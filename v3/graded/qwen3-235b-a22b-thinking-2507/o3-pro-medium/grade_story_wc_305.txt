<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear (hollow after forgiveness) and actions driven by internal conflict, but the pivotal forgiveness backstory remains summarized rather than dramatized with embodied contradiction during the climb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise RR: dissolving the hairpin creates irreversible cost ("scallop indentation") while reconfiguring contentment as a river; textural escalation through sensory accumulation holds the Accumulative/Textural lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hairpin functions as micro-setting—constraining choice (beckoning deeper) and charging the final image (dissolution); vineyard hush evolves from static backdrop to humming joy, mirroring Simeon’s internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (hollow identity vs. contentment) tighten through Simeon’s embodied release of memories into clouds, but the forgiveness backstory’s abstract presentation slightly blurs the cost’s visceral immediacy despite the tangible hairpin dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the riverbank metaphor and dissolved hairpin, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("light enough to fit in a breath") reweights prior struggle without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," "muted resonance vines know") and rhythmic control shine, but the reflective block on forgiveness lacks sufficient micro-choice anchoring in present action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("pressed," "tapped," "dissolved"); minor register drift in "tender as first grape skin split for wine" slightly over-embellishes the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of vineyard stewardship with grief ritual avoids trope; risk-taking in textural escalation pays off, but the "cycle of rebirth" concept leans generic without deeper transformation through Simeon’s specific flaws.</comment>
