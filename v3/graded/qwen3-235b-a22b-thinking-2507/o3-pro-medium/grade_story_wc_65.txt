<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Estra's "groundedly imaginative" trait manifests in concrete micro-choices (30-word constraint, predictive modeling) with contradictory impulses (empiricism vs. dreaming). Bryn's secondary pressure crystallizes her stance, but his underdevelopment slightly weakens relationship dynamics. Final choice earns cost through visible new ignorance sprouting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: writing succeeds with undeniable cost ("every bloom casts a shadow"). Causal lens holds perfectly—predictive model reveals coup chain, 30-word constraint narrows options, and immediate caravan siren proves causality. Orientation anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake function as micro-setting: blizzard delays courier, ice enables hoofbeats, dawn mirror charges final image. Kingfisher quill constrains choice (30 words) and reappears "hungry for possibility." Sensory hierarchy reflects Estra's urgency—gears and snowmelt scent dominate crisis moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent coup via innovation) escalates through Estra's agency: predictive model tightens options to 30 words, writing alters reality. Cost is unmistakable—new ignorance sprouts as direct consequence. Coincidence (blizzard) complicates but doesn't resolve; constraint shapes every tactical choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: Bryn's skepticism vs. Estra's "roses against stone" metaphor, 30-word limit proving constraints breed innovation. Final image ("pen hovered, promise taut") reweights the premise without moralizing—sustaining transformation acknowledges shadows while embracing ongoing work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV voice is character-particular: Estra's perceptual signature filters data ("copper constellations on cheeks," "metallic snowmelt scent"). Under pressure, syntax tightens ("She dipped... yet held it poised"). Bryn's dialogue carries subtext ("why constraints?"), contrasting her empirical rhythm with his skepticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances plot or character. Peak-beat prose ("ink spread like thawing dusk") avoids figurative muddle while charging consequence. Final line recharges kingfisher motif with "blue and fierce" specificity. Rhythm varies perfectly—staccato during writing, flowing at dawn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" transforms tropes through specific stakes (coup prevention via modular mills). Emotional truth in Estra's drive: innovation as necessity, not vanity. Final synthesis—pen hovering amid new blizzards—feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding abstraction with ice-water mills and brass engines.</comment>
