<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: analytic patience vs fraying emotion embodied in wire-tracing and snow globe rituals. Jonah's absence tightening "across my ribs" avoids label-speak while showing cost of the final release choice. Reyes remains functional but underused as off-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "lighter by the weight of knowing how to unclench" crystallizes the letting-go calculus with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds from first line ("hush of regulators") through journal revelation to resignation transmission, reweighting stakes via density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sunken library actively constrains choices: currents displace books into "star fields" forcing the transmission metaphor, while copper wire's physicality drives the thematic breakthrough. Snow globe release charges the final image as micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("physics of letting go") tightens through protagonist's agency: wire analysis → journal epiphany → model creation. Cost is unmistakable in "resignation measured in wavelengths"—a conceptual price that forecloses the quest while altering tactics toward release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through wire knots and snow globe physics without moralizing. Final line "sea kept turning pages" reweights "letting go" as natural process, avoiding thematic echo while resonating with the mathematician's "surrender could solve for peace" as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in marine physics lexicon ("pressure squeezes [fame] into silence") and compression under stress ("voice to gravel"). Death's capitalized presence maintains consistent focalization while rhythm modulates from analytic to elegiac in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding: "sprinkling letters from open books into star fields" compresses setting/theme in one image. Metaphors cohere ("arrested time" → "vanishing curve") with no register drift. Final line variation avoids cadence monotony while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via deep-sea physics metaphor: "knots were not accident but articulation" feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (Death as capitalized presence) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in "buoyancy debate custody."</comment>
