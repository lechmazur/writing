<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora’s reluctant transformation versus her steady purpose; embodied cost in "feathers bristling like sunrise" avoids abstraction. Slight over-reliance on "paradoxically steady" label risks abstraction but redeemed by visceral metamorphosis details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "metamorphosis paused... balanced" crystallizes the cost with cosmic intimacy. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; orchard’s heartbeat mirroring reweights stakes with undeniable conceptual cost from the spice ritual’s consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard constrains every choice—dusk-foxes as guardians, pear tree as ritual anchor—and charges the final image with "moon-feathered hair." Micro-setting (censer, urn) directly shapes tactics; "cardamom, saffron, ghost-pepper" specificity pressures the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: splitting magic "like bread" forecloses full human return for both, with visible cost in halted transformation. Spice ritual’s escalation reweights reunion as coexistence, not restoration, under Accumulative lens with felt price in "galaxies blossoming inside our chests."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "stone will ache to become heart" literalized in urn/ash, resolving into scattering smoke for "grieving travelers." Final image reweights grief as shared lifeline without moralizing, though "after phoenix rises" borders thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"hearing every dreaming paw," spice aromas "sharp as comet tails"—with rhythmic control under stress. Transformation scene’s fragmented syntax ("My voice cracked to chirrups") mirrors physical unraveling; no head-hopping, voice modulates from steady to avian.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "vapor curling like spiral constellations" and "palms that glowed pearly." Minor deduction for "paradoxically steady" repetition bordering on scaffold, but redeemed by motif integration. Closure beat ("half-light, half-lifeline") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms phoenix trope through specific mechanics (ember-lit ash, ghost-pepper spices) and emotional truth in grief’s "reluctant, still-beating transformation." Risk-taking—magic as split sustenance—heightens stakes coherently; "conjuring bonds reborn after ash" feels inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
