<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in 'abandoned tenure... never my notebooks' but 'chaos converging' repetition slightly flattens emotional layering under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with 'cultivating every unspoken word we hadn't yet been charged for,' though auditor resolution leans slightly convenient for Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse actively constrains choices (vents reversing, capillary pipes) and charges final image; 'bioluminescent spores mapping longitude' perfectly embodies micro-setting rule.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's airflow reversal under Accumulative lens, but warping infrastructure feels slightly external to agency-driven escalation at critical moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through 'living syntax' gardening and 'recklessness in vines,' avoiding moralizing; final image reweights 'converging chaos' into hope without stating meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ('glossed insect stridulations,' 'mantis gunmen') sustains rhythmic control through crisis; no head-hopping despite dual presence in greenhouse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats but 'neural meters like epaulettes' registers slight register drift; otherwise impeccable propulsion with 'ultraviolet patterns shifted to question marks' crystallizing tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through entomological specificity ('ant dialects,' 'emergency exit trills'); 'thoughts taxable' premise gains freshness via gourd rattle seeds as linguistic weaponry.</comment>
