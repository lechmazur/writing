<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in pivotal choice: "If I paddled away... another rumor unverified. Instead I tied the box..." Embodied cost of truth-seeking manifests physically as ink bleeding yet holding under station master's gaze.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: lock gate's "slow groan" crystallizes the past's unmasking while protagonist's transformation into "unpredictable force" forecloses anonymity. Causal lens holds through ledger discovery → documentation → confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Canal actively constrains choices: water warmth enables salvage dive, limestone walls demand poling. Sundial's physical interaction (gnomon aligning to lock gate) charges final image where "water mirrored sky so perfectly direction seemed conspiracy."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: choosing documentation over escape ("Instead I tied the box...") directly triggers station master confrontation. Cost manifests as visible transformation into legend, though company threat remains slightly off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "numbers shimmering where names should have been" crystallizes "architecture of lies." Final image reweights canal as "open conspiracy" without stating moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "mist lay in bands... cool and luminous as breath made visible" filters observation through seeker's lens. Under pressure, syntax compresses ("Instinct whispered, Salvage it") while station master dialogue carries precise subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "serene upheaval of minute ripples" avoids figurative muddle through concrete verbs. Final line achieves crystalline density: "lock gate closed with slow groan, as if past itself accepted unmasking."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms historical trauma trope via specific mechanisms: sundial as "moral weathervane," "clockwork sun" folklore. Fresh inflection in truth as active corrosion: "silence corrodes more than confession" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
