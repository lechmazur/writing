<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in vault scene ("steal truth for himself or share it"), but Mara's late introduction lacks micro-choices to test relationship dynamics under pressure; pulse-recording choice earns closure through embodied honesty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("light said enough" reconfigures truth-sharing); Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation (petrichor ticket to quartz chalices) tightening transparency stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Quartz chalices function as micro-setting that literally guides Silas ("whispering names when touched"), and the restless lens constrains his vault choice then charges the final image with "prismatic honesty" on Mara's face.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Silas' decoding agency narrows options to the vault's moral test; cost is unmistakable in shelves swinging "like silent jury boxes" and releasing artifacts—a felt conceptual price for truth-sharing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through projected heartbeats reweighting "ambiguously clear" into practice; final image ("light said enough") offers non-literal resolution to "freed by honesty" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("mist spread like low music"), but "synesthetic composer" registers clinically amid poetic voice; rhythmic control under pressure ("dripping gutters that rang like distant bells") sustains Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "moonlit rain still steamed off cobblestones" achieves high density. One near-slip: "prismatic honesty" borders on therapy-speak but redeemed by concrete action (Mara lowering her guard).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "truth-telling" trope through light-as-language risk; lens as covenant (not trophy) synthesizes mistrust thaw with specificity. Derivative guardrail passed via pulse-recording innovation.</comment>
