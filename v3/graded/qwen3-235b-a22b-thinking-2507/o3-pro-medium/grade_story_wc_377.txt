<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices: Arlen's mute season forces kinetic communication during council confrontation, and his "warmth where cold should dwell" discovery drives the hinge repair. Embodied emotion in "each tap measured by heartbeats" avoids labels while showing tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Arlen's etching of "silent instructions" crystallizes the stakes with "winter would return, his voice would lock" making conceptual price legible. Accumulative lens holds throughout as density tightens from council tension to the crack's discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its "turquoise fire" reprise when ravens circle proves essential. Clouds actively constrain choices ("clouds parted" enabling light refraction), and the bluff's physicality pressures every action from rope-bridge climbs to etching.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: the warming iceberg deepens the dominant stake (preserving wonder) until the hinge crack forces Arlen's repair. Visible cost in "metal might weary again" charges the etching climax, though the single tightening slightly limits pressure complexity for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "symphonies of truth" shifts from metaphor (council's silent understanding) to tangible "carved choreography" etched in stone. Final image of "color, truth, and wonder kept their careful concord" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—"vowels stolen by wind," "clouds curled like parchment"—with rhythm modulating from lyrical dawn to urgent repair ("each tap measured by heartbeats"). Compression taught early ("silver hush") pays off in the etching closure without loss of clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-perfect density: "Bronze chimes... formed a helix rising like a question without a mark" advances character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Minor deduction for "sagging as if gravity remembered it"—slightly mixed metaphor in a high-pressure beat that dulls closure clarity by 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms mute-artist trope through kinetic specificity: "feathered gears" and "vector paths" make wonder tangible. Emotional truth in Arlen's quiet resolve ("silence felt less like loss") avoids sentimentality, while the iceberg's warmth-to-crack progression feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
