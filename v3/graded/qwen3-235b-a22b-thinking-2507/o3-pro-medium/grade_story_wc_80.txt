<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: surveyor's precision vs. archiving "unworthy" dreams drives every micro-choice. Embodied emotion ("brine erupts like trapped applause") avoids labels. Minor deduction for near-tidy emotional resolution in burden exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "footsteps echo with dreams newly un-abandoned" crystallizes stance with felt cost (burden transfer). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through note-placing and box discovery without causality breaks. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (water depth, time pressure) and charges closure. Tide isn't backdrop but active constraint—tiles guide movement, flooding forces retreat. Inkwell's texture ("kisses the wood") elevates final image beyond description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (memory vs. erasure) tighten through Accumulative escalation: note-placing deepens to lockbox discovery, each beat narrowing options. Agency-driven (he chooses to open box), cost legible when "pavilion wrested a burden." Minor deduction for tide's role slightly overshadowing protagonist's active choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" evolves from metaphor to physical reality, culminating in non-literal closure ("dreams newly un-abandoned"). Theme emerges through concrete acts (dowels in pilings), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights loss as active preservation without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: surveyor's professional eye ("brass theodolite") merges with poetic lens ("mist flares like a hushed blaze"). Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato under pressure ("He tries picking it, but the hinge refuses"), lyrical in reflection. Zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("wrests," "taps," "soaking"). Figurative language serves theme without muddle ("ink stains his pocket like irony"). Minor deduction for "stoically sensitive" repetition, though purposeful as character anchor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms preservation trope through specific acts (dowels in pilings, inkwell rituals). Emotional truth anchors universals—surveyor's "archeology of abandoned dreams" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though burden exchange borders on clean resolution.</comment>
