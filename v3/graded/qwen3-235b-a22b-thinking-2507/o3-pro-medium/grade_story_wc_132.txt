<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: scholarly precision clashes with visceral transformation when sap replaces blood; micro-choice to "loosen clenched jaw" earns final surrender. No therapy-speak, only embodied stakes in bark filigree on palms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when she chooses the "understory where opposites braid," with undeniable cost in bark-covered hands. Accumulative lens holds—each sensory detail (roots unlatching, photosynthesizing lungs) deepens the metamorphosis without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis constrains choice: mold patches become active pressure when she heals it with woody fibers, and its "newborn green" gleam charges the final image. Rain isn’t backdrop but tactical pressure—drumming drops sync with her metronome-fast panic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from identity crisis (bark on palms) to irreversible transformation (equinox frontier), driven by her agency—"reconstruct by releasing control" shifts from mantra to survival tactic. Cost is visceral: "bark filigree traced her palms" forecloses humanity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: clover sprouting from footprints, moonlight coaxing wrist-blossoms—not abstract "belonging." Final seed in palm reweights the linden leaf’s meaning without moralizing, embracing complexity in "opposites braid."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is botanist-sharp: "veins shimmered silver" not "glowed," "scholar within scanning sensations." Rhythm compresses under stress ("Panic threatened, but...") while maintaining lyrical precision through transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line multiplies pressure ("wind flicked her ponytail like a metronome" establishes tempo for panic). Minor drift in "circuitously sincere" abstraction, but final image’s "punctuation of a new chapter" charges closure with crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "plant whisperer" trope through scientific framing—photosynthesis in lungs, germination songs. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes: "slow collective conversation of green things" feels inevitable, not quirky. Freshness in orchards learning "overnight."</comment>
