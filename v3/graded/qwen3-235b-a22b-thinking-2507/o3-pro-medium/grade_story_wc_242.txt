<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in cultivated estrangement vs connection shines during the boy call, but motivation for "teaching endings" remains slightly abstract despite embodied choices like striking the disc. Epiphany feels earned yet lacks prior visible friction with the philosophy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: booth light dimming "as though exhaling a chapter" crystallizes cost of the boy's resolution. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned escalation of wrong numbers to self-confrontation, though the "decades" time leap risks causality coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax—striking it creates the resolution note—and charges the final image ("harmonica note still rings inside my jacket"). Tactile specificity like "hot dust and fresh paint" evolves causally with the city's encroachment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation to self-ringing phone forces crystallization of the operator's stance, with cost legible in altered streetlamp hum. But the "decades" time jump obscures causal pressure, making the boy confrontation feel slightly abstract rather than viscerally felt under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "wrong numbers are my currency" and the florist's flower names avoid moralizing. Final image ("endings everywhere are clearing their throats") offers resonant non-literal answer to the estrangement/beginning question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("cracked vowels," "buzz outside a cracked blind") and rhythmic control under pressure ("twined by accident") are exceptional. Non-standard grammar like "loop the call" serves voice without confusion, taught early and paid off in the self-loop climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story (e.g., "feed a quarter... coaxing the line to wake" compresses action and character). Minor register drift on "decades" risks lexicon plausibility but doesn't dull the closure's "harmonica note" resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "lonely operator" trope through specific, grounded choices: glass harmonica disc as estrangement tool, florist call loop. Emotional truth in "cultivated estrangement" avoids cliché; risk-taking (time loop) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
