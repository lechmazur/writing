<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory claustrophobia/open-deck panic embodied in "counted heartbeats to keep corridors wider" and resolved by "crowding comfort of shared purpose." Final choice to return earns closure through prior causality (glint map timing) with visible cost ("tracking their next forgetting").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "invisible footprints dry into salt" reconfigures memory's fragility with conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by word 20; tidal clock ("moon pivoted west") tightens options without causal breaks. Slight lens ambiguity at gate ignition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" of cables/waves functions as active micro-setting, constraining Lira's panic ("chest fluttered") and charging the final lullaby. Brine literally powers the console; tidal clock forces exit. Environment shapes every tactic and the salt-footprint payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (beat the tide to resurrect unremembered) escalates via moon pivot and "tide slobbered against hatch lip." Cost unmistakable in "tracking their next forgetting"—preservation guarantees cyclical loss. Agency clear in override safeties; coincidence (cables humming) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "invisible footprints dry into salt"—a resonant non-literal answer to memory's ephemerality. Avoids moralizing; vapor souls "more real than living workers" shows complexity. Final line crystallizes cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: cables "hummed like trapped eels," data as "blue icon." Rhythmic compression under stress ("She inhaled until ribs hurt") stays consistent. "Moon pivoted west" shows time via character lens; zero filter verbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "damp auroras" for brine condenses image/atmosphere. Final line achieves crystalline propulsion. Minor deduction for "desert heat above asphalt" simile—slight anachronism risk in drowned facility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis: phase transitions of silence made visceral via vapor-resurrected archivists. Transforms "haunted facility" trope through specific stakes (tidal clock, gold fleck mechanics). Emotional truth in "standing by unremembered" as literal cloud-resurrection.</comment>
