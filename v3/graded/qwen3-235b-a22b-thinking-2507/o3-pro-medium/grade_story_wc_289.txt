<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (trafficking in "hush" vs selling romance) drives the climactic release of the letter; embodied cost ("breathed outside her ribs") makes renunciation visceral. Slight abstraction in "lightness" edges toward label-speak but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara's stance crystallizes ("not to imprison secrets") with undeniable conceptual cost when the boat drifts. Accumulative lens holds—each object (nest, filament) deepens pressure without causal breaks. "Follow the water" intuition risks convenience but framed as sensory revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lotus pond actively constrains choices (envelope stepping stones, boat release) and charges the final image. Thrush nest and filament aren't decorative—their mechanics directly alter tactics (blurring ink, vibration transmission). "Prismatic quiet" evolves into communal hum, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keeping vs releasing secrets) tightens when Arun confirms the coil "remembered nothing," foreclosing Mara's fear of betrayal. Cost is visceral and legible ("breathed outside her ribs"). Pressure grows through sensory accumulation under Accumulative lens—no agency gaps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: blurred ink becomes river map, boat joins pond. Final image ("signing with the world itself") reweights "keeper of secrets" without moralizing. Avoids false balance—Mara's shift feels inevitable through concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("weatherproof satchel of unfinished love letters," "prismatic quiet") modulates under pressure—lyrical compression during transformation ("felt, rather than heard"). Arun's dialogue carries subtext about memory; rhythm varies from fluid to crisp ("folded it into a paper boat").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "watery echoes" and "thrush's nest twig spiral" avoid figurative muddle. Final line ("signing it with the world itself") charges closure without abstraction. Minor tell in "reluctantly, a keeper" offset by overwhelming specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghostwriting + audio-tape filament transforms clichés of secrecy. Specific details (salvaged tapes, envelope stones) avoid abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscurity—the "thread" concept feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
