<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clarion's "strategically creative" trait drives key actions (knothole gambit, piano placement), but interiority leans abstract ("steely longing pooled") without sufficient embodied contradiction beyond the initial clock pocketing. Final match-flame moment shows earned growth through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: pressure builds through sensory density (compasses, film grain) to Charged Poise closure where "fate lingering in the vestibule" crystallizes rebellion with visible cost in the warming-but-unfading longing. Orientation anchored immediately in opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Broken clock functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (hidden in piano dampers) and charges the final image via "fractured numerals" tinting notes. Tidal arbor's creaking branches actively guide breathing tactics, not postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (defying time's tyranny) tightens meaningfully when Clarion threads the film reel, with cost legible in "trains delayed themselves, brakes sighing." His agency drives escalation from descent to piano placement, all under "horizon invites night" pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of "fate lingering... waiting for an encore it had not plotted" reweights time as malleable through art without stating theme. No moralizing; conceptual cost made undeniable through compasses skewing toward "storm-born harmony" and match-flame payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rusted rails hummed," "chordal gusts") with rhythmic control during piano performance ("Commuters grumbled, then quieted..."). Slight register drift in "steely longing" but no head-hopping; compression taught early via film-reel transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured numerals scattered onto hammers" achieves high density without muddle. Minor figurative risk in "moon-colored leaves caught updrafts" but paid off by ship-at-anchor simile. Closure image ("match resembled faithful compass") crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms time-rebellion tropes through specific mechanics (harmonica-steered compasses, film-reel portals). "Anniversary clock" irreplaceable—its broken state enables ghostly iridescence. +0.4 risk distinction for match-flame compass payoff growing from prior particulars.</comment>
