<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied micro-choices: Maeve halting gratitude "as deftly as she had halted the mainspring" reveals her practical skepticism. Arden’s "tears pooled on the velvet, baptized by music" avoids therapy-speak while layering spiritual/emotional conflict. Only minor deduction for Arden’s reaction slightly generic in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the mended heartbeat "counting chances" while Arden weighs Maeve’s counsel crystallizes stakes. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (cedar, rain, arrested starlight) until the tuning note’s "dawn-colored moth" reconfigures possibility. Prison machinists underutilized but not fatal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: tweezers "fine as dragonfly legs" and millet-sized gears dictate repair precision. Final image transforms brass shavings into "shy stars," charging the opening’s "unsung lullabies" with earned hope. Environment’s tactile evolution (storm to moonlight) mirrors emotional shifts without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Maeve’s agency: her warning that "the tune becomes decoration" without action forces Arden’s pivotal question ("What action would match the music?"). Cost is visceral in pooled tears and "cog ungreased" uncertainty. Escalation driven entirely by protagonist choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brass etchings vs ink, not moralizing. Final image—moonlight on shavings as "shy stars"—reweights "unsung lullabies" with quiet resonance. Avoids false equivalence: victims’ agency ("let them decide if pardon belongs") frames redemption as earned, not granted. No thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures: Maeve notices tool precision ("light breaks through storm clouds"), Arden through spiritual lens ("prayer candles seeking glass ceilings"). Rhythm modulates perfectly—short repair beats ("Gears rolled... stopped") to lyrical closure. Minor deduction for "baptized by music" slightly elevated for POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; every line multiplies meaning: "rain streaked his overcoat, but hope still misted... like incense escaping an unlatched thurible" compresses setting/emotion. Final line’s "gears, rain, and repentance kept measured time" achieves conceptual repricing without slack. "Cog ungreased" saves abstract "voice trembling" with embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms apology trope through clockwork specificity: "ruby cam cracked" and balance wheel etchings make redemption tangible. Risk-taking in quiet closure—no easy resolution, just "newborn promise" cradled. Fresh angle: apology as object needing repair, not words. Avoids sentimentality via action ("fabricate identical wheels").</comment>
