<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "thrifty even with his awe" and astrolabe sacrifice; embodied emotion via calloused fingertip warming tile. Lacks deeper fear/courage interplay during pivotal ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: tile's extra row proves "mystery expands without losing equilibrium" with visible cost (sacrificed astrolabe). Accumulative lens holds through ritual intensification to crystallized covenant understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reimagined palace functions as micro-setting: cracked fountain's night-water reflection charges closure, while mosaic floors and drooping banners constrain Naram-ben's ritual space. Tool (astrolabe) sacrifices directly alter final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Naram-ben's schematic choices: aligning Polaris narrows options to sacrifice, with tangible cost (astrolabe loss). Pressure accumulates via tile's pulse-to-sigil transformation under Accumulative lens, though fear/thrill conflict needs sharper interweaving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "devotion to discovery" realization reweighted by tile's mathematical constancy; avoids moralizing via "balanced within perpetual twilight" final image. Slightly over-articulated in "offering thrift, fear, and wonder as equal coin" near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "serpentine numbers," "dusky harmony," and "thrift" lexicon reflect astronomer's mind. Rhythmic control peaks in "painted lions roared soundlessly" compression; no head-hopping despite painted observers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "motes of dust like tiny comets" shows textural density. Minor register drift in "empirically ironic rite" (academic diction mid-ritual) prevents 9.0. Final line's "subtle gravity" delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Babylonian astronomy and mathematical mysticism avoids cliché via "parabolas doorway" and copper-coin miser framing. Bold risk: covenant revelation as conceptual equilibrium shift, not deity encounter, heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
