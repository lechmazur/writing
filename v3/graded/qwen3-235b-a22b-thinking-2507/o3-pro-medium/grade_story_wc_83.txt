<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Ashraf’s bride-symbol dilemma, but "bleak exhilaration" veers toward diagnostic label-speak during peak crisis, slightly undercutting embodied authenticity despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Ashraf’s uncertainty about delaying war versus saving lives crystallizes stakes through causal agency, with orientation anchored by paragraph one’s "wedding canopy dissolved into ash" disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The geode crystal constrains choices throughout and charges the final image ("intangibly tangible enough to carry him forward"), though "acid clouds" and "copper spines" occasionally lapse into generic tech-poetry without POV-filtered specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Ashraf’s agency narrows options to one live choice—surrendering the geode—with visible cost (extinguishing his bride’s symbol), but the "singular node" threat lacks sufficient causal tightening beyond the final crater confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geode’s charged reprise: the final image of "quieter answers" resonates as a non-literal answer to weaponization’s cycle without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite Sanaa’s mirthless laugh about ordnance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky sang with iron") falters with register drift in "perturbation theory" passages; rhythmic control under pressure is strong but "intangibly tangible" repetition weakens voice cohesion in closure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density and propulsion marred by paraphrase loops ("intangibly tangible" x3) and slight scaffold in "bleak exhilaration" descriptions; final line’s "carry him forward" avoids figurative muddle but repetition dulls closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms war trauma through physics metaphors (perturbation theory as emotional lens), with "unfiltered awakening" offering fresh moral calculus; risks unconventional structure but avoids gimmickry via causal integration of Ashraf’s quiet resolve.</comment>
