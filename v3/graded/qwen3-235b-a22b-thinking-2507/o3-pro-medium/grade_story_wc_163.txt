<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's embodied conflict (tears floating like pearls while renouncing the feather), but Lio's presence lacks meaningful friction to deepen stakes; micro-choices under pressure earn closure through the feather's return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("rhythm continues between notes") lands with felt cost (feather sacrifice), but sunrise deadline escalates too late; one distinct non-closure issue (static pressure until alarms) triggers -0.8 penalty under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the burnt feather constrains choices (sensor activation) and charges the final image; coral pillars/anemone corridors actively shape movement, meeting 9+ gate via environment charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sunrise deadline tightens final choices but remains abstract until late; one meaningful deepening (alarm forcing data harvest) suffices for length, though cost legibility lags until feather return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tidal lullaby's concrete reweighting of "belong" without moralizing; final image ("belonging to both sky and sea") offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo in peak beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("constellations mirrored on drowned boulevards") holds under pressure, but "velvet precision" and "glitchy spasms" show minor overwriting in climax; rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "whispering softly ingenious currents" (redundant adverbs) and three "luminous respite" repetitions; no closure-dulling artifacts, but paraphrase loops prevent 9+ band despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of landscape astrology with drowned city avoids trope pitfalls; "carbon signature" activation feels specific and inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric density) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
