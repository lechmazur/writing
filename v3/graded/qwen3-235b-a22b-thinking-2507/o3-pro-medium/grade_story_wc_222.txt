<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kestrel's contradictory impulses (caution/abandon) drive micro-choices under pressure; her final descent "empty of loot yet full of amazement" earns visible cost through renunciation of theft. Interiority avoids clichés via concrete embodiment ("gloved hands bleeding through frost").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the spire's sigh and "mountains still existed below" legibly reconfigure certainty into possibility under causal lens. Orientation anchors by line 1; no causality breaks in the ritual swap sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Icebound spire actively pressures choices (bleeding climb, storm risk), while the sundial lid as micro-setting constrains the climax. Final sky recharging "deliciously unknown" directly charges closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kestrel's agency: her dialogue ("I carry an invitation") transforms confrontation into collaboration, tightening options under causal lens. Thunder's unrest provides unmistakable conceptual cost for shifting destinies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through action—swapped secrets restoring "play where stagnant prophecy had frozen hope"—with no stated moral. Final image ("future had remembered how to play") offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars drifted like bruises") and rhythmic control under pressure; compression during tension ("Letting caution ice my pulse") maintains voice coherence. No head-hopping; focalization perfectly calibrated to Kestrel's wonder-apprenticeship.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances multiple elements ("steam coiled into miniature galaxies" proves apprenticeship while escalating tension). Final line recharges opening with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "thief" trope into sacred amendment of prophecy via chess secrets. Risk-taking heightens stakes (uncertainty as antidote to poisonous certainty) without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generality.</comment>
