<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" duality; aging during mirror repairs manifests tangible cost. Motivation rooted in grandmother's legacy avoids abstraction, with embodied emotion ("time soften around wrists like wet clay") replacing labels. Micro-choices like pressing the sphere reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "silver threading her hair" during repairs crystallizes entropy's price. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation (vortex tightening, cracking mirrors). Orientation anchors immediately; no causality breaks despite lyric structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Time-neutral hoarfrost and oak acorn cap function as micro-settings constraining choices—the cap's evolution directly enables mirror healing. Final image of "thaw she had grown" charges closure through setting transformation, avoiding static postcard description. Sensory details filter through seed-saver's bias (e.g., "texture of borrowed time").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes materialize viscerally as "panes cracking, leaking seasons," with Alma's agency driving deepening via acorn cap's transformation. Escalation tightens through her escalating repairs under accumulating cost ("Every repair left her older"). Cost is unmistakable in silvering hair, altering her final stance without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (healing mirrors with sphere) not abstraction. Final line "tasted the rough, sweet texture of borrowed time" delivers non-literal answer to central question, reweighting entropy with visceral cost. Avoids moralizing by showing aging tradeoff rather than stating wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in agricultural lexicon ("heirloom seed saver," "replant") and time-focused noticing ("minutes became malleable"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato during vortex tightening ("shaping breath into numbers"), lyrical in closure. Zero POV leakage in single-character focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line advances texture ("amber veins, humming like a hive of muted suns"). Final image "world reopened, gentler, by decreasing entropy one seed at a time" crystallizes closure without muddle. Figurative language serves theme consistently, with propulsion matching emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Transforms entropy concept through seed-saving lens ("decreasing entropy one seed at a time"), avoiding trope recycling. Emotional truth in Alma's quiet sacrifice (aging for restored moments) elevates beyond surface novelty. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
