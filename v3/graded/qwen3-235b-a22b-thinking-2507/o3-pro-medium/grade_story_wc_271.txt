<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Anisa's curated wreckage vs. "anchor optimism in realism" goal manifests in micro-choices (tucking photo post-tour). Embodied trauma ("chest tightened when thunder cracked") avoids diagnostic labels. Malik's quiet support shows relationship as crucible without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "pearl nested inside cracked lens focusing sunlight" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (her reversed freeze response). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density tightens through somatic exercises to crystallize stance. "Fragile yet deliberate" stillness proves cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Arboretum constrains choices: glass wall trembling with wind enables the palm-on-glass exercise; sequoia repotting becomes emotional conduit. Final "cobalt thread" image charges closure by stitching environment to theme. Salt-crisp air and cliffside thyme actively shape somatic markers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Anisa's agency: designing somatic stations deepens the "anchor optimism" stake under pressure (thunder triggering freeze). Cost is unmistakable—"chest tightened" then reversed by Malik's pulse. Narrowed options crystallize in her leading the tour despite fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light metaphor: "pearl of stillness" evolves from photo artifact to active philosophy ("light refract through ruins without pretending ruins gone"). Final cobalt thread image answers central question without moralizing, grounded in "salt on tongues" and "survival sings in small data."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gulls wheeling like loose gears," "soles whispering" reflect Anisa's trauma-honed attention. Rhythmic control under pressure—short staccato during panic ("I almost froze"), flowing prose in calm moments. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored in sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "salt wind skated along glass corridor" establishes textural density immediately. Figurative language sparse but potent ("gulls became silhouettes of questions"). Final line's "cobalt thread" avoids purple prose through concrete specificity, propelling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: somatic trauma work in arboretum setting transforms "hope" trope. "Pearl of stillness" reframes resilience as portable physics (absurd yet earned). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—tour design feels inevitable through horticultural lens.</comment>
