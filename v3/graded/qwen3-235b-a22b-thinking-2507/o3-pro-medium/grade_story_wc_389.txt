<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Orrin’s "resolve not to choose a flag" versus stitching "future loyalties," and Elara’s "wish to keep singing" amid prophetic pressure. Embodied cost: "grease blackened their fingers" during switch-rhythm practice forecloses easy solutions. No therapy-speak; flaws drive struggle organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "dawn carried the grit of storms and whimsy of lullabies" reweights the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors by word 15 ("Orrin stood alone on stormlit observatory"). Lens clarity: density peaks when song "sprayed across horizon," narrowing options via lyrical pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cobalt glass constrains every key choice—from writing messages to Elara’s final song—and charges the closure image ("observatory felt more sky than stone"). Sensory hierarchy perfect: Orrin notices "turbines in chest" from her voice, not abstract hope. No tourist catalog; tools (brass dials, lever chords) are tactile and plot-critical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Orrin’s agency: reversing antenna polarity to summon Elara tightens the dominant stake (dissolving "variant allegiance"). Cost crystallizes when "rust blackened their fingers" practicing switch rhythms—a tangible loss altering tactics. Single deepening suffices: song’s broadcast forces stance crystallization amid "skirmishes and revelations."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cobalt-tinted beam" and "turquoise rain" translating song into social change, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("dawn carried grit of storms") offers non-literal answer to "ancient shadows" premise. No thematic echo; complexity lives in "variant allegiance dissolving like wet paint" without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Orrin’s "lightning scars on glass" observation reflects his visionary role. Rhythmic control peaks during storm climax ("singing a single, impossible note that split the thundercloud"). No head-hopping; dialogue subtext ("leadership could sound exactly like lullabies") carries weight through implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Days passed like rusted gears begrudgingly turning" slightly overwrites but earns payoff in "lanterns mirroring galaxies." Zero scaffold; high density in "men... found variant allegiance dissolving like wet paint." Final line’s "vision is never solitary once it is sung" avoids sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet" trope via song-as-weapon ("lullabies silenced artillery") and cobalt glass as political tool. Fresh inflection: "variant allegiance" dissolving via "colored thunder" feels inevitable from radio-static beginnings. Avoids abstraction—"bottled lightning" engines slumber "like chained giants" grounds universals in specificity.</comment>
