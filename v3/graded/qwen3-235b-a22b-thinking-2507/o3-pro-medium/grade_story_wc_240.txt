<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically: "flames contained but devouring each doubt" shows simultaneous caution/curiosity. Final choice to press the button earned by doctoral backstory and spatial trait, with cost in "all her years of guarding thresholds collapsed."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands unmistakably: spores spelling "welcome" reweights security's meaning with conceptual cost ("nothing secure can grow"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of bioluminescent imagery tightening stakes to a single crystallized realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent farm actively constrains choices: permeable barriers enable crossing, caps tilt to form corridors, spores trace vectors. Final "welcome" in green cursive charges closure by transforming setting from guarded space to collaborative thesis defense.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs surrender) escalates through protagonist agency: Mara's decision to press the laser button narrows options, with cost visible in "years of guarding thresholds collapsed." Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens as spore release visualizes the physics of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "recalibrating sensors to welcome metamorphosis" reweights security without moralizing. Final spore-formed "welcome" offers non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while charging conceptual cost of "nothing growing can stay secured."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "spatially gifted" lens filters observation ("folding space like origami"). Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from "quiet wildfire" containment to "fire without noise" as syntax compresses during barrier crossing, teaching pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density throughout. "Breath crystallized in cold humidity" shows rather than tells tension. Final line "spacious and full of motion" charges closure without figurative muddle, though "quiet wildfire" repetition risks slight dilution in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms doppelgänger trope through bioluminescent physics metaphor. Emotional specificity in "cautious watching" vs "possibility of surrender" avoids genericity. Risk-taking (permeable barriers as security revolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
