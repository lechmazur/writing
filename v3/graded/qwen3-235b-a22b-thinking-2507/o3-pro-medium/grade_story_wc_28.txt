<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("aberrant mercy") is embodied through micro-choices like placing the tessera, but Rima's "warm coldness" feels thematic rather than character-driven; retrocognition's sudden efficacy at climax lacks struggle, weakening motivation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with "Solaryn" renaming, but cost remains abstract ("warm coldness") without concrete consequence; retrocognition leap to city's dawn feels unearned, breaking accumulative lens cohesion at pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plaza functions as micro-setting: tessera placements alter wind's whistle, ash constrains movement, and stepping stone's grout directly charges the final image of "open doors" through tactile interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renaming as healing) lacks escalation; pressure grows texturally but protagonist agency is passive (waiting for tessera's "song"), with no tangible cost beyond emotional abstraction during the renaming climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "arms of steel" motif reweighted by closure, but "aberrant mercy" remains stated rather than dramatized; final image avoids moralizing yet cost feels conceptual, not visceral, limiting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("stones trembled with memories"), but "retrocognitively trapped" disrupts lyrical flow with clinical diction; Rima's dialogue lacks idiom differentiation from Aarik's interiority during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwriting dilutes closure: "sparks of blue light... neither heat nor chill" creates contradictory physics; "warm coldness" repetition in final beats forms a paraphrase loop, muddling the earned cost required for high-band scores.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mosaic artistry and city-renaming avoids post-apocalyptic clichés, yet "aberrant mercy" concept feels derivative of common trauma-recovery tropes without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
