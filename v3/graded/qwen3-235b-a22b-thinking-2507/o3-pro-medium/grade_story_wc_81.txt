<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("fingers readjust a crooked volume") but lacks contradictory impulses under flood pressure; calmness feels unearned as stakes escalate. Micro-choices under stress are minimal—stamp application lacks hesitation despite torrents.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "scarlet ink blossomed, finalizing the verdict of deceit even as torrents roared." Accumulative lens holds—algae dimming reweights truth's fragility without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ink stamp constrains verification tactics (touch-only in darkness) and charges the finale: "stamp’s red proof bled" transforms it from tool to truth’s physical manifestation. Coral-bound codex’s texture exposes forgery, not mere set dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when floodgates fail—"pressure sought new paths" narrows options to stamp-or-drown. Agency shines as Maris lifts codex *then* stamps, but blackout coincidence slightly muddies situational pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" isn’t preached; earned through ink blooming on wet paper amid chaos. Final dawn "preparing to open fragile pages" reweights truth’s cost without moralizing—resonance from concrete particulars, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly: short, urgent sentences during flood ("Water surged") contrast lyrical reflection. "Tranquilly perceptive" bias shapes noticing (salt breeze, ink grooves), though "method stood clear" slightly drifts into academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dappled resolve" evolves meaningfully. Only hairline slip: "phosphorescent plankton drifted in shafts" slightly overwrites during high-pressure escape. Propulsion flawless—"algae light dimmed, and water surged" compresses cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken library trope transformed through indexer’s tactile logic—truth verified by texture, not sight. "Alternative hypothesis of courage" synthesizes method and bravery, but moral calculus lacks fresh inflection beyond expected stakes.</comment>
