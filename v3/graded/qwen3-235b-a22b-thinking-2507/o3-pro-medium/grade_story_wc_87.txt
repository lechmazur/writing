<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "merrily melancholic" duality and paddling as "spinning smile," but compass confession ("revealed my own turbulence") edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly diluting embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "backlash of regrets grew quieter" crystallizes cost through tidal retreat image, with Accumulative/Textural lens holding via sensory density (utility poles to power lines) reweighting stakes without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Utility poles evolve from "ordinary beacons" to "confessionals" to literal power lines, constraining navigation method and charging the final image—environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Gideon’s agency: compass failure → storm confrontation → memory-triggered choice, with lightning strike complicating (not resolving) stakes; cost legible in "willing punishment" to "fragile grin thrown across failure’s surface."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "humble intentions gravitating toward love" reweights prior maritime failure without moralizing; final tidal image resonates as non-literal answer to redemption, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("barnacles drip silver tears," "utility poles marched sideways") with rhythmic control—short sentences for panic, flowing cadence for resolve—but "plastic hull scraping a chord" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sparks cascading like harsh fireworks" avoids mixed metaphor by linking to prior "bruises" imagery; every line propels momentum with textural specificity ("cocoa sloshing, forgiveness warming the cup").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope via mundane utility poles as spiritual anchors; emotional specificity in "stone must spin and smile at water" avoids generic templates while heightening stakes through risk-taking lyricism.</comment>
