<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied transformation from cartographer to walker feels earned through concrete actions (kneeling, matching steps), but her internal contradiction lacks friction—shifting from mapmaking to rebuilding occurs without visible struggle against her ingrained "urgent lines," missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Lira’s tearful renunciation of escape ("maps... pointing away from heartbreak") crystallizes when she matches Marek’s steps, foreclosing her old life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the walking ritual’s deepening cadence reweights stakes through tangible cause (footsteps) and effect (shutters rattling, mortar sweating), with cost legible in "tears chart[ing] undiscovered routes."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobblestones function as essential micro-setting, constraining choice from the hesitant cadence to the reborn town "keeping time." Their evolution—from "only heartbeat left" to active participants in revival—charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate by concretely shaping tactics (walking rhythm rebuilds Varin) rather than serving as generic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is masterful: the walking rhythm’s intensifying drone narrows Lira’s options from seeking maps to embodied action, with visible cost in her tears and transformed identity. Yet the trade-off lacks granularity—her choice to stay feels inevitable without showing the specific sacrifice of her cartographer self beyond the thematic whisper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through visceral particulars: "heartbreak was the seed of hope" and the fork’s hum reweight "rebuild" as shared rhythm, not maps. The final image ("the town kept time") resonates as a non-literal answer to revival, avoiding moralizing while charging prior material—Lira’s tears become "undiscovered routes," proving earned wisdom through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Lira’s tactile focus ("heat in the ground like coals under ash"), with rhythmic control mirroring the walking cadence. Minor abstraction in "recalled from memory’s edge" slightly dulls immediacy, but the voice remains cohesive under pressure, teaching its pattern early ("cobblestones remembered his footsteps") and paying off in the final choreography.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("shutters sighed like spent tongues") with propulsion, but "children’s laughter... quivered like stored lightning" risks mixed metaphor, slightly muddling the peak beat. No loops or scaffold, yet this borderline image in the transformation scene prevents 9+ by faintly obscuring the closure’s emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing walking rhythm with sonic rebirth—a fresh, non-obvious angle where "rebuild" becomes embodied cadence. The transformation feels inevitable: Varin’s revival hinges on footsteps, not nostalgia, with emotional specificity in Lira’s cartographer-to-walker shift, avoiding template tropes through concrete stakes (the tuning fork’s silent demand).</comment>
