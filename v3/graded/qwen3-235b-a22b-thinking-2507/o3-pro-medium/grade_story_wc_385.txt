<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "blessed or cursed" realization and pact acceptance, but the inciting decision to leave the gorge lacks micro-choices showing conflicting impulses; "driven by her motive" tells rather than dramatizes the pivotal escalation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with visceral cost ("reed-blown melancholy fluttered through her ribs"), but the transition from gorge to nexus slightly softens escalation under the Accumulative lens despite strong density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: canyon echoes shape perception, shell pulse guides movement, and chamber petals vibrate with negotiation; the fissure-revealing countdown and cooled shell at closure prove indispensable environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Silva's agency—following shell, descending, negotiating—with stakes crystallizing when echoes become "memories seeking mouths"; the pact's cost ("memories that were none of her own") is unmistakable and reconfigures her vocation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the final "grateful silence" answers "why some people echo" by showing released memories, avoiding moralizing; the "communal well" metaphor evolves organically from fear to sacred duty without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("senses harmonics like night animals scent springs") and rhythmic compression under pressure ("Driven by her motive... she descended") showcase masterful voice control; only minor over-articulation in "blessed or cursed" slightly disrupts intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; every line advances atmosphere or stakes with crystalline propulsion ("the shell warmed, and a fissure split"); figurative language ("throat becoming a communal well") serves character without muddling the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms echo tropes through specific memory-theory synthesis; the pact's cost ("memories that were none of her own") avoids cliché by tying to throat-centric imagery, though the "webs of intrigue" motif leans slightly generic.</comment>
