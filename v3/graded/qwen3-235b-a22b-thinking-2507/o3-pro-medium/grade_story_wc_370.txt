<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Lowell "wanted to retreat" yet stays, his empathy overriding fear; embodied emotion in tracing creases "like fault lines" avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to carry paradox outward earns closure through prior micro-choices like listening to footsteps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: streets "polished enough to mirror his silhouette" reweights isolation with visible cost of abandoning hiding. Accumulative lens holds—density builds through paradoxes until the ledger's final image crystallizes options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mirrored ledger charges the final image by constraining Lowell's choice (clutch vs. share) and recharging the opening rain motif. Sensory details like "lanterns copying breathing cadence" are selective and character-particular, avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile watchmaker specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when stewardship warning ("wisdom grows only when shared") forces Lowell's micro-choice to reject hiding. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens culminates in the ledger's physical weight against his chest—a felt cost that reconfigures his orbit of regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "nested paradoxes" as concrete practice, not abstraction; final image of streets mirroring Lowell reweights regret into shared wisdom without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite attendant's exposition by grounding insight in the ledger's tactile presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature is flawless: watchmaker's precision shapes "lanterns copying breathing cadence" observations. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in fragmented sentences ("Confused, he traced...") during discovery, with no head-hopping despite attendant's presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "polished streets" final line recharges opening rain with conceptual density. Minor register drift in "enlarged tranquility" (-0.1) but never muddles closure—every phrase like "clocks chiming out of phase" serves dual atmospheric/character purposes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms secret society trope through astronomy failure specificity; "mirrored covers" detail creates fresh inflection by charging closure. Avoids derivative premise via Lowell’s watchmaker lens—conceptual integrity shines when clocks’ "soothing chord" resolves his internal conflict.</comment>
