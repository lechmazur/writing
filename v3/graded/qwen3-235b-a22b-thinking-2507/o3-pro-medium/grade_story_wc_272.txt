<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "guilt painted him back" and surrender vs capture impulse; embodied emotion via "wet linen" and "salt-burn" avoids cliché; micro-choice of stepping into water forecloses capture path with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "fractured worlds can be art if one accepts the cracks as contours" reconfigures meaning with surrender cost; Accumulative lens holds as water rise tightens pressure; minor deduction for silver fish resolution slightly softening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (trapdoor descent, water pooling); brine-spotted volumes and kelp-ribboned tarot card charge the final image; environment shapes tactics when walls "breathe inward" during storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (mending fractured reality) tightens through water rising and library door slamming shut; Elias's agency drives escalation to the trapdoor descent; cost of surrender made unmistakable when he "let the card drift" amid rising tide.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image "cracks as contours" offers resonant non-literal answer to "world breaking or perception threshold?" without moralizing; complexity preserved through simultaneous wound/bandage realization; avoids thematic echo via lived experience over assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "light remembered being a bruise" and gulls-as-thoughts; rhythmic control shifts from languid ("shelves curved with stone") to staccato ("thunder punched the glass"); minor deduction for "luminescent ache" repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "spilled silver fish that swam upward" doing triple duty; no figurative muddle despite rich imagery; "velvet wings" closure phrase crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms artistic-breakdown trope via tarot/painting fusion; barnacled mirror shards creating "wound and bandage" duality feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
