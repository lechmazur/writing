<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action: "lungs tight" during giggle, not fear labels. Contradictory impulses (curiosity over fear) drive the vault descent. Final choice to play recordings earned by her sworn duty to protect voices, with visible cost in the conceptual weight of remembrance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: sensory density (mist, drips, pulses) tightens pressure without causal beats. Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—"the vulnerable were heard"—as city sirens pause and mist vibrates. Orientation clear by paragraph 2 with who/where/when anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting object (hearing aid) constrains the climax: bleeding lantern power into dead batteries recharges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under pressure—crisis narrows to bone-conducted giggles. Final "vigilant hush" charges the opening "reeling hush" with irreplaceable environmental weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (protecting vulnerable voices) signaled immediately; pressure accumulates through sensory deepening (ticks→giggle→dripping coordinates). Escalation driven by Mira's agency: her adjustment of the hearing aid narrows options to the vault. Conceptual cost legible in "remembrance" reweighting the boy's call at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: preserved seeds with speakers, not abstraction. Final image ("leaving only music for the ghosts and seedlings") reweights the opening hush as resonant remembrance without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character articulates the thesis, only shows its cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "paper husks" for lily pads and bone-conducted giggles. Rhythm modulates perfectly: short staccato during tension ("Lungs tight"), fluid during discovery. "Reeling hush" evolves meaning from disorientation to vigilance without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "water dripping onto glass, spelling patterns" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Textural specificity ("feathered photograph edges," "metal sighing like a relieved elder") replaces generic description. Final line "hearing every living heart" charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bioacoustics experiments transform ghost tropes into emotional truth. "Incidental heroism" redefined through Mira's duty, not grand gestures. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—the vault's hum vibrates the city's mist without gimmickry.</comment>
