<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Iria's hesitation between revolution and consequence; "cities rioting, libraries burning" embodies cost without label-speak. Slightly underdeveloped flaw in "dynasty ender" label limits inevitability of her choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost in "cities rioting, libraries burning" under Accumulative lens. Sensory pattern buildup (creaks, drafts) tightens pressure credibly without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sepia reading room constrains choice through copper-caged gramophone and fresco mechanics. Wax cylinder's physicality charges final image: "pocketed the wax cylinder along with its heresy" reweights setting's power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake tightening crystallizes when harmonic overtones reveal fraud, forcing Iria's renunciation. Cost legible in "children pressed into new anthems"; agency drives escalation through listening, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "knowledge carried in bone" vs "broadcast in brass" without moralizing. Final image of silent spinning record reweights truth's burden non-literally, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "standing waves inside her mind" and braille-like ledger touch. Rhythmic control under pressure ("tension quivered like caged thunder") with zero head-hopping or scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "golden shadows folding like curtains" demonstrates textural specificity. Minor register drift in "eloquently silent" (overly poetic for archivist) prevents 9.0, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archive trope through gramophone mechanics and intuition-as-bridge. "Revolution without sound" crystallizes fresh inflection: truth as unspooled potential, not explosive act.</comment>
