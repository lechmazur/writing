<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in micro-choices: "rational truffle forager" using methodology to calm "galloping confession reflex" while voicing fear. Final choice to share relic knowledge with Mara earns safety-through-community with visible cost ("tasted copper as he nodded"). No diagnostic labels; tears "amplified inside me until I almost drowned" shows embodied trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "discord felt woven into a larger, forgiving chord" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable cost ("storms would return, empathy would still bruise"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density until the orchard's creaking shifts to "parental rocking." Persistent price (speaking feared memory) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Hanging orchard actively constrains choices: "braided cables" become handrails during ascent, "fungal humps" yield truffles transformed into "offerings." Final image charges micro-setting when truffles "knock like two hearts agreeing"—environment directly reweights the fractured grace theme. No generic description; every detail serves pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (psychological safety) tightens through protagonist agency: Ilya's choice to press the eye under his tongue forces confession of abandonment. Visible cost ("hiss of panic recede from his veins") alters tactics—seeking solitude shifts to community planning. Escalation culminates in Mara's warning, making council threat tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "kindness was the missing brace" evolves into "filtered despair so that care could pass unharmed," culminating in truffles "knocking like two hearts agreeing." Final image rejects tidy resolution ("grace fused with the fracture") while offering non-literal answer to "fractured grace" premise—no moralizing, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature rooted in truffle foraging: notices "fungal humps," "wet parchment" smells, and orchard "creaking like pendulums." Syntax modulates under pressure—confession scene uses sparse fragments ("Words surged, unstoppable") while calm moments flow lyrically. Mara's dialogue stays in Ilya's sensory frame ("cheeks scarred by forced sincerity").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; peak beats avoid overwriting: "tasting rust and orchard mold" compresses sensory/emotional stakes. Final line’s "two hearts agreeing" avoids cliché through concrete action. One near-loop ("galloping confession reflex... told the ravine aloud") barely dents propulsion. Figurative language ("doves wrapped in cloth") stays grounded in physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms empathy tropes through specific worldbuilding: glass eye isn’t cure but "scaffolding," truffle foraging knowledge enables spore-based healing. Emotional truth in "her tears amplified inside me until I almost drowned" avoids therapy-speak. Risk-taking in quiet closure where "discord" becomes "forgiving chord" without erasing fracture—fresh synthesis of trauma and community.</comment>
