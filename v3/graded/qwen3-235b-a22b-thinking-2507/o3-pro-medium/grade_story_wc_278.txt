<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lin’s guilt versus hope ("expected triumph, but absence rushed in"), with embodied choices like pricking his finger. However, firmware backstory leans toward summary without sufficient present-micro-choice tilt per BRR, slightly weakening motivation escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the amber’s glow and baby’s ordinary cry reconfigure Lin’s guilt with visceral cost ("absence rushed in like deep water"). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through meteor-hush cadence shifts, with orientation anchored by "laboratory of lost sounds" at 42 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The amber constrains every key choice—from ritual execution to final archive—and charges the ending’s "faint gold" glow. Micro-setting mastery: Lin’s constellation tattoos shift from guilt-mapping to "gentle galaxies," directly altering tactics and final image under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early ("hush the dissonance of old guilt"), with escalation driven purely by Lin’s agency: following letters, scrawling constellations, tethering. Cost is unmistakable in the "cathedral after bells" void, narrowing options to irreversible renunciation of his ghost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment>Thematic resonance emerges solely through particulars: the amber’s imprisoned gnat reweights grief as archivable matter, culminating in the baby’s laugh as "forgiveness" without moralizing. No abstract statements; closure’s "ordinary plaintive ululation" offers earned, non-literal absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lin’s perceptual signature ("circuits inside him twitch," "silver ink constellations") filters all detail through a tattooist’s tactile precision. Rhythmic control peaks during ritual ("Sound vanished, like the air itself forgot vibration"), with compression taught early via "time folded" lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "meteor hush around him like velvet remorse" exemplifies high-density metaphor serving accumulative pressure. Final image ("baby laughed, forgiveness") achieves propulsion without clutter, though "cathedral after bells" slightly risks abstraction in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech guilt and tactile ritual: firmware haunting becomes physical tethering via amber. Bold risk in Accumulative structure—no causal beats, yet stakes intensify through cadence shifts ("whispers thickened" to "meteor still")—elevating emotional truth beyond genre tropes.</comment>
