<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aurora's "factually mystical" tension; embodied regret via coin-sparks and kintsugi metaphors avoids abstraction. Final choice earned by prior causality (her dismissal sent Jory into the storm), but Jory's near-silent return slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: footprints crystallize options with undeniable cost (Jory's charcoal state). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—density intensifies via alchemical acts, culminating in the coin's reforging. Rain easing mirrors guilt unbound, charging the final aurora.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The foundry constrains every choice (furnace for melting coin, slag heaps for climax); rain-washed specificity evolves with the narrative. Ceramic jar transitions from tea vessel to alchemical crucible, charging the final image with "old guilt finally unbound" as water trails away.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Aurora’s agency: melting the coin narrows options to confession. Cost is visceral—Jory’s "fingertips crumbling like charcoal"—and the mirror symbol forces her to "witness every crack." No coincidence resolves; the alloy’s snarl/sing progression earns the climax under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi-as-action: "sealing fractures with luminous admission" reweights redemption. Avoids moralizing, but Jory’s "true alloy of their names" line edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining earned ambiguity in the final tear-coins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is alchemist-sharp: "auric memory," "molten rune," "furnace lamps flicker." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences during coin-melting, lyrical flow at dawn. Zero head-hopping; even Jory’s rasped dialogue carries subtext without breaking Aurora’s POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sparks freeze in midair" propels closure without muddle. Figurative language ("gold threads run through fractures") serves character and stakes. Minor density risk in "auric memory prickle," but justified by POV lexicon and paid off in the final "doubled heft" coin.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Alchemy/kintsugi fusion transforms redemption tropes: the mirror symbol reframes self-reflection as active repair. Fresh inflection in "luminous regret gleaming brighter than furnace"—avoids sentimentality by tying emotion to physical gold. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
