<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "subdued ardor of someone mending porcelain" embodies her grief-to-purpose shift without diagnostic labels. Micro-choices like self-inking the stencil reveal values under pressure, culminating in earned tears "out of space made for tomorrow" with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "she finally cried, not out of ache" crystallizes her transformation while dawn breaks the twilight sky. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the stencil's return and swans' feedback loop tighten stakes through density, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: dome mechanics constrain choices (yawning open at night), while lanterns brightening "without oil" directly charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy stays jeweler-specific—"black gold," "compass gimbals"—avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lenore's agency: folding swans transforms passive grief into active cartography, reweighting "navigable sky" stakes when returned ivy sprouts. Cost is unmistakable—"healed arm" and backward-ticking watch pay tangible price under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "withering to bloom" isn't stated but enacted via ivy sprouting and lockets turning toward hope. Final line—"genuinely artificial star hammered from absence"—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is jewelers' precision: "fingers trembling with unspent grief" filters sky as "permanently twilight." Rhythm modulates under pressure—dream sequence's fluid cadence vs. clipped "She copied the numbers" during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks: "lanterns brightened without oil, as though determined to illuminate her pain" advances plot, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language stays precise ("knots on the same thread") with no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy and grief through jeweler's craft transforms tropes: mourning brooches become compass lockets that "spin only when speaking buried sorrow." Risk-taking (observatory as her body) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
