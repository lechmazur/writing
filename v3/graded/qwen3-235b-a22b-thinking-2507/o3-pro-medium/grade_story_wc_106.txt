<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (e.g., hollowing chest when moments vanish), but Mara’s flaw ("hoarding") lacks concrete prior manifestation; the younger-self reveal deepens motivation retroactively rather than driving active choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Mara steps through the argent door, with felt cost in her hollowed chest and released moments. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through atmospheric density shifts, though the boy’s identity reveal risks coincidence in crystallizing stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emerald station’s moonlight actively constrains choices—rail hum guides Mara’s uncorking decision, and the "fabled" setting transforms from backdrop to buyer. Final image (sunset never fleeting inside door) recharges the golden-hour motif with irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating sensory pressure (whistles → prophecies) narrows options until jar opening becomes inevitable. Cost is legible in Mara’s hollowed chest, but the dominant stake (trading moments) resolves without tangible tradeoff—releasing moments feels passive rather than a hard-won choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: stolen moments rejoining owners reweights "theft" as liberation. Final image (stepping through door) offers non-literal answer to "bargaining for time," rejecting transactional logic without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("world washed copper," "whistles drifted like questions"); syntax mirrors Mara’s tension (short phrases at climax). Zero POV drift—lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density without muddle ("pocketed them like contraband constellations"), but "frosted the air with silver promise" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat. Final line’s rhythm crystallizes closure without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "time theft" trope through specific mechanics (flower codes, graphite sigils) and emotional truth in Mara’s hoarding/letting-go arc. The emerald station as sentient buyer feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
