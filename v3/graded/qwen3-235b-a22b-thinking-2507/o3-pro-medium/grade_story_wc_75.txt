<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Iclea's embodied fear ("hands trembling like reeds") and contradictory impulses (dread vs. memory-driven resolve) earn her pivotal choice; Meris' protest reveals secondary pressure without flattening stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "drafting themselves back into history" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("fading initials") under Accumulative lens; rosewater dread's persistence proves cost isn't erased.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The emerald lens and bread ovens function as micro-setting that charges the final image; "initials baking golden" reweights prior decay through tactile, lived-in craft details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the lens reveals fading initials (visible cost), driving Iclea's agency toward bread-making; the "dripping wax" image transforms abstract fear into irreversible loss under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fading initials" as non-literal answer to cultural erosion; avoids moralizing by having the bread ritual charge the final image ("thawed melodies echo") without stating the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet gloom," "dough beneath a baker's knuckles") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in "Flour, song, and chisel chips would mingle" during high-stakes decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "phantom crust and honey" risks abstraction but is anchored by prior bread memory; no figurative muddle in peak beats despite dense imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms displacement trope through specific grotto logic (waterfall freeze threat) and irreplaceable bread-initial ritual; avoids safety-middle via Meris' resource protest.</comment>
