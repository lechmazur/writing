<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "neither hopeful nor cynical" stance; embodied via knuckles black with sealant during critical action. "Stoic wonder" avoids therapy-speak by anchoring in concrete pipe work. Slight deduction: motivation edges toward abstraction despite strong action alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly with "hope equaled flow multiplied by orientation" equation. Cost legible in "knuckles black with sealant" and pumps "coughed awake" – physical toll of resurrection. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through drip-to-solar-sail progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Terminal functions as micro-setting: sugar-clogged greywater lines constrain choices, while atrium's eastern skylight directly charges final image. "Caramel sigh" of stagnant water exemplifies purpose-driven specificity. Sextant's fractal shadows transform setting into compass rose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake (resurrecting hope through plumbing) tightens when Milo trusts "drips over quarrelling schematics." Agency clear in conduit splicing, but cost – though physical – lacks sufficient emotional weight in peak beat. Sugar-water's viscosity waking pumps shows earned consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hydraulic metaphor: "hope equaled flow multiplied by orientation" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image (stars finishing work) answers central question through concrete action – syrup dissolving into vapor becomes hope's viscosity. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in engineer's gaze: "hasty cabling formed a sketch of branching rivers." Rhythmic control peaks with "thin streams hissed through root channels" during pressure. Zero head-hopping; "caramel sigh" exemplifies purposeful compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dissolving caramel residue into sweet-smelling vapor" does triple duty (sensory/action/theme). Final line’s "stars finish the work" avoids closure muddle. Minor deduction: "functionally creative" slightly drifts from otherwise concrete lexicon in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of civil engineering and hope-as-hydraulics feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes: sextant’s microdegree marks casting "fractal shadows" transforms navigation trope. Avoids safety middle via sugar-water’s viscosity as literal/emotional catalyst.</comment>
