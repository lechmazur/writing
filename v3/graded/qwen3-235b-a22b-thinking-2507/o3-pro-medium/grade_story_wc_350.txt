<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("vigorous tender resolve") manifests in concrete micro-choices like borrowing the weight despite cost; embodied emotion via "voice rippling over wound seams" avoids labels. Final renunciation of precision for unity earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "borrowed starlight clause would expire" crystallizes cost while "bridges where grain once divided" reconfigures meaning. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (languages/vibrations) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cuckoo weight functions as micro-setting—constrains choice (crippling bell) and charges final image ("timbers pulse like bass drums"). Grain elevator's rot directly shapes rehabilitation tactics, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: "dawn threatened... performance had to commence now" forces irreversible action. Cost ("cripple a minor bell") visibly alters tactics (borrowing weight), reweighting unity over precision under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"stitching phonemes as rivets" reweights "bridges not walls" without moralizing. Final image ("valley listened, discovering bridges") offers resonant answer to central question via grain-to-bridge transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cataloged melodies on invisible staves") modulates rhythm with pressure; multilingual fragments taught early pay off in climax. No head-hopping; lyrical compression remains legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("multilingual stammer stitched with rust") with clear propulsion. Slight metaphor muddle ("sunrise hidden under feathers") in one line avoids closure impact; final line recharges "borrowed starlight" with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "choral librarian" rehabilitating structures avoids tropes; risk-taking (buildings as singers) heightens stakes coherently. Transformation test passed: swapping "silos" would break grain/memory motif's causal role.</comment>
