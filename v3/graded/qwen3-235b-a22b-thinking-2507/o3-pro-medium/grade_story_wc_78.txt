<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (duty vs. storm pressure) and embodied emotion ("bones vibrated with restless euphony"), but "restless euphony" edges toward label-speak in peak beats, slightly undermining visceral impact during the storm climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "orchard settle into a quieter key but still afloat" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost ("obstacles would always rise"), and the accumulative lens holds through density escalation (storm's roar modulating into stunned hush) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Driftwood circle and xylophone mallet constrain choices (tapping chains, sparking notes), charging the final image ("mallet hummed in her palm"), though "luminant pears" leans generic while pear leaves as hi-hats exemplifies purposeful sensory constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density (wind scratches threatening chaos) deepens the dominant stake organically; Mira's agency in rewiring turbulence into counterpoint forecloses safety with visible cost (cracking driftwood slabs chiming like bells), perfectly fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (chains→dancers, fractures→bells), with the final image ("tomorrow's score already gathered in the cirrus") reweighting "Sketched Resonance" non-literally, though "truth was simpler" risks thematic echo by nearly stating the moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read clouds as copper staves") and rhythmic control shine, but modern terms like "dub" and "remix" create subtle register drift against the lyrical voice during high-pressure storm sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion ("hammered the mallet... pitching sparks") is marred by mixed metaphors ("wind scratches threatened to skip her composition") and template cadence in the storm beat, dulling closure's clarity with minor figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music/weather/orchard avoids tropes through specific constraints (fractals generating sub-melodies), but "fractal generating spell" feels jargon-y; risk-taking heightens stakes via rewired turbulence without gimmickry.</comment>
