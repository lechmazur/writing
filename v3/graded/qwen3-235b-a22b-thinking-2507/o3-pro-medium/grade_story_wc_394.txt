<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in bargaining with acid sea while risking corrosion; "irreverent awe" manifests as micro-choices (jokes to acid, snapping fingers at insolent idea) rather than label. Closure choice earned through prior causality of lost prototypes and algorithmic guidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: bell's hum calms acid sea and triggers rusted buoys' response, reconfiguring "hearing" as communication with things. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—density peaks in "vibration thickened until newborn bell coughed out impossible chord" with environmental cost visible on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Acid sea actively constrains choices (lost prototypes, bargaining jokes) and charges closure by rippling then calming. Workshop gears aren't backdrop but "nervous teeth" awaiting dentist, with vats supplying voids that directly enable the bell's creation and final hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density: arrow setup deepens stakes from theoretical ("ring bell no one hears") to tangible vibration that alters acid sea. Cost unmistakable in "bell had called to things, not people" with environmental consequence—rippled acid calming proves conceptual price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("rustled buoys answered with sympathetic rings") offers resonant non-literal answer to "why summon unheard chimes?" by reweighting communication beyond human perception. Zero moralizing; thematic complexity emerges through particulars like "mischievous enough to be holy" without resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "gears tremored like nervous teeth" and "citrus fumes"—Liora's selective noticing filters all description. Rhythmic control peaks during climax: short clauses ("She snapped her fingers") accelerate tension before "hum gathered like bees behind glass" slows tempo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in repetitive "Throughout the evolution" phrases (-0.3), but propulsion remains strong. Zero closure artifacts; "coughed out a low impossible chord" exemplifies high-density imagery. No synonym churn—every phrase advances metallurgy or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "yearning algorithm" as brass rods calculating desires transforms inventor trope. Conceptual integrity shines in bell calling "to things, not people"—specific, non-obvious angle on communication that avoids abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
