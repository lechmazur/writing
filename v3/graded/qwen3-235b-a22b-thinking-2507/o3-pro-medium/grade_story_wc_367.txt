<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mora’s interior contradiction (caution vs. hunger to shape dawn) drives micro-choices like wick rotation; embodied emotion ("tasted metal on the air") avoids labels. Herald’s motivation remains opaque despite strong voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("relieved and condemned," "fed on yesterday"); accumulative lens holds through density buildup. No flaws in causality or orientation—anchors by line 3, cost legible in stewardship burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald prism functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("steered shadows toward first lines"), but fails 9+ gate: no constraint on Mora’s tactics beyond thematic resonance. Lighthouse descriptions vivid yet passive in key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Escalation via deepening—unborn mornings map intensifies pressure through protagonist agency (wick rotation), with visible cost ("fed on yesterday"). Stakes crystallize cleanly under accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shadowed elation" and "inkless letters," resolving in final image’s non-literal answer: stewardship as perpetual cost. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "unwritten day" without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt and flickering plans," "drummed a tempo") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in "laughter skipping between thunderclaps." Elision (herald’s departure) taught early, paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silica threads" is sole minor register drift in peak beat. Propulsion flawless ("rain began, each droplet reflecting...") with high density. Final line recharges "shadowed elation" motif without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper + narrative stewardship via "total internal reflection." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; "shadowed elation" transforms tropes through specific, verifiable detail in closure.</comment>
