<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "anxious elation" and hesitation before self-mutilation; embodied scars as "ports" to plant dreams root motivation in tangible cost. Final choice earned by prior communion mechanics but motivation ("find intersection of dreams") remains slightly abstract without deeper character-specific friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: covenant's thin arc of light crystallizes renegotiation with visible cost (blood/sap mingling, ground trembling). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (cobalt air, shivering leaves) culminating in irreversible reconfiguration where stakes (eclipse vs. spiral) reweight meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Body as micro-setting constrains choice: scars enable communion, then become the blueprint for the spiral redesign. Final image of white-line scars on skin mirroring the path charges closure by making the covenant's cost tactile. Environment (cobalt glade's "dateless twilight") directly pressures the ritual's timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring eclipsed covenant) tightens via Lysander's agency: hesitation then self-inflicted spiral forecloses "trapping souls" paths. Cost is visceral—blood/sap mingling, ground trembling—and reshapes the maze's essence. Pressure grows through sensory accumulation (roots tightening, leaves shivering) rather than causal beats, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: spiral redesign answers "How unweave maze without uprooting memories?" without moralizing. Final image of "dawn that arrived precisely on time" reweights covenant as living reciprocity, not abstract ideal. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in scar tissue and hedge geometry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: "tungsten-tinged light," "chlorophyll filaments like tiny lanterns" filter world through Lysander’s plant-connected psyche. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short phrases during pain ("Pain lanced, clean and bright")—with no head-hopping. Slight register drift in "coercive hedges" risks academic diction but stays voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion stumbles only in two high-pressure beats: "tungsten-tinged light" feels forced, and "chlorophyll filaments that pulsed like tiny lanterns" overwrites sensory clarity. Otherwise, zero loops; "blood mingled with sap" compresses consequence perfectly. Final line’s "dawn that arrived precisely on time" charges closure with crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magical gardener" trope via scar-tissue cartography and covenant as living pact. Emotional truth anchors novelty: Lysander’s "anxious elation" mirrors reader tension. Synthesis feels inevitable—the spiral solution arises from prior scar mechanics, not gimmickry. Risks poetic density but coherence holds through charged specificity (crimson sap constellations).</comment>
