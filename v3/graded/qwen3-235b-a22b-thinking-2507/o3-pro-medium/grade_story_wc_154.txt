<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "shrewdly innocent" appears as diagnostic label without embodied tradeoffs. Boy remains symbolic vessel rather than individual. Final choice earned but lacks visible struggle in pivotal decryption beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "softer metronome" crystallizes options with cost ("guns kept time"). Accumulative escalation via acrostic discovery reweights coral's meaning. Cost proof: "night still unforgiving" juxtaposed against "map of echoing hearts."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (unknotting vines while decrypting) and charges final image ("vines dripped... atrium seemed to unknot"). Coral fragment's condensation mirrors "ceiling fires," turning wounds into constellations with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's decryption agency: acrostic discovery ("R-E-G-R-O-W") deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens. Cost legible when shellfire interrupts with "rattled loose plaster," forcing throat-tightening "lotus-hearted ache" that alters final whisper delivery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral regrowth metaphor and overlapping messages ("snow melt"/"feed the sea"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "broken" as "pattern" without abstraction. No thematic echo; "treaty drafted in chalk" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "language tasted of gunpowder" shows linguistic trauma. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (short sentences during shellfire). Slight abstraction in "lotus-hearted ache" redeemed by "flower asked to bloom in smoke" embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "chalky beneath gauze" shows injury without telling. Single flaw: "shrewdly innocent" functions as diagnostic label in high-pressure decryption beat, slightly dulling immediacy (-0.4 per Q7 rules).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms war-torn setting via coral regrowth metaphor. "Treaty drafted in chalk" synthesizes physical/emotional stakes uniquely. Risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
