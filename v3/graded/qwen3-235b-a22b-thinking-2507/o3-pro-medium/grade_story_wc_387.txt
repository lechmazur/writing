<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "demure audacity" and embodied choices (studying foam before speaking). Final renunciation—gathering droplets to "keep the universe from unraveling"—is earned by prior causality with visible cost as dawn replaces moon paths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options when "scholar, astronomer, sailors... formed a single net," with cost legible in "careful not to lose a single droplet" as sunrise ends their work. Accumulative lens holds via pattern density tightening toward moonset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The silk net constrains choices (must be "thin enough not to disturb" reflections) and charges closure—droplets "telling the night's story" reweights "hidden effort" with undeniable cost. Micro-setting mastery: fireflies' brevity pressures their race against dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Hai-rin's agency proposes the harbor net test, changing knowledge ("reflection drifts faster"). Cost is unmistakable in sailors' "strained arms" and the temporal price of dawn, narrowing options to a single decisive observation window.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fireflies' "heartbeat of light" and sailors' strained arms, culminating in the resonant final image: droplets preserving the night's story reweights "hidden effort" without moralizing. Avoids all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Hai-rin notices textures (silk, foam spirals) while Zhen sees celestial patterns. Rhythmic control peaks at moonset—"Silence fell except for the whisper..."—compressing diction under pressure without losing lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies purpose (e.g., "firefly season embroidered... winked like mischievous scribes" fuses setting, time pressure, and theme). Final line's rhythm charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: net-mending directly enables cosmic observation. Emotional truth in sailors' strained arms becoming visible "hidden effort." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
