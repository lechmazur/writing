<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's "charmed skeptic" interiority is concrete and contradictory ("skepticism anchored her while wonder peeled back disguise"), with embodied emotion avoiding labels. Micro-choices under pressure—placing the shell, accepting whispers—reveal hierarchy of values through the brother's memory spillage. Final choice to carry memory rather than quarantine it is causally earned by resonance revelations, with visible cost in "sorrow surged, but her motivation burned brighter." No diagnostic language; flaws (skepticism vs yearning) compound authentically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "harmonic tremors curtained the air" onward, with density increase (memory panels spilling) reweighting stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: "independence was not absence of voices..." crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("sorrow surged"). Cost is unmistakable in the grief spillage altering tactics—she shifts from archiving to carrying. Orientation anchors instantly ("velvet garden at twilight"), and lens named by midpoint ("resonance structures").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The whispering seashell (micro-setting) constrains choices—its knitting fracture forces Mara to accept brother's farewell—and charges the final image ("whispers now clear, not coaxing"). Garden actively pressures: hedges seal isolation, pedestal's "moonlit veins" enable memory projection. Sensory details filtered through archivist POV ("petals drank indigo dusk") avoid symbolism, with tactile specificity ("pocket lined with velvet, far warmer than chill"). Meets 9+ gate: recurring object shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quarantined memory) signaled early via legends. Escalation is Mara's deepening engagement: shell's whispers peak doubt, then resonance structures force memory confrontation, narrowing options to archive or carry. Cost is visceral in "grief... spilled like thawing rivers," altering her tactics toward acceptance. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves conflict; brother's sacrifice is dramatized revelation, not off-stage convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "archive whatever she found, not consume it" reframed as "carry him forward instead of leaving behind." Final image ("fountains fell silent... archived within her footsteps") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—"independence... freedom to choose how chorus shapes march" is earned through memory sequence. Complexity embraced: quarantine isn't evil, but independence "tasting of abandonment" shows meaningful tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist's precision ("half warmer than chill in chest") modulates to poetic under stress ("harmonic tremors curtained the air"). Rhythmic control in climax: short clauses ("She watched but did not drown") amid lyrical density. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally (e.g., "ghostly resolve" to embodied "ribcage" ripple). Patterned elision taught early ("broken whispering seashell half") and paid off in closure's conversational whispers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("ribbon of unexamined yearning twitched" conveys emotion + backstory). Figurative language sparse in high-pressure beats (memory uses clear "projected... lantern shadows"). Final line's "resonance structure still writing its score" recharges motif without muddle. Opening ("petals drank indigo dusk") and closing lines anchor voice with concrete propulsion—no weak modifiers or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "garden of memories" trope through archivist lens—"quarantined memory" made fresh by profession-specific stakes. Emotional truth in "translate isolation into independence without amputating love" avoids binary. Transformation test: swapping "archivist" for generic seeker would break core metaphor. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes—"velvet garden" specificity resists generic, with "fountains fell silent" charging closure through character action.</comment>
