<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("certify wonder") lacks deep personal roots; flawless execution avoids genuine struggle or contradictory impulses. Micro-choices under pressure (waiting for emerald ripple) are strong, but no visible flaw compounds choices beyond technical precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("threshold poised between stillness and song") crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost: failure means "generations would forget wonder." Accumulative lens holds perfectly; cost legible in "hollow echo" consequence and physical "peppered silver" sensation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern actively constrains choices (narrowing corridor, melting hush cubes) and charges closure via "bell made of marble and dawn." Micro-setting mastery: amber sheet’s "thawing icicle" edges directly alter tactics during unfurling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Harmona’s agency: each bell choice deepens the hush’s transformation (cubes→pools→threshold). Stakes tighten relentlessly toward felt cost—"hollow echo" consequence made visceral through "lungs filled with peppered silver."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: final image ("wonder was, is, and must remain essential") earned by the door statue’s reconfiguration. Avoids moralizing; complexity lies in wonder as active practice ("oscillating repose"), not abstract ideal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exceptional—synesthesia creates unique POV ("tasted hush as winter honey"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short, chime-like sentences during bell-ringing. Only minor flaw: "oscillating repose" exposition slightly disrupts flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "spinning yellows that smelled of lemons cracked by frost" shows multisensory density. One minor redundancy: "crystalline drip" slightly echoes "drip" in "drip by crystalline drip," but rhythm overrides.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope via synesthetic mechanics ("ultraviolet fermata"). Emotional specificity avoids abstraction: wonder’s fragility made physical through "bedraggled browns" air. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
