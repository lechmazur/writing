<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict underdeveloped; "trembling hands" shows embodied cost yet contradictory impulses lack scene integration during pivotal unsealing. No meaningful tradeoffs from telepathy beyond utility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost ("old bones protesting," dissolving resin), but decoding process lacks causal tightening—geothermal ferns' aid feels convenient rather than escalating pressure under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcanic springs actively constrain choices: scalding water tests resolve, bioluminescent fungi guide dive, steam aids decoding. Final image ("hot springs sighed in approval") charges closure through micro-setting evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment><comment>Dominant stake (evolving tradition) clear, but physical pressure plateaus—reconstruction's "hammers echoing" creates subtle time pressure yet no tangible cost alters tactics during dive. "Old bones protesting" is the sole embodied escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "implanted destiny" vs. tradition, avoiding moralizing. Final image (child thriving with plants whispering) reweights evolution as harmony, but genetic engineering's ethical complexity remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sulfurous mists curled like forgotten dreams") sustains under pressure. Minor register drift in "cryptic script etched in faded ink" risks overwriting, yet rhythmic control anchors volcanic urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("bubbles popped like secrets surfacing"), but "trembling hands" cliché and redundant "whisper unbidden thoughts" scaffold dilute climax. No closure-touched artifacts, yet near-miss figurative muddle in decoding scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of plant telepathy and genetic destiny avoids tropes, yet "implanted destiny" concept lacks non-obvious moral calculus. Bold risk in quiet closure pays off, but derivative echoes of Prometheus myth slightly diminish singularity.</comment>
