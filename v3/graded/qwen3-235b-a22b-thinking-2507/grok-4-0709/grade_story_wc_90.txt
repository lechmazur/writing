<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's pacifism manifests concretely through "stitching not striking" during shadow confrontations, with embodied contradictions (suppressed rage vs. mending actions). Final integration earns her transformation, though emotional progression feels slightly tidy in the three-photo sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: portal blooming with "ghostly figures emerging" reconfigures stakes with visible cost (emotional labor of shadow integration). Accumulative lens holds through patterned deepening, though repetitive photo structure slightly dilutes escalation pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Photographs with "crystalline traces" of dried tears function as micro-setting that constrains choices (must stitch tears to progress) and charges closure (tears refract into portal map). Final image of Lira floating through "compassionate dawn" directly reweights this object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulative deepening: each photograph confrontation narrows options by forcing integration of specific shadows (sorrow → isolation → self). Cost is unmistakable in Lira's buoyancy shifts, though the three-step rhythm risks predictability at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "stitching rather than destroy" embodies pacifism's labor. Final image of rebirth "without strife" reweights prior struggle without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through visceral imagery ("tears refracting into a map").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lira's focus on "emotional imprints" and "shimmering" tears. Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure (e.g., shortening during shadow emergence), though occasional poetic phrasing risks distancing in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but minor overwriting in descriptive clusters ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears... crystalline traces that caught the dim light") slightly dilutes momentum. Zero loops, though density approaches purple prose in archive room setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism with gravitational buoyancy creates organic stakes. Risk-taking heightens coherence: "lighter when happy" isn't gimmick but essential to closure's image. Emotional specificity ("mended the mother's sorrow with her own buried grief") avoids generic templates.</comment>
