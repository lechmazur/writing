<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (inherited guilt vs. desire for release) drives every choice; embodied emotion in trembling hands gathering charred diaries. Slight over-reliance on "sensitively perceptive" label without fresh embodiment during peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure as Charged Poise when corridor "sighs" releases echoes, making legacy burden "shared narrative" with felt cost. Film negative discovery edges toward coincidence but pays off through atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy actively muzzles sound and claws at clothes, constraining movement; salt-decay air directly ties flooding to sensory experience. Fireplace ash lacks specific texture to charge final image beyond "cold and ashen" generality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through atmospheric accumulation: echoes reveal distortions → hidden chamber → diaries → negative strip. Each layer deepens legacy burden's cost. Film negative's late arrival slightly weakens causal pressure despite thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from charred diaries' physicality and negative strip's inverted light—not abstract moralizing. Final image ("chart not just echoes, but redemptions") reweights "walls' dreams" without stating thesis. Near-miss with "echoes of regret" bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("resonators humming faintly," "ivy clawed at her clothes"). Template cadence in two adjacent "She" sentences ("She paused... She emerged") slightly dulls pressure during transition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "scent of decay and salt, a reminder of how shifts had turned rivers into invaders" has minor paraphrase redundancy. High density where "half-burned diaries" simultaneously advance plot, character, and theme without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms climate collapse trope via unique corridor echo cartographer lens. "Forbidden love" in diaries feels stock, but negative strip's inverted images provide fresh, non-obvious synthesis that reweights legacy burden.</comment>
