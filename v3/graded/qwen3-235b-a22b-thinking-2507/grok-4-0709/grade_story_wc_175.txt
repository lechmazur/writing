<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in honoring histories versus orchestrating outcomes is embodied through micro-choices (knotting then releasing), but "esoteric realist" remains a label without tangible constraints on actions; the monarch's interruption catalyzes earned renunciation with visible cost in loosening roots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: monarch's perch crystallizes stance shift with felt cost (transient roots pulling free), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where density intensifies through disrupted cadence; orientation anchors by line 20 satisfy the test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting—dew-heavy vines and moth wing directly constrain construction choices, charging the final image as the archway sways under butterfly weight; sensory details avoid cliché by filtering through Elias' purpose-driven perception of "spectral narratives."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) tightens through protagonist agency when the monarch's interruption forces relinquishing control; cost legibility hinges on Elias' blushing realization and loosening roots, though escalation relies heavily on coincidence rather than causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moth wing's integration and monarch's disruption, rejecting tidy resolution for "unfinished" harmony; final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though "esoteric imbalances" risks abstraction without deeper grounding in tangible consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in botanical precision ("petals blushing pink," "veined like esoteric constellations"), but rhythmic control fractures under pressure—repetitive "blushing stillness" dilutes climax impact despite otherwise controlled lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overwritten repetitions ("blushing stillness" ×3) and template cadence in high-pressure beats ("With careful fingers... humming... notes rose") dull immediacy; final paragraph's filter-verb stack ("Elias felt... loosening... ready") triggers the -0.5 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ingenuity in fusing ephemeral art with ecological elegy feels specific and necessary, but derivative "last monarch" trope lacks fresh inflection; risk-taking with lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though closure's quiet wisdom edges toward safety.</comment>
