<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as "haunted ambitions stir; they were not mere ghosts but seeds," transforming grief into actionable resolve. Embodied emotion in "trembling hands" avoids therapy-speak, though "haunted by ambitions" edges toward label phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "no longer haunted" reveals grief transformed, not erased, as Mira's essence becomes "perpetual transition." Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density escalation in the sapling's growth sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor actively constrains choices—floating leaf requires kneeling, ethereal soil enables growth—and charges the final image where "her essence lingered in the arbor's pull." Every detail serves the transition motif without postcard passivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: "liminal hush" pressure crystallizes agency as Elias maps analogies, culminating in the irreversible planting. Cost is visceral—grief transmuted but enduring—proving "visible price that charges the final image" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "touching distance" evolves from physical gap to resonant final image of "forever close yet ethereally apart." Zero moralizing; the sapling's glow reweights transition as shared ambition, not loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles: scholarly ("cuneiform runes"), tactile ("dug with fingers"), physics-minded ("magnetic forces"). Minor slip—"haunted ambitions" slightly over-tells—but voice modulates perfectly from grief to peace through rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmered like stardust" avoids purple prose through context. Final line’s "perpetual transition" multiplies purpose while resolving momentum. Figurative language stays precise even in high-pressure beats like the fruit’s consumption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through physics-poetics synthesis: magnetic arbor isn’t decorative but conceptual engine. Emotional truth in "no longer haunted" (not cured, transformed) avoids sentimentality. Risky Accumulative structure pays off via disciplined texture.</comment>
