<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks embodied friction; "luminous absence" remains thematic label rather than concrete micro-choices under pressure during the photography climax. Backstory summary about vanished lover doesn't alter present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "tears blurred her view" and dissolved dream pulled from "runaway edges." Final image reconfigures absence into reclaimed light with conceptual cost paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: watercolor palette constrains photography method and charges final image as "talisman of reclaimed light." Archipelago's whispers pressure choices (guiding winds) while library's "velvet depths" enable escape, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (capturing dream) deepens through protagonist agency, but pressure lacks textural escalation; archipelago's whispers remain static rather than intensifying during photography. Cost visible in tears but no felt trade-off in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through golden-light lover image without moralizing, but final library-sharing line ("dreams could be vitalized anew") risks thematic echo by stating resonance rather than letting the reclaimed light image stand.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shelves groaned under sea-weathered leather" and "winds carried faint murmurs." Syntax modulates perfectly from contemplative library prose to staccato photography rhythm ("camera clicking in heartbeat") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-claustrophobic figurative density in climax ("rays into vibrant strokes," "symbols shimmering") risks muddle but serves Accumulative lens. Minor synonym churn in "vitalizing the dream frame by frame" slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lost love" trope through specific sunrise photography mechanics, but "luminous absence" phrasing leans on familiar lyrical abstraction. Bold synthesis of watercolor cipher and dream-vitalization lacks one fresh inflection in emotional calculus.</comment>
