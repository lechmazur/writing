<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in metamorphosis struggle ("fought it... but fortune's words echoed"), yet human form loss lacks specific embodied cost beyond "fear." Micro-choice anchoring (touching tree → cracking pod) earns credibility, but grief's physicality remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: hybrid form crystallizes with felt cost ("heart beating in sync with Thorne's revived pulse"). Lens is Accumulative/Textural (sensory density → cosmic intimacy), holding through final soar. Cost proof clear in "reluctant metamorphosis completing" and stabilized hybrid state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard's paradoxically steady bloom charges closure ("eternally blooming in paradoxical steadiness"), constraining Elara's turmoil. Sensory specificity excels (cinnamon laced with stardust), though moonfire-saffron feels decorative. Final image's blooming orchard reweights prior fragility with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reforging bond beyond death) tightens via spice ritual escalation, narrowing options to metamorphosis. Cost is visceral in "feathers emerged, limbs elongating." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but reluctance-to-surrender shift lacks micro-tactical cost (e.g., discarded human tool).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-as-constancy resonates through orchard's rhythm and hybrid form without moralizing. Final image reweights "paradoxically steady" with earned complexity: blooming orchard now witnessed by a being who embraced change. Avoids thematic echo despite fortune cookie's direct phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("voice a bridge between wild hearts") modulates from grief to cosmic intimacy. Rhythmic control intensifies during ritual ("vapors swirled, Elara chanted"). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early (time "folded like petals") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose sings with textural specificity ("crystalline pod dangled"), but "cosmic intimacy" repeats mechanically (para 4, 7). Near-closure beat avoids loops, though "intoxicating and profound" borders on purple. Final line's recharged motif ("eternally blooming") escapes scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "beast whisperer" trope through specific metamorphosis stakes and orchard's paradox. Emotional truth in grief-to-surrender arc avoids generic rebirth clichés. Risk-taking (fortune cookie in fairy tale) elevates via charged reprise, though cookie's modernity slightly jars cohesion.</comment>
