<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lir's frustration ("frustration edging his mental tone") leans slightly toward labeled emotion rather than fully embodied contradiction, but Elara's withholding as both teaching method and personal stake earns credible change through the revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with visible cost in Lir's transformation ("Lir emerged changed"), though Elara's personal stake revelation timing slightly delays the pressure peak before payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto actively constrains choices (stone manifestation, wave warping) and charges the final image ("sycamore hush lingering"), with micro-setting (visionary pond) directly shaping the pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation through Lir's frustration ("Why do you hold back?") narrowing options to forced revelation is driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens, with unmistakable cost in Lir's prior ignorance transforming into earned patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pond ripples and Elara's reversal without moralizing; the final "sycamore hush" image offers resonant non-literal answer to "vanishing to appear" by reweighting the teaching method's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("starlight intensified in their vision") and rhythmic control shine under pressure, with trance-state compression taught early and paid off in the crystallized closure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; minor density dip in "manifested from the grotto's magnetic pull" slightly over-explains the vision but avoids muddling the pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Backwards aging transformed through pedagogical withholding and magnetic grotto physics creates fresh synthesis; the "stone in pond" method feels inevitable in hindsight while heightening stakes via patience.</comment>
