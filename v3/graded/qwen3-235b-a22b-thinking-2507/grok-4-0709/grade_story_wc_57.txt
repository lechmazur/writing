<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete actions like "whispering questions to the rope," avoiding therapy-speak. But lacks contradictory impulses—Elias’s patience is unwavering, missing micro-choices that would heighten stakes under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("snow gathered on his shoulders") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Lens ambiguity past midpoint slightly weakens escalation; weaver’s appearance edges toward coincidence rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden dock and fulgurite glass function as micro-setting, constraining choices (knot-decoding in fog) and charging the final image. "Oceanic hush" permeates sensory detail without cliché, though snow’s role could deepen beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving knowledge) tightens through Elias’s decoding, with visible cost in physical endurance. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—the weaver’s arrival feels passive, missing agency in forcing the final trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through seeds as "tiny universes" and knots as "ancient runes," avoiding moralizing. Final enchanted seed reweights preservation as embodied wisdom, not abstraction—resonant without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fulgurite refracting light into spectral hues") modulates with tension. Minor register drift in "ethereal beings" slightly clashes with collector’s voice, but rhythmic control under pressure is masterful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; "salt-crusted and frayed" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("frozen electricity" implied twice), but propulsion remains crystalline. Final image avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "mythical guardians" trope via textile-based wisdom and knot-decoding mechanics. Fresh synthesis where fulgurite glass and rope feel indispensable—risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
