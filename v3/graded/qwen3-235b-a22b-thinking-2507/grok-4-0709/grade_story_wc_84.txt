<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motivation (home fragmented by war) but lacks contradictory impulses; "perpetual surprise" is shown via repeated physical reactions yet remains a label without internal conflict. Final choice to pilot toward home is earned but cost feels light for the war backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: pilgrim's arrival → chip presentation → star trail sequence → decoded frequency. Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly with felt cost ("pilgrim smiled... Elara knew this was her beginning"). Orientation anchors by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid "brilliant dimness" descriptions but observatory setting functions as postcard backdrop; no environmental constraint on choices (drone operations would work identically elsewhere). Tool (drone) lacks integration beyond plot function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding frequency) escalates causally through fragment retrieval, narrowing options to completing the chip. Visible cost in pilgrim's departure and Elara's solitary new journey. Agency strong but pressure lacks tangible opposition beyond time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Frequency of belonging" theme emerges organically through the chip's reconstruction; final image ("pull of belonging stronger than ever") reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality but "missing pieces" concept borders on on-the-nose symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (drone-pilot precision in "sharp eyes scanned," "anomalies others might miss") with rhythmic control. Stress moments maintain articulate diction unnaturally ("voice steady despite surprise flickering"), slightly undermining authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but "perpetual surprise" recurs 4× as repetitive scaffold, peaking in closure beat where emotional intensity should compress language. Filter-verb stacks ("her eyes widening," "face lighting up") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial cartography and emotional resonance via type foundry chip. "Star trails as luminous threads" elevates trope, but "frequency of belonging" feels familiar. Risk-taking in object-as-theme avoids gimmickry through causal integration.</comment>
