<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation (boredom seeking "after-goodbye") but interiority remains abstract; "boredom tempered by knowledge" reads as diagnostic label-speak at closure, undermining embodied contradiction. No contradictory impulses manifest in scene choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost—amulet shatters—but "boredom tempered" lacks visceral legibility. Orientation succeeds early, yet cost proof falters: emotional consequence feels intellectualized, not felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite described vividly but never constrains choice; corridors bend yet offer no tactical limitation. Final image ("hushed echoes") remains abstract, failing 9+ gate requiring environment to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally via solar storm’s intensifying pressure, but agency feels passive—"this was her chance" frames opportunity as coincidence. Cost (shattered amulet) lacks tangible impact on enduring immortality, weakening trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "after-goodbye" quest, but final line’s "ponder the hushed echoes" skirts moralizing. Avoids direct statement yet "boredom tempered" risks sentimentality, diluting earned ambiguity about immortality’s true cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice ("hushed thunder," "spatial mutiny") modulates under pressure, but participial cadence loops ("Kneeling...", "Extending...") in climax dull immediacy. Perceptual signature remains consistent despite rhythmic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High density succeeds ("fractured light and shadowed crystals"), yet "hushed thunder" repetition crosses into scaffold—four uses dilute tension without pattern payoff. No closure artifacts, but near-duplicate phrasing ("whispered thunder"/"hushed thunderclap") impedes propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"After-goodbye" premise transforms immortality tropes through specific spatial metaphysics, but solar-storm catalyst feels familiar. Emotional truth elevates it, yet safety-hedging avoids risking deeper despair in closure.</comment>
