<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (elusiveness vs promise) drives the climax, but "premonitions" lack embodied specificity during the rock placement; curse manifests as vague "flickering visions" without physical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Elara's anchoring forecloses escape with visible cost ("elusiveness waned"), under Accumulative lens where pattern density crystallizes stakes; tidal forces reconfigure options irrevocably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tidal bluff constrains choice (rocks must adhere to frictionless edge), while "borrowed dawn" light charges the final image; aurora's "false light" directly enables rock painting and dust ignition, shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when placing the 8th rock: elusiveness vs revelation crystallizes under Accumulative pressure, but cost ("anchor her") remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt until the final paragraph's "rooted yet free" resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "embrace the slide" realization reweights prior struggle without moralizing; sacred patterns shift from restoration goal to harmony acceptance, charged by the eels' circling approval.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed dawn," mathematical metaphors) modulates under pressure; rhythmic control intensifies during rock placement with purposeful elision of the curse's physical toll.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: "glimpses of futures haunting her like shadows in borrowed dawn" risks figurative density, but final image ("stand still on the bluff") delivers clarity and propulsion without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical spirituality and physics; "friction as borrowed grip" premise transforms tropes through specific tidal/eel logic, with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
