<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via trembling hands amid resolve, but "after forgiving yourself—for herself—" is diagnostic label-speak mid-crisis, triggering anti-pattern penalty. Embodied emotion strong ("technically gentle hands pressing to her chest") yet backstory feels told, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost (tears, emotional thaw), but "after forgiving yourself" repetition creates scaffold loop that slightly dulls the final image's resonance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory build to resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum actively constrains choices (frost-stiffened rope, aurora as light source) and charges closure with kaleidoscopic runes. Micro-setting triumph: punched card scrap evolves from relic to tactile guide, making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names) tightens through rope reconfiguration, but lacks meaningful complication—pressure escalates linearly without deepening knowledge or narrowing options beyond the single act. Visible cost (emotional thaw) feels earned yet doesn't alter tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "transcribed memory" mechanics, avoiding moralizing. Final image (names echoing eternally) reweights oblivion without stating a moral, though "snowmelt ardor" borders on thematic echo in peak beats, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora's light into resonant patterns") and rhythmic control under pressure, but filter-verb stacks ("clutched," "studied," "began") cluster in paragraph 4, dulling immediacy. Voice remains consistent through emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with zero figurative muddle, but paraphrase loop in paragraph 5 ("guilt into resolve... self-reproach chain... snowmelt ardor") restates emotional shift redundantly. Closure beat pristine; artifacts don't touch final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes lost-wax casting with punched-card tech into fresh cultural preservation ritual. "Technically gentle" attribute transforms trope through specific craft constraints, though aurora/ice setting lacks bold risk-taking beyond vivid execution.</comment>
