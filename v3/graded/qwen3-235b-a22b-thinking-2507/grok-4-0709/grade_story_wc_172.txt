<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (greed/sentiment) clear but climax lacks embodied struggle; "amoral philanthropist" label over-tells rather than dramatizes internal fracture during valve turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds with visible cost ("ruin profits, expose schemes") but echo causing rain weakens causal lens; thunder's "resumption" feels coincidental rather than earned consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Salt flat dissolving into "fractured grace" charges final image powerfully, yet setting remains observational backdrop—no physical constraints shape Elias's valve search or egg-cracking tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Profit vs redemption stake tightens meaningfully at valve turn with irreversible cost, but internal conflict lacks visceral escalation; no hesitation or physical struggle during pivotal release action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("salt flat bloomed in chaos... echoing birdsong in every ripple") resonates non-literally with cost, avoiding moralizing while answering "can greed harbor redemption?" through ecological rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid perceptual signature ("crystalline crust," "iridescent sheen") but "fractured grace" repetition (3x) disrupts rhythmic control; voice remains consistent under pressure without tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density ("thunder rumbled faintly, then hushed") yet scaffold loop: "fractured grace" appears verbatim in paragraphs 4, 6, 7, dulling closure's emotional charge despite strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological guilt and redemption through extinct species; avoids sentimentality by focusing on aurora swift's echo rather than human victims, with specific shamanic preservation detail.</comment>
