<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids label-speak ("eternal loss," "shattered ethereal heart"); embodied grief in "final breath still haunted him" shows contradictory impulses. But micro-choices lack visible hierarchy during ritual—naming feels automatic, not pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: gathering crystals maps fears while honoring sacrifice, with felt cost in "heartbroken reaper finding solace." Accumulative lens holds; one deepening (light intensifying fears) suffices for length. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atlas page constrains choice (ritual surface) and charges closure ("constellation on the atlas page"). Sea monsters' inked "undulating" forms mirror internal fears—environment directly shapes the crystallization stakes without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (naming fears to honor loss) tighten through light-intensification, narrowing options to ritual completion. Agency-driven escalation; cost is visceral in "heartbreak eased fractionally." Lacks one micro-choice showing sacrifice during naming (e.g., hesitation over "Void's Whisper").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystallized fears ("Despair's Grasp," "Fate's Shackle"), not moralizing. Final image reweights grief as "quiet legacy"—resonant non-literal answer. Avoids sentimentality but could deepen moral calculus (e.g., cost of avoiding fear vs. confronting it).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows that whispered," "prisms humming") reflects reaper's grief. Voice modulates from "distant intimacy" to ritual urgency. Slight register drift in "core concept" (academic diction) disrupts POV lexicon mid-pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("kaleidoscope of colors dancing across the atlas page"). But "prisms humming" overwrites—violates physical logic (prisms don’t hum) in peak beat, slightly dulling closure’s crystallization imagery. Otherwise flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: reaper mythology fused with psychological ritual (naming fears via light). Sea monsters as fear-generators feel inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("atlas page with sea monsters") anchors universality.</comment>
