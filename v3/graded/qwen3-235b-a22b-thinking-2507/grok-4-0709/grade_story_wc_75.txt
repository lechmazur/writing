<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Elara's historical focus drives action but no visible struggle between preservation and immediate survival needs weakens micro-choice tension at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("fragile victory"), but the beekeeper's shadow threat remains abstract rather than dramatized consequence; Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto environment actively constrains tactics (oven pipes thawing spring) and charges final image where waterfall mist transforms from "eternal" dread to hope carrier; rosewater motif evolves organically through crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under Accumulative lens (frozen spring → baking → thaw), but the cost of cultural erosion remains slightly abstract despite tangible bread-sharing; one tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through initialed breads and lens-filtered community rebirth; avoids moralizing with final line "woven tighter by history's gentle hand" earning resonance through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("floral unease like rosewater masking dread") modulates perfectly under stress; rhythmic control in "dread softened, rosewater yielding to hope" crystallizes turning point without telling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "perfumed fear knotting her throat" shows embodied tension; only marginal risk in "rosewater yielding to hope" saved by active verb avoiding sentimentality in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms refugee tropes via specific cultural mechanics (initial breads, opera lens); avoids safety middle but thaw resolution slightly neater than plausibility allows for cultural revival depth.</comment>
