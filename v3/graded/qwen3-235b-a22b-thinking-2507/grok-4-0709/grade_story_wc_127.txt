<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("cataloging anomalies like a ledger of souls"); embodied contradiction in "affectionate detachment" toward past self. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses at climax—subsumption feels too smooth for high-band 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "stars piercing... mirroring harmonized sparks" reweights half-truths with visible cost (her ethereal transformation). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; static electricity pattern intensifies meaningfully to final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains choice (charged air enables static method) and charges closure (stars mirroring harmonized sparks). Fossilized resin walls literally trap time, embodying the theme—micro-setting essential to tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through one deepening: erratic sparks pulled into core fuse insight/empathy, narrowing options to transformation. Cost is visible in physical metamorphosis ("flesh to ethereal"), but escalation lacks a distinct micro-turn to push beyond 8.8.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory reconfiguration (discordant sparks → calm river), not moralizing. Final image reweights "half truths" without stating a moral—resonant ambiguity in "elevated, not erased." Avoids thematic echo despite high concept density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("cataloging sparks like a ledger of souls"); rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during subsumption). Slight register drift in "subsume" (clinical vs mystical voice), but consistent focalization anchors the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sparks dancing like fireflies" serves static motif without muddle. Overwriting near climax ("bittersweet longing... shadowed by inevitable loss") slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat ("calm river") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fragrance chemistry literalizes emotional alchemy. "Blotter petal" transforms trope into indispensable tool. Risk-taking (static electricity as emotional sensor) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure hinges on its specificity.</comment>
