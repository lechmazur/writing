<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses in action; "ambition fulfilled" feels declared rather than earned through struggle, with no visible micro-choices under pressure during the bloom’s eruption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds—enduring the stench forecloses fleeing with felt cost ("breathed it in, finding... strange purity")—but the cost isn’t deepened enough to reach 9.0; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density peaking at bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid treetop atmosphere lacks constraint on choices; the corpse flower’s stench draws villagers but as coincidence, not environmental pressure, missing the 9+ gate for setting charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (serenity amid chaos) tightens through sensory accumulation, but escalation isn’t driven by Elara’s agency—the bloom erupts passively, weakening cost legibility despite her endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("turned repulsion into revelation") violates organic emergence; the moralizing summary undercuts earned resonance, triggering a −0.7 penalty for explicit final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("olfactorily sensitive nose," "wildflower hush") shines, but minor POV leakage ("village’s unrest... inhabitants debated") and clinical register ("cadaverous odor") slightly disrupt focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong lyrical rhythm falters with minor paraphrase loops ("swirling patterns" repeated) and scaffold in transitions ("As days blurred..."), dulling momentum without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh corpse flower metaphor for resilience lacks bold risk-taking; emotional specificity avoids templates, but "serenity within motion" feels familiar without a non-obvious synthesis for 9.0.</comment>
