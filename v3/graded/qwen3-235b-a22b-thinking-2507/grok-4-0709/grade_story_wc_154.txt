<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (shrewdly innocent vs. buried terrors) shown through coral/cast interaction; micro-choices like tracing smudged ink reveal hierarchy of values. "Lotus-hearted ache" borders on therapy-speak but redeemed by embodied cost in final transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "hope transformed into gentle light" crystallizes options with visible cost (shared anxieties becoming seeds). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory/emotional density, not causality. Mist lift at twilight reweights stakes without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atrium’s mist and coral fragment constrain choice (anesthetic-blurred focus aids decryption) and charge final image. "Vine-draped arches like whispered secrets" avoids cliché through character-specific perception. Micro-setting (cast notes) essential but atrium itself remains postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear of unhealed wounds) tightens via decryption deepening—Amir’s cast smudges transform into sister’s poem. Cost legible in "emotional knots still tight" and final "seeds in fertile dusk." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral/cast duality: "wounds grow roots, then flowers" reweights shrapnel scars without moralizing. Final image ("talisman against fear") offers resonant answer to "can old wounds bear hope?" Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in Amir’s confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "shrewdly innocent" voice modulates from "feigned naivety" to warmth. Rhythmic control in decryption scene ("faded ink like a map of hidden paths") teaches pattern. Minor register drift in "labyrinthine grooves" slightly exceeds translator’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion but minor synonym churn ("tangled minds"/"emotional knots") in shrapnel reference. "Tender sorrow blooming" risks purple prose yet redeemed by context. Final line’s "enduring light" avoids closure muddle through concrete reprise of coral’s symbolism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: brain coral (typically oceanic symbol) recontextualized as conflict-zone artifact. Avoids war-story tropes via quiet atrium setting. Risk-taking in passive protagonist succeeds—Elena’s translation work becomes active emotional grafting, transforming generic "hope" into specific "seeds in fertile dusk."</comment>
