<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on thematic labels ("empathy burned within her") triggering diagnostic-speak penalty; contradictory impulses (waiting vs. acting) exist but lack visceral embodiment during high-pressure mending. Final choice feels earned through mirror sequences, yet emotional cost remains abstract despite visible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: pressure intensifies via density of mirror glimpses (child→elder→warriors), reweighting stakes through patterned emotional deepening. Charged Poise closure crystallizes options with felt cost in "weighted breath" tension and shadows "trailing like resolve," though Council's abstract verdict slightly dilutes consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Attic mirrors function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (arranging circle, guiding shard reconstitution) and charges closure via "living map" orb. Ice floes provide atmosphere but never physically pressure Elara; "frozen apples" reprise with "nascent melt" in final image narrowly meets 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven deepening: each mirror glimpse reveals higher emotional stakes (hunger→isolation→violence), narrowing options via empathetic trade-offs. Cost is felt in "weighted breath" suspense and irreversible commitment ("shadows trailing like resolve"), though Council's external verdict risks coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete mirror visions (child's hunger → shared feasts), avoiding moralizing. Final image of "apples glistening with nascent melt" reweights ice motif with conceptual cost ("courage could thaw divides" slightly overstates but doesn't declare a moral).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "apples frozen mid-bloom" and "floe-dwellers" as "nomadic folk." Rhythmic control shines in compression during reconstitution ("First... Another... In a third"), though "shadows whispered intuitions" edges toward overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding; "empathy for their plights—starvation, isolation, loss—burned within her" contains diagnostic label-speak but avoids full penalty via embodied context. No template cadence; final line "floe below began to still" avoids sentimentality through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "shadow-laced peacekeeper" transforms tropes via concrete physiology (shadows as "tendrils" mending crystal), while "empathy onto action" avoids abstraction through resource-sharing pacts. Emotional specificity in "child's face, hollow with hunger" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
