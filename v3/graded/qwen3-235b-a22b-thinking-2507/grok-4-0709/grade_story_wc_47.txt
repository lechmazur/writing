<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (hiding yet rebuilding) through concrete micro-choices like arranging stones; "protected vulnerability" label triggers minor diagnostic penalty despite strong embodied emotion in drip-pattern observations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: pendant handover crystallizes options with visible cost ("weight lessened"), driven by Accumulative lens where drip patterns reweight meaning; orientation clear by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moss garden actively constrains choices (icicle drips as breadcrumb trail) and charges final image ("blooming like moss over forgotten circuits"); environment directly mirrors motivation via "moss binding fractured stone" metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through drip-pattern discovery, but "quietly proactive" trait remains told-not-shown until climax; agency drives escalation toward pendant handover with felt cost, though secondary pressure lags slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "honeyed hush" evolution from description to lived state; final image ("sweet graft of shared meaning") reweights trauma without moralizing, avoiding all thematic echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("watchful eyes," drip patterns as "forgotten algorithms") with rhythmic control; minor filter-verb stack ("she felt a protected vulnerability") barely avoids penalty in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats; "protected vulnerability" creates minor synonym churn but doesn't obscure closure; high density maintained through concrete verbs like "graft" and "proffer."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via tech-nature fusion; "moss binding stone" as specific, verifiable detail creates freshness; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
