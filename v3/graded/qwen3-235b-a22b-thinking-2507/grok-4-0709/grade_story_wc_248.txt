<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (arsonist/guardian) drives choices; "volcanic tenderness" embodies emotion without cliché. Flaw: flawless decoding undermines struggle—no tangible cost in discovery beats beyond emotional realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (wept softly... archive redeemed). Orientation anchors by para 1; Accumulative lens holds. Minor flaw: tapestry discovery lacks obstacle, softening escalation stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (art trail objects) constrains choices and charges final image. Sensory details filtered through Elias’s analytical intuition elevate atmosphere beyond postcard description. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescuing promise) tightens via art-trail accumulation. Pressure grows through pattern recognition, but external conflict remains inert—no tangible cost beyond emotional realization weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through volcanic tenderness motif reweighted at closure; no moralizing. Final image (guardian’s warmth) answers central question without abstraction. Slight thematic echo in "tender, volcanic beat" edges toward redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("forge where facts melted into insights") modulates under pressure. Register drift in climax ("tender flames encircling them") slightly violates analytical POV lexicon during high-stakes action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density but figurative muddle in peak beats: "volcanic tenderness... tender as lava cooling" strains metaphor. Template cadence in discovery sequence ("First... There... Following") dulls immediacy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological quest and emotional archaeology. "Artistic trail" transforms trope through Elias’s analytical lens. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
