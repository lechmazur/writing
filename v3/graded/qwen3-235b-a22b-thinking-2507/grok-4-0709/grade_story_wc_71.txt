<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction under pressure lacks depth; "creeping normality noticer" trait drives action yet feels abstract without embodied struggle during ritual climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (houses absorb human "shards of hush") with conceptual cost, but Accumulative/Textural lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—density shift lacks one explicit pattern break to elevate beyond 8.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bay setting actively constrains choices: moss-muffled footsteps and displaced objects (seashell, key) charge the final image; "shard of hush" concept transforms environment into thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder before normality erases it) tightens via ritual, but escalation lacks visible cost during pressure buildup—Elias' urgency feels intellectual rather than visceral until revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "shard of hush" metaphor; final image ("alive essence now a shared secret") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct "hushed blaze" perceptual signature sustains voice under pressure; rhythmic control in ritual sequence ("walls whispering faintly... resonated, shifting slightly") avoids lyric clichés.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in opening ("spring unfurled like a secret whispered among the willows") slightly dulls momentum, but final beats achieve zero scaffold with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism tropes through sensory specificity (orris root's "powdery scent"), though "alive houses" premise lacks bold risk-taking beyond genre conventions.</comment>
