<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; Elara's flawless execution avoids genuine struggle. "Lucidly watchful" is diagnostic label without embodied cost. Micro-choices lack emotional layering beyond serene focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "grotto's calm facade belying profound revitalization" crystallizes the felt price of serene upheaval. Accumulative lens holds through patterned trial balloons tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid tide-polished grotto descriptions lack causal constraint. Seashells/kelp serve as decorative tools but don't alter tactics—e.g., shell spiral causes "gentle quake" without changing Elara's methods.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through three trial balloons deepening Elara's calculus, but visible cost remains abstract. "Serene upheaval" implies strain yet lacks concrete forfeiture—no tool break or stamina loss to charge final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "hope as function of lucid watchfulness" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise via "forged hope's new calculus," though "puzzling out equations for hope" flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("logical dreamer" lens filters all description) with rhythmic control during balloon launches. "Lucidly watchful" slightly jars as diagnostic label but doesn't disrupt voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn: "serene upheaval" repeated 3x without deepening. "Trial balloons" phrasing slightly mechanical. No figurative muddle, but final line's "serene disruption" echoes earlier without escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of math/mysticism via "hope-altitude" gauge. Emotional truth in quiet perseverance elevates trope, though parallel timelines feel under-differentiated. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
