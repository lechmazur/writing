<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "diagnostic label-speak" in "understanding its price would be steep" triggers penalty. Final choice earned but simultaneous contradictory impulses lack scene embodiment despite redemption arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost ("eyes dimmed with exhaustion"), but Accumulative lens clarity delayed until comet imagery (midpoint). Orientation anchored by 100 words, yet lens ambiguity guardrail caps score despite strong cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: ebony clipboard constrains choices (ritual binding) and charges final image ("treaty anchored"). Terrace's runes and celestial timing actively pressure the ritual, avoiding postcard description through tactile, lived-in use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation passive—Elara follows ritual rather than driving agency under pressure. "Operatively gentle" trait lacks visible tradeoffs; redemption price felt but not actively chosen during muster, capping escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "flawed beauty" motif reweighted in final image without moralizing. Near-miss: "redemption's cost had been paid" skirts thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph penalty via concrete sacrifice imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals unfurling under slow dance") but filter verbs accumulate ("she had come," "she prepared"). Rhythm sags in ritual sequence yet recovers with final "gentle muster" resonance under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in ritual beats ("began... whispering... tracing") triggers scaffold penalty. Near-closure escape: "vitality siphoned" avoids figurative muddle, but synonym loops ("flawed beauty" repetition) disallow 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope via specific clipboard mechanics and spirit seals "like starlight on water." Derivative "forever war" premise redeemed by emotional specificity in exhaustion imagery, though world logic lacks depth.</comment>
