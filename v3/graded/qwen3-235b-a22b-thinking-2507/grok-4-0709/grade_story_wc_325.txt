<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alex’s claustrophobia manifests in embodied choices (gasping swim, narrowed corridors), not labels. Motivation crystallizes through micro-choices under pressure—clutching codex while phobia surges—to earn his final endurance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: souls fading amid "profound silence" reconfigures the crashing hush with conceptual cost (memory reclaimed). Causal lens holds flawlessly—tidal shifts drive each phase transition narrowing options toward the incantation’s surge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The tidal timeframe micro-setting actively constrains tactics (swim timing, vapor-to-ice shift), culminating in the final image’s "echo of crashing hush" charging the facility’s meaning. Every detail—from codex’s waterproof case to subzero air—shapes Alex’s choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake (free souls before tide shifts) escalates causally: liquid→vapor→solid phases narrow options while raising physical cost (cold breath, steam-choked panic). The receding tide’s "tremble" makes the cost undeniable as Alex conquers phobia.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the codex’s fading gold fleck and "crashing hush" repricing—no moralizing. Final image ("found a piece of himself") reweights "standing by unremembered" as memory’s embrace, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Spelunker POV defines perception: cables as "vital arteries," phobia "surging like a tide." Under stress, syntax shortens ("He plunged in"), while "dust motes" beam-slicing reveals Alex’s tactile focus—zero head-hopping or lexicon drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rustled terminals," "steam-filled antechamber" show don’t tell. Only minor density dip in steam chamber ("whispering forgotten names") slightly blurs immediacy—no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms cable-splicing history into soul-conduits via phase transitions. "Crashing hush" motif charges closure uniquely, avoiding trope reliance through facility-specific mechanics (cryo-units, tidal pockets) that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
