<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (chaos/time harmony) embodied in clock-hand clutching; "luminous ache" risks abstraction but anchored by wife's harvest-moon photo. Final choice earned via leaf-fall micro-choice, yet emotional resolution feels slightly over-tidy for high literary fiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: restructured clock creates legible before/after with felt cost ("luminous ache transformed"). Accumulative lens holds through tremor escalation, though seismic threat resolves too cleanly ("observatory held") muting tangible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lunar observatory functions as micro-setting: altitude-sustained oak tree directly enables climax (leaf fall), while moonlight bathes the final photo. Stone floor where leaf lands constrains the pivotal action, charging closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harnessing ephemeral) tightens through tremors→spinning clock→leaf fall under Accumulative lens. Agency strong in restructuring, but cost remains conceptual (emotional shift) without tangible sacrifice, limiting escalation depth despite precise pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: frozen leaf photograph becomes resonant answer to "taming time" without moralizing. Final image reweights moon's "changelessly constant orbit" with undeniable conceptual cost, avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes deepened by decades of stargazing") with rhythmic compression during tremors ("The oak quivered"). Minor register drift in "luminous ache" (repeated twice), but lyrical control under pressure remains masterful and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-loop in "luminous ache" → "radiant peace" in final beats; "frantic whirl/ceaseless motion" slight redundancy. Otherwise impeccable propulsion—no figurative muddle, with sentence rhythms mirroring tremor intensification and leaf-fall grace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "taming time" trope via camera-repairer lens: escape velocity as perceptual shift, not flight. Risky poetic density pays off through oak tree's earth-sky bridge, avoiding cliché with verifiable lunar observatory mechanics. Fresh inflection feels inevitable.</comment>
