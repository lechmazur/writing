<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in molting trait driving action (shedding "weary wanderer" for rebellion), but "fueled by motivation" slightly over-articulates internal state. Jax relationship crystallizes values with felt cost ("carrying only the coffee tin... hidden compartment for contraband hope").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (Jax's execution as "contraband hope"), but lens ambiguity pre-midpoint—shifts from causal (molting) to accumulative (memory layering)—triggers -0.4 penalty. Orientation clear by word 30 ("rusted library under stars").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coffee tin's false bottom and library cracks function as micro-setting that constrains choices (hiding seeds, planting in decay), charging the final image ("rusted library... now hummed with potential"). Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile details like "callused hands" on dented tin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's molt ("shedding the weary wanderer") and seed-planting action, but escalation lacks meaningful complication—the "rebel" motivation emerges without friction. Cost remains conceptual (Jax's death) rather than viscerally felt in present beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (scattering seeds beside poems), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "fracture" from brokenness to potential ("moon's glow sealing his vow"), but "forge beauty from anarchy" borders on over-explained. No thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight glinting off its lid like a fractured halo") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in climax ("eyes alight with fractured luminescence") slightly disrupts voice, but no POV leakage or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold; "luminous fractures" repetition (3x) skirts synonym churn but earns density through motif reweighting. Final beat clean ("ready to wander anew"), though "fractured luminescence" edges toward purple prose without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through specific details (penny poet, molting, coffee tin). Emotional truth in "gardener of anarchy" concept avoids cliché, but "fertile soil for beauty" risks abstract phrasing. One fresh inflection: anarchy as growth medium.</comment>
