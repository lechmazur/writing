<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "yearned for connection" edges toward label-speak; motivation clear though the burnt feather ritual lacks contradictory impulses in the pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the feather's softening char proves conceptual cost, but the respite's pressure lacks a tangible tightening beat before the ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere yet fails the 9+ gate; the ruins don't constrain choices (e.g., no currents hindering movement), reducing the environment to backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation, but the "isolation gnawed" conflict remains abstract; no visible price (like oxygen depletion) tightens tactics despite the sunrise deadline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "shadowseam wonder" reweights from mystery to belonging in the final breath, avoiding moralizing while charging the respite's glow with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice distinct with "shadowseam" lexicon, but "softly ingenious" disrupts POV plausibility—no astrologer would self-diagnose such a clinical trait mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in setup ("she was a landscape astrologer"); "veils of mystery" risks purple prose, though the final image’s "char softened" delivers crystalline propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Landscape astrologer" transforms tropes through specific marine cosmology, but the abyssal phoenix leans derivative; emotional truth in solitude elevates the synthesis beyond familiar myth.</comment>
