<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("intimately aloof" vs. buried sorrow) drives choices, but transformation feels slightly abrupt in grotto; embodied emotion strong until "nostalgia was a chain" veers toward thematic tell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: whispering the promise with shell's glow creates reconfigured stance; mirror's fracture bookends cost ("tears mingled with spring water"). Accumulative lens holds through cave's sensory escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cave network functions as micro-setting constraining choice: bioluminescent oasis's "temporary eternity" directly enables the revelation beat; quartz "frozen waves" charge final mirror reflection with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting grief) tightens via wrong turn's disorientation; cost legible in Elias's tears as he releases the shell. Agency slightly undercut by accidental cave discovery, but accumulation of pressure under textural lens suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "temporary eternity" reconfigured from cave illusion to lived present in final image. Avoids moralizing; "fractured mirror now reflected a man whole" resonates without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Painterly perceptual signature shines ("blending hues of twilight blues"), but "intimately aloof" feels authorial. Rhythmic control modulates beautifully from storm tension to oasis calm; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Hours feel like heartbeats" borders cliché; minor scaffold in "replaying fragments... veering off" weakens momentum. Otherwise high density: "veins of quartz that mimicked frozen waves" integrates setting/action flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "healing journey" trope through painter-specific details (seashell patterns, twilight blues). "Temporary eternity" concept feels fresh via bioluminescent oasis, avoiding derivative emotional arithmetic.</comment>
