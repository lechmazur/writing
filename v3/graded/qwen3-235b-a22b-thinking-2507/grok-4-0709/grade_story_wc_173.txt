<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation to defy conformity but lacks contradictory impulses; "bodily poetic" remains ornamental label without constraining action under pressure. Final endurance lacks visible cost—Elara succeeds unscathed despite implied wrath.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens (snow swirl reconfiguring serenity), but cost remains abstract. Fails cost proof test—no on-page consequence for releasing echoes beyond atmospheric shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid silver courtyard and prism imagery lack functional constraint; snow crunching and starlight don't pressure choices. Final image's "whirlwind of awakening" charges theme but environment doesn't shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (court's wrath) is declared but never tests Elara—pressure builds atmospherically without narrowing options. "Between sigh and smile" timeframe is poetic but fails as live clock altering her moves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through echo-harvesting ritual, but "dawn of change" finale edges toward stated moral. Resonant final image avoids sentimentality yet slightly over-explains the awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/sound focus) with rhythmic control under pressure. "Alarming serenity" motif modulates effectively, though elevated diction like "bodily poetic" occasionally distances focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Crippling synonym churn: "alarming serenity" (5x) and "bodily poetic" (4x) create paraphrase loops. Final beat's "whirlwind of awakening" suffers mixed metaphor (serenity shattering into wind), dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen court + echo harvesting, but "dawn of change" ending feels clichéd. Prism mechanics transform tropes, though risk-taking doesn't fully heighten stakes beyond atmospheric tension.</comment>
