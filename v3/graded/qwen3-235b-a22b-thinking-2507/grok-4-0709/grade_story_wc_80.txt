<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. dream-chasing) drive closure choice; "stoically sensitive" label slightly over-told but redeemed by embodied struggle in locket discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: sealing notes/locket forecloses his quest while becoming the archaeologist; cost legible in "tears pricked his eyes, but he remained stoic" during entombment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion actively constrains choices (water depth, drawbridge timing); inkwell's texture charges the final image as conduit for interlaced absence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via rising tide (live clock) and physical obstacles; locket discovery deepens knowledge, forcing reconfiguration of his grandfather's legacy into the closure act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of sealed notes reweights "interlaced absence" as active preservation—not passive loss—without moralizing; "binding interlaced absences into something whole" crystallizes the non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (surveyor's precision meets poetic sensitivity) modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "hushed blaze" metaphors during high-tide struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but scaffolded emotional labeling ("stoically sensitive, bearing weight") in paragraph 2; final "fire of unearthed dreams" slightly overwrought for peak intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" synthesizes erosion, memory, and lineage into fresh emotional calculus; risk-taking (archaeology as preservation via demolition) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
