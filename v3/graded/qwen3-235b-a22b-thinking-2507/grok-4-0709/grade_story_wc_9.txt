<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through choked breaths and blood-tasting thorns; final choice to trace Mira’s hand earns redemption through causal links to saucer ritual and childhood fracture, though "willingly perplexed" trait lacks active pressure during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: saucer’s widening crack absorbs pain to unfasten regret, crystallizing stakes with visible cost in "tears mingled with choking beauty." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but "willingly perplexed" concept dissipates during ritual escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glade’s "choking beauty" actively constrains choice—roses’ salt-tasting thorns force confrontation—while the cracked saucer charges the final image as "mended in spirit," fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through textural escalation: "invisible knot of regret" yields only via surrender, narrowing options to one path with felt cost (saucer’s widening crack). Agency drives resolution, but "willingly perplexed" motivation weakens during key ritual beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through saucer’s transformation: "mended in spirit" reweights lost time not as recovered but forgiven, avoiding moralizing. Final image’s "beauty transforming from suffocation to embrace" offers non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roses that tasted of salt and sorrow") modulates with stress; rhythmic control shines in ritual sequence. Slight register drift in "deliberate labyrinth" momentarily distances voice during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in "exhaling a choking beauty that tightened her throat" (redundant modifiers); "thorns drawing beads of blood that tasted of salt and sorrow" risks purple prose. Final image remains clear despite minor scaffold in reflection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartomancy and hand-tracing ritual transforms time-loss trope; emotional specificity in saucer’s crack as "absorbing pain" avoids abstraction. Hedging in "willingly perplexed" slightly dilutes risk, but glade’s sentient beauty elevates ingenuity.</comment>
