<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via spiral button (lost path) amid cataloging, but "raw possibility blooming" leans abstract; micro-choices under pressure (button sorting altering echo) earn high band despite slight emotional generalization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: cliffs groan "in release" as hourglass reverses, with amber cracking showing tangible cost of malleable time; Accumulative lens holds through button-echo pattern escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Amber warehouse constrains every choice (resin-embedded buttons, cracking prophecy slab); final "unearthed silence" recharged to "alive with quiet hum" charges closure through micro-setting evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through button cataloging (bone button flood story → crystal lovers' dreams), but "first tremors" lack causal escalation; cost is felt via prophecy slab's cracking yet physical danger remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "weave" revelation to final "prophecies were but echoes of choices"; avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in button-echo mechanics rather than direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber cracking under weight of newfound flexibility") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "raw possibility blooming" prevents 9.0 despite otherwise masterful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "murmured incoherently, a jumble of tones" contains subtle redundancy; final image remains razor-sharp despite this micro-artifact in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophecy mechanics through button cataloging feels inevitable; "canyon echo unscrambled by lost fasteners" transforms tropes via specific, tactile logic without gimmickry.</comment>
