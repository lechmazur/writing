<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in cyclical philosophy drives choices, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during Victor confrontation; calmness shown via micro-choice of markers yet emotions remain abstract ("perceptively calm" without visceral stress signals).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("paths circle back to teach resilience"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Causal) at midpoint slightly weakens escalation; cost legible in final image yet causal links feel under-tightened.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned train constrains choices (markers on perimeter) and charges closure ("testament to cycles understood"); foreign bills function as micro-setting that alters tactics, though some dusk descriptions verge on ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (keeping sanctuary) tighten via Victor's arrival, but confrontation lacks visceral pressure escalation; agency clear in dissuasion method yet cost remains conceptual rather than tactile, weakening peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bill markers reweighted as "symbols of global wanderings," avoiding moralizing; final image reconfigures cyclical premise with resilience cost, though "teach resilience" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dusk-filtered observations) anchors voice, but "polished calm" lexicon flattens under stress; lyrical compression works yet rhythmic control slips in reflective blocks ("perceptively calm" repetition).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops with strong propulsion, but "dusky harmony" cadence risks monotony; figurative density ("sleeping beast") serves atmosphere without muddling closure, though "well-oiled mechanism" verges on cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Startup/circus fusion transforms "cycles" trope through specific stakes (foreign bills as markers); risk-taking in quiet climax heightens coherence, yet emotional complexity lacks fresh inflection beyond premise.</comment>
