<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("wistful sighs," "pieced-together existence") with diagnostic phrasing ("mirroring her own pieced-together existence"); lacks contradictory impulses in peak stress. Motivation clear but micro-choices lack embodied tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure: "gliding over dunes... whole in her pieced-together soul" reconfigures stakes with felt cost (abandoned farm). Situational lens holds—magnetic shift forces stance crystallization—but resolution edges on coincidence (fire self-extinguishes too neatly).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dome and roses create vivid atmosphere but fail to constrain choices meaningfully; "strangely organic" trait is label-only. Micro-setting potential (box, roses) underutilized—final image ("guardian of roses and remembrances") charges closure but lacks prior causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save farm vs. inner chaos) signaled early. Escalation via magnetic shift tightens options, but "controlled burn" solution lacks tactical depth; cost (farm abandonment) is legible yet feels externally imposed rather than earned through protagonist agency under Situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" theme resonates through concrete actions (miniaturizing fears, integrated memories). Final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though "bridge to empathy" edges toward thematic echo in last paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline petals bloomed under artificial suns," "static-laced reverie") with rhythmic control. Filter verbs ("memories assaulted her") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; no head-hopping but psychic distance lacks modulation during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "memories assaulted her in fragments" is minor paraphrase loop. Figurative language ("corral wildfire into a lantern") avoids muddle. Final line’s poetic compression ("whole in her pieced-together soul") elevates closure without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh android-botanist fusion with emotional specificity, but magnetic shift trope feels derivative. Risk-taking (holographic fears as tangible chaos) heightens stakes, though "strangely organic" lacks transformative specificity. Transformation test passed via character-driven premise.</comment>
