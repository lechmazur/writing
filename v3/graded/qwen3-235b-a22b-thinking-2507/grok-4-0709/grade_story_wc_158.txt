<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interior contradiction lacks embodied tension; "shyly unstoppable" trait remains label-driven without visible tradeoffs during singing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("insomnia eased at last"), but temporal compression obscures escalation; accumulation lens holds though centuries-long process feels undifferentiated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shell setting actively constrains choices (amplifying sound for lullabies) and charges final image; reef-shadow nebula colors reconfigure closure with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through lullaby accumulation narrowing options, but agency feels passive; cost is conceptual (centuries of longing) rather than viscerally paid during reunion beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic abstraction ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") triggers echo penalty; final nebula-petal image avoids moralizing but wisdom feels imposed rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/shadow lexicon) sustains voice, but "shyly unstoppable" repetition creates tic-like rhythm; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Template cadence ("shyly unstoppable" variants) and stock metaphors ("thorns of suffering") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; final image rescues density with concrete nebula-flower fusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oceanic/celestial motifs elevates tropes, but "blossom armistice" concept leans on familiar poetic transformation without sufficient narrative risk-taking.</comment>
