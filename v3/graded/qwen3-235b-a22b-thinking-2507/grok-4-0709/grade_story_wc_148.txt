<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans thematic ("rebuild truth from scraps") rather than embodied conflict; contradictory impulses absent despite high stakes. Diagnostic label "hush" replaces concrete sensory struggle during pivotal confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmospheric density builds to Earned Stasis ("impossible calm sustained"). Cost legible in "bodies would soon be found" juxtaposed with serene repose, though pressure escalation lacks micro-tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison actively constrains choices (tide timing, spiral stairs mirroring labyrinth) and charges closure ("rowed away... repose remained"). Copperlight evolves from setting to thematic anchor, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("before bodies found") tightens options but remains abstract; no visible trade-off when Elias chooses confession. Agency evident but cost feels conceptual rather than tactical (e.g., no lost opportunity).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through copperlight/lattice motifs, but "redemption for liar's kin" resolves too tidily. Final image reweights legacy without earned ambiguity—ghosts fade cleanly, avoiding complex cost of inherited sin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "scuffs like Braille") sustains voice through pressure. Zero head-hopping; rhythmic control peaks in ghost vision sequence. Slight register drift in "repurposed as interrogation room" (non-POV lexicon).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("sky bled hues of burnished metal"). Elevated diction in "sustains impossibilities" slightly jars during high-pressure ghost encounter, but final image avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse-as-prison with legacy-of-lies premise. Risk-taking in ghost mechanics elevates stakes, but "hovering curse" resolution feels familiar. Emotional specificity in "spectral forms defying gravity" offsets trope reliance.</comment>
