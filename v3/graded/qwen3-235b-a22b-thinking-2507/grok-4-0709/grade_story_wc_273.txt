<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elowen's "serene anger" and albinism create embodied contradiction; micro-choice spilling ink shows hierarchy of values. But family backstory feels tacked-on exposition violating BRR, not altering tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (neural surge insight) with legible cost in "wild heart at peace," but saboteur confrontation deferred weakens tangible stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved spires actively constrain choices (shadowed pursuits for albinism); spilled ink as micro-setting charges final image. Drone feels tech-dropped without environmental integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ink-fade urgency, but escalation lacks visible price—saboteur threat vanishes after setup, leaving "calm rage" unresolved as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: vanishing ink → time perception insight. Final wind-whisper image reweights crisis metaphor without moralizing, achieving perfect earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("alabaster features," "calm rage coiled") shines, but "serene vortex" and "neural surge" drift into clinical diction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich rhythm with purposeful variation, but "breathing mandalas" overwrites and "fury simmered like distant storm" cliché muddles high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "time slows" trope through ink mechanics; albino tracker angle feels fresh. Drone slightly tropes but redeemed by specific brass/crystal detailing.</comment>
