<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "dream-chasing existence" versus newfound resolve; embodied emotion strong except for therapy-speak "truth's weight pressed upon her" triggering diagnostic label penalty in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation clear by 80 words; Accumulative lens holds with sensory density tightening into Charged Poise closure; cost legible via "burden of silence" crystallizing in final bay return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned bay constrains choices (skeletal ships limit movement) and charges closure via "dawn of awakening" contrast; green shard's emerald glow evolves from tool to emotional anchor across beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth's weight) tightens through brother confrontation; agency-driven escalation culminates in visible cost ("burden of silence" warping her life), but secondary moral calculus underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory mapping metaphor, but brother's "unspoken regret" articulation creates thematic echo; final image reweights "dream-chasing" with earned complexity yet avoids tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensory map maker" lexicon) persists under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during redirects, though corporate diction ("method of parallel universes") intrudes in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Figurative language density acceptable early but muddles climax ("shadows elongated, air thickened with scent of blooming nightflowers"); paraphrase loop in "cyclically spontaneous" repetitions dulls momentum in third act.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory cartography with multiverse trope; emotional specificity in "bearing family's shame" avoids generic templates, though spaceport setting risks sci-fi cliché without shard's unique constraints.</comment>
