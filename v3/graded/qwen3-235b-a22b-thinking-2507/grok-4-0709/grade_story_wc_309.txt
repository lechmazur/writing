<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction ("fingers numb," weeping at simple flowers), but internal conflict leans slightly summary ("harbored quiet motivation") rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses during pressure. Final choice feels earned through tactile struggle with straps.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: keystone's glow reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("wept... automation had stolen"), under Accumulative lens where sensory density builds to luminance eruption. No causality breaks; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Keystone functions as micro-setting that charges closure (glow in pocket "lingering eternally"), with sensory specificity ("frozen vines bloomed into simple flowers") avoiding white-room syndrome. Frost biting skin during mist walking constrains action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through protagonist agency: unstrapping the keystone narrows options (release luminance or not), with unmistakable cost in emotional vulnerability ("wept for pure joy"). Pressure tightens via Accumulative density toward the chamber's revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (keystone's glow vs. programmed auroras), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("light that would linger eternally") offers resonant answer to "sacred simplicity" without stating moral, reweighting the premise through charged specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brilliant dimness," muted gleams) modulates rhythm under pressure, but slight register drift in "unearth genuine wonder" momentarily jars mage's introspective voice during high-stakes approach to chamber.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with strong verbs ("phase through ice walls"), but paraphrase loop in "brilliant dimness" repetition during climax ("making every movement feel both illuminated and obscured") creates minor scaffold without pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "brilliant dimness" as counterpoint to automation avoids tropes; emotional specificity in underachiever's quiet triumph feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric focus over plot) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
