<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for interspecies respect is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "brazen calm" remains unchallenged despite terminal illness, missing embodied tension in peak moments like wire-wrapping under fatigue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the final glow revealing symbiosis, but cost ("content that his work had unlocked a legacy") softens emotional weight; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Living stone pillars actively constrain choices (copper grooves, sap-flow pulses), charging the final image; "oak branches etched with age-old wisdom" exemplifies purpose-driven specificity that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (legacy vs. mortality) deepen through remodel execution, but six-month timeframe lacks active pressure; fatigue during wire-wrapping shows cost, yet illness never alters tactics beyond pacing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through actions (oaks "leaning toward pillars"), not moralizing; final image reweights "brazen calm" as earned wisdom, but "urging harmony in a world often blind" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bark etched with age-old wisdom") shines, but "brazen calm" repetition (4x) creates uniform stress response; lyrical compression serves Accumulative lens without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "methodically, he wrapped... twisting it in spirals" dilutes propulsion; "veins in living stone" contains biological inaccuracy (veins don’t spiral), slightly muddling closure’s physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological sentience via architectural mechanics feels inevitable; "copper wire mimicking stone veins" transforms trope through specific, tactile causality that charges the legacy theme.</comment>
