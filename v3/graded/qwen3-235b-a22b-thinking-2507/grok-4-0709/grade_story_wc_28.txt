<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via retrocognitive traps vs present action, but peak-beat "aberrant mercy" label risks therapy-speak; embodied cost during renaming ritual lacks specific physicality beyond "chanted softly."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tessera alignment deepens pattern density toward Charged Poise closure where automaton's hesitation crystallizes cost. Minor retrocognitive vision feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone constrains choice (chip code alignment) and charges final image ("steps that echoed both warmth and steel"); shattered sky's "icy bite" directly pressures Elias' physical state during ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias' agency aligning tessera with chips, narrowing options to one renaming attempt. Cost legible in automaton's "shuddered" state and "newfound hesitation," though retrocognitive trap slightly softens escalation pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Final image ("seed of change... bridge between past mercies and future hopes") offers resonant CR without moralizing, though "aberrant mercy" phrasing flirts with thematic echo in interiority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("irregularities like braille from the past") and rhythmic control during pressure beats; retrocognitive flashes taught early as patterned elision paying off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("warm coldness" repeated verbatim near closure); otherwise high density with concrete propulsion. "Cradle empathy in arms of steel" recurrence lacks sufficient variation for peak-beat impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "aberrant mercy" within machine empathy premise; "warm coldness" tone transforms familiar post-apocalyptic tropes through specific physical manifestations in closure image.</comment>
