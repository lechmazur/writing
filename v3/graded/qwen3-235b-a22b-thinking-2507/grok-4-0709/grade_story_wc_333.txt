<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation (freeing Mira's idea) drives action, but "unassumingly bold" remains label-only; embodied emotion strong in hair-clutching during disorientation yet "improbable longing" leans thematic. Contradictory impulses (fear/hope) lack simultaneous scene tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: hair-offering crystallizes options with felt cost (Elias's tears, Mira's essence-only return). Accumulative lens holds, but star-vision's disorientation lacks causal pressure buildup; cost proof solid via "fear is gone" voice and stabilized swirl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Nexus setting charges final image: stone arches become light-weaving site, starlight pools as liquid silver. Hair ribbon functions as micro-setting—constrains choice (anchor during disorientation) and charges closure (untying enables portal). Sensory specificity avoids white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing trapped idea) tighten via disorientation sequence, narrowing options to courage-as-key. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, but cost (soul rift mending) remains conceptual; "improbable longing" surge lacks tangible trade-off despite emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hair-ribbon's transformation: fear's cocoon becomes bridge. Final portal image reweights "enveloped secrets" without moralizing, but "improbable longing" phrasing risks thematic echo; earned through Elias's physical act, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone arches twisted like frozen lightning") persists under stress. Voice modulates rhythm during disorientation ("world tilted; shadows danced unnaturally"). No POV leakage; compression of cosmic rules taught early via lore/hint mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "ribbon unraveling slightly in trembling fingers" shows over tells. Figurative language sparse in high-pressure beats (disorientation sequence), but "cosmic possibility" risks abstraction. Final line's "tears mingled with the hush" achieves textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "locksmith" trope via cosmic stakes—tools become courage, locks become fear-cocoons. Fresh synthesis: hair as key reconfigures love/loss into bridge-building. Avoids abstraction through tactile nexus details, though "eternal starlight" borders on generic.</comment>
