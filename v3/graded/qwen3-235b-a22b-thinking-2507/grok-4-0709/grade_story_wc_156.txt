<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but epiphany lacks struggle; "thrilling vertigo of wonder" risks diagnostic label penalty. Visitor remains pure device with no secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but nested awakenings repeat without deepening stakes. One distinct non-closure issue (repetitive escalation) triggers -0.8 deduction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices (e.g., nickel reflection mechanics); final image charged by "hobo nickel still clutched." Micro-setting gate satisfied for 9-band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake clear but pressure fails to intensify—awakenings feel identical without narrowing options. Missing required meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("magic that questions create"), but nested awakenings concept isn't integrated with curiosity trade-off. No thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("methodically playful" cadence) holds under pressure. Minor register drift in "thrilling vertigo of wonder" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density overall but "methodically playful" repeats 3x with paraphrase loops. No closure-impacting artifacts, but filter-verb stacks prevent 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sound physics transforms garden trope, but nested awakenings during pause feels derivative of Inception. Bold risk in lyric structure elevates within band.</comment>
