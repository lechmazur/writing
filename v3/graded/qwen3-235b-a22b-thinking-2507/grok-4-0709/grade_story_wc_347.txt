<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's "reluctant heart swelling with raw satisfaction" during action, but "reluctance burned like slow fire" edges toward abstract label-speak, slightly diluting embodied conflict at the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: pilgrims escape as nut crumbles and frost crystallizes, with cost legible in "weight of her duty a beautiful burden." Causal lens holds from blueprint recall to beacon assembly without ellipsis breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard's thorns and frost directly constrain choices—she must act before crystalline veil forms—and charge the final image where "first frost crystals sparkle" as pilgrims emerge, proving environment as active pressure rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as frost approaches, but Elara's internal conflict (escape vs duty) lacks sufficient friction during the beacon assembly; her reluctant motivation isn't tested by a meaningful trade-off beyond the initial setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "graceless beauty" motif reweighted in the final line—no moralizing, just the visceral cost of duty crystallized in her "awkward and profound" burden as pilgrims flee her entrapment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mossy earth clung like desperate lover") reflects Elara's caretaker lens, but "reluctance burned like slow fire" momentarily slips into abstract phrasing during high pressure, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "ethereal flowers that wilted into thorns by dusk" risks redundant description; figurative language remains clear yet slightly dense in one high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding overwriting penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mechanical birds transform trope through specific logic (razor wings glinting, sensors fooled by wind impressions), and "leaving impressions without touching" synthesizes fresh magic system with tangible stakes—bold risk heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
