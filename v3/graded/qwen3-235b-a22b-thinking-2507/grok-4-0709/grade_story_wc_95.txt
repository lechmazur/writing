<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "dignified chaos" vs inner turmoil, but contact lacks depth; micro-choices like tracing sundial edges reveal values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: waiting→contact→duel forms clean because/therefore chain; Earned Stasis closure lands with visceral cost in rapier skittering into brook.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brook’s murmur actively constrains duel choreography (drowning clashing blades), and sundial’s coded angles charge final image—environment shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening crystallizes when code demonstration triggers rival’s attack; cost is undeniable as disarmed rapier vanishes into brook during map exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final line "journeys yet to unfold" resonates as non-literal answer to "questions as uncharted maps" without moralizing; theme emerges purely through needle-card-to-maps transaction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sunlight fractured into rainbows" and "dignified chaos" modulates under pressure; minor ornateness in opening slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "dignified chaos" repetition creates subtle scaffold; mixed metaphor "storm of thoughts restrained by scholarly poise" slightly muddles peak tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dueling philosophy with tangible mechanics (sundial angles → musical code); swapping needle card for generic artifact would break causal logic entirely.</comment>
