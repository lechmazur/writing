<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "scattered" trait resolved magically without struggle, missing visible cost beyond trembling hands during renewal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with true dawn manifestation, but cost remains abstract ("trembling hands" insufficient); accumulative lens holds though escalation lacks density shifts in high-pressure ritual beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical fruits constrain choice by requiring swaddling; mica window's inverted sunrises charge the final image as they transform to pure light, perfectly fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; realm's weakening occurs passively, with renewal emerging from song without meaningful trade-offs or narrowed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through woven dawns motif charging the final image, but lacks complexity; no counter-readings as renewal succeeds perfectly without moral ambiguity or irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shards like shattered glass" observations; rhythmic control falters during ritual climax where uniform lyrical cadence dulls pressure despite controlled diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Severe overwriting in climax ("golden strands born of reflected sunrises looped through swaddled fruits") creates figurative muddle; synonym loops ("ethereal beings drifting apart like unraveling yarn") reduce propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "woven dawns" concept through alchemical orchard logic; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes but safety-hedging avoids genuine loss (realm fully restored).</comment>
