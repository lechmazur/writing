<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (generosity vs destitution) and embodied emotion during rockslide rescue stand out, but "texture of transformation" phrasing veers into diagnostic label-speak violating POV lexicon under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with felt cost ("gritty shift from loss to renewal"), but prophecy resolution via coincidence violates "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule, weakening causal escalation at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand beach functions as micro-setting: bugs illuminating runes directly calms volcano, charging the final image with environmental constraint shaping outcome—clear 9+ gate fulfillment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Detour creates meaningful tightening by foreclosing safe path (fissure swallows original route), but volcanic eruption threat resolved off-page via bugs' light weakens tangible cost escalation under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (bottled bugs → communal hope), with final image reweighting "transformation" as "vibrant hush" without moralizing—avoids thematic echo despite near-miss with "texture" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ashen soil," "celestial ballet") and rhythmic control under pressure excel, but elevated diction ("languid waltz") during high-stakes rockslide scene disrupts POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until final paragraph where "vibrant hush" repetition crosses into synonym churn; minor density issues in pressure beats (e.g., "vibrant yet subdued" redundancy) prevent 8.2+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through accidental fulfillment via specific volcanic logic; emotional truth in destitution-as-fuel avoids generic templates, though "bottled light" archetype lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
