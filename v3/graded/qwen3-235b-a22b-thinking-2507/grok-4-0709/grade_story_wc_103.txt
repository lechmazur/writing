<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("texture of time") and earned endurance with cost ("fading echoes"), but lacks contradictory impulses during the trap—Elias reacts without internal struggle between obsession and self-preservation. "Quaking reverie" repeats without deepening tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with visible cost (fragment's loss), but hyperbolic solution lacks escalation—disintegration feels convenient without prior setup. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost undercuts emotional weight via "smiled faintly" too soon after trauma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Living bridge garden constrains choices (vines anchor him) and supplies escape resources (hyperbolic geometry inspiration). Final image of "trembling threads of existence" recharges prior motifs with undeniable pressure—environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulating visions (fading lovers' initials, prehistoric blooms disintegrating), but Elias's agency in resolution lacks sufficient complication—the halo fragment's origin remains purely external without deepening moral calculus. Cost (irretrievable echoes) is legible yet slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: time as "rough and knotted, like bark," resolved by final "sand slipping through an hourglass." Avoids moralizing; "gritty yet ephemeral" insight earned via struggle. Final image reweights time's texture without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows quivered like forgotten dreams," "sepia ghosts") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor tic: "reverie" repeats 3x with diminishing returns, risking voice convergence during peak tension. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances density ("threads unraveling like overexposed film"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle; rhythm varies naturally (short bursts during panic). "Retrocognitively trapped" slightly jargon-y but context-justified.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope via hyperbolic geometry lens—specific details (angelic halo, living hedges) avoid cliché. Emotional truth in obsession/loss balance; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with conceptual integrity. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
