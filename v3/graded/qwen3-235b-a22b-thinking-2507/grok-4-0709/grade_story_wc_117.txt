<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines via micro-choices (adapting melodies to Finn's silence), but Elara's emotional calibration lacks irrationality under stress; flawless therapeutic precision feels unrealized in crisis moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Finn's tearful touch of the hair curl during eclipse reconfigures "ordinary magic" with felt cost (sun's return mirroring fragile hope), under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sage ridge functions as micro-setting: dreaming roots form a cradle for pivotal scenes, constraining physical/emotional choices; the locket's tangible weight charges the eclipse climax with specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via eclipse's cadence shift, but Finn's apathy-to-wonder arc lacks visible price paid; the cost (renewed vulnerability) feels conceptual rather than dramatized in tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through raindrop/dance metaphors, but "sun's return, resilient and bright, much like hope" edges toward sentimentality, diluting earned complexity in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sage bloomed thickest," roots "humming with anticipation") filters all description through Elara's therapeutic lens; rhythm modulates perfectly from hushed roots to eclipse awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold, but "cautious exuberance" label in peak beats triggers minor therapy-speak penalty; otherwise, lyrical density serves momentum without muddying closure's corona-lit locket moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms therapy tropes through specific, tactile magic (hair curl, singing sage); avoids sentimentality via Finn's grounded skepticism, though "ordinary magic" concept lacks fresh moral calculus.</comment>
