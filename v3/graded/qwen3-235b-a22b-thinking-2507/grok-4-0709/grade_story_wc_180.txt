<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-fueled motivation and embodied contradictions (defiant yet vulnerable) drive choices under pressure; Lila’s reactive role limits relationship crucible depth despite the ribbon’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the fused ribbon crystallizes generational renewal through accidental spillage, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens via density shift in the notebook’s fall.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard constrains every choice (slippery bark, height-induced peril) and charges the final image—quartz-infused ribbon—proving environment-as-setting necessity for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation hinges on Elias’s agency: the bag’s accidental spill tightens options (dangling → securing branch), making the notebook’s thematic revelation feel earned under Accumulative pressure with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars—the deciduous vows reframed by falling notebook pages—avoiding moralizing; the final ribbon fusion offers a resonant, non-literal answer to impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (quartz eyes revealing "ephemeral vows") and rhythmic control under duress; Elias’s feisty dialogue ("Bah! Wisdom doesn’t come from safe perches!") carries subtext without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "grief-fogged mind" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, zero loops and high density—though "rustled trowel" typo risks artifact penalty without closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mending quartz eyes with orchard cathedral transforms tropes; emotional specificity in generational loss avoids sentimentality while risking poetic density without obfuscation.</comment>
