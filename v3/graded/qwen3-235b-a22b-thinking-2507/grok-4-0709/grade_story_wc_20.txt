<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "luminous regret" vs redemption drive, embodied through coin-clutching and whispering elements. Micro-choices like using Virgo alignment reveal hierarchy of values. Slight backstory block overreach risks BRR limits but anchors in present via coin handling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: regret softening to acceptance as the foundry "gilded and whole." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds through zodiac invocations until the coalesced figure reconfigures meaning. Backstory reflection stays anchored to present action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The foundry functions as micro-setting: rain residue evaporating during climax, dust supplying "conceptual shards," anvil constraining the coin's placement. Final image ("equilibrium reigned, gilded and whole") charges closure through environmental evolution, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when invoking full zodiac cycle makes the foundry "tremble," narrowing options to a single crystallized stance. Protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in "luminous regret" transforming to acceptance without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: kintsugi as "golden seams" reweights "fractures of the soul" without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal resolution—"equilibrium reigned, gilded and whole"—recharging the porcelain metaphor with earned complexity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soot-streaked walls," "regret-tinged glow") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "factually mystical" lexicon stays plausible for alchemist POV. Zero dialogue avoids voice contamination risks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("Sweat beaded... melting gold infused with stardust"), but "luminous regret" repetition creates subtle synonym churn in peak beats. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet minor scaffold in reflective passages prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" transforms alchemy tropes through specific kintsugi integration; emotional truth avoids cliché. Fresh synthesis of scientific precision and mystical weight feels inevitable, though not radically risk-taking beyond genre conventions.</comment>
