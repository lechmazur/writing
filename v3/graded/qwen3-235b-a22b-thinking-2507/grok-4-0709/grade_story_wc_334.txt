<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "curiosity tempered into safe academia" vs. resurgent pull; embodied cost clear when memories flood back with "blurred edges." Micro-choice to press mushroom with "crisp nostalgia" reveals hierarchy of values over greed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: her emergence "whole again" forecloses academic life with felt cost of decades lost. Causal lens holds—studying constellations directly enables memory recovery, no coincidence. Cost proof in sediment "swirling like forgotten dreams."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shipwrecks function as micro-setting that constrains choice: their "broken constellations" become navigational tool. Final ascent charges closure with "shipwrecks whispering farewells," reweighting setting from threat to witness. Apple orchard’s "crisp" recurrence charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: observing light diffraction narrows options to pressing Orion-aligned mushroom. Visible cost in fragmented memories ("laughter... blurred at edges") alters tactics—she avoids blind touch. Agency drives every tightening; no coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "crisp nostalgia" reprise: final ascent under "true starry sky" reweights "real treasure" as self-recovery. Avoids moralizing by embedding insight in action ("ready for whatever curiosity beckoned next").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: academic precision in "diffracted off jagged metal" shifts to lyrical urgency underwater. Rhythmic control peaks in closure—"shipwrecks whispering farewells" compresses emotion without ventriloquism. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "sediment swirled like forgotten dreams" integrates setting with interiority. Figurative language sparse but potent ("nostalgia hit like fresh breeze"). Final line’s "crisp nostalgia" avoids echo by charging motif with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shipwrecks as "broken constellations" transforms fairy lore tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes—methodical approach replaces reckless touch—without gimmickry. Emotional truth in "habits formed around voids" avoids generic recovery arcs.</comment>
