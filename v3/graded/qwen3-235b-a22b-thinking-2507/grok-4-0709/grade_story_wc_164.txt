<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cheerful gloom" embodiment and clutching crater glass while smiling faintly; final conjecture earns bittersweet resolution with visible cost ("gentle ache of what remains unseen"). Diagnostic label "cheerful gloom" risks therapy-speak but is character-named and consistently embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("joy with the gentle ache") under Accumulative lens; "geode's glow seemed brighter" reconfigures meaning through prior particulars. Orientation clear by 50 words; cost proof solid in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cave refracts light to shape transliteration process ("living kaleidoscope that felt like stepping inside a dream"), constraining how emotions manifest; crater glass charges final image with "luminous stories that danced forever on cave walls". Micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via conjecture-driven deepening: "farewell's echo" seed to sailor's voyage, narrowing options to acceptance of natural drift; cost ("gentle ache") unmistakable in closure image. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens flawless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights "missing pieces" as preserved luminous stories—a resonant non-literal answer avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges through "seeds that fail to take root" metaphor, with complexity in embracing inevitable loss without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "foam bubbles popping before they could form lasting memories"; rhythmic control under pressure via refrains like "cheerful gloom" taught early. No head-hopping; elision in bird backstory pays off in conjecture mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pollen-dusted memories of waves crashing" achieves triple density. Final line crystallizes theme without muddle: "joy with the gentle ache of what remains unseen" avoids figurative clutter in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Sea-foam recollectionist" transforms memory trope through foam's fragility; "cheerful gloom" tone synthesizes joy/sorrow organically. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, avoiding derivative middle-ground choices.</comment>
