<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract with stock emotional shorthand ("mulberry ache," "deep purple sorrow"); contradictory impulses lack embodied friction in pivotal moments despite clear motivation. Coffee ritual shows micro-choice but resolution feels rationalized rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: final image crystallizes reconfigured stakes ("dream nestled in the gaps") with felt cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Perforation motif density reweights empire/dream binary, though amulet's urgency lacks tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (coffee grounds enabling propagation) constrains climax and charges final image, but early velvet/observatory descriptions remain atmospheric rather than pressuring choices until late. Greenhouse annex crucially supplies resources for resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by textural deepening (fern whispers intensifying, amulet dimming) under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual ("mulberry ache softening") without visible sacrifice altering tactics. Empire/dream stakes dramatized yet resolution avoids concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through perforation motif reweighting binary into integration; final "hidden garden" image offers resonant answer without moralizing. Near-miss on thematic echo ("mend the tears in destiny") saved by being fern's plea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velvety musk," "bruised fruit" similes) and rhythmic control under pressure, though "mulberry ache" repetition dulls later beats. Telepathic plant voices taught early and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("mulberry ache" x4) and slight overwriting in climax ("propagating perforated destinies") reduce density, but no closure damage. Strong textural specificity elsewhere; coffee grounds transition from ritual to literal soil component.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of provenance research with destiny-perforation concept, but coffee-stain method feels ornamental rather than transformative. Resolution lacks bold risk-taking—integration feels too neat for declared stakes despite strong fern-propagation execution.</comment>
