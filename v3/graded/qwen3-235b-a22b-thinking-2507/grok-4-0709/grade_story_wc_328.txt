<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (bitterness vs cosmic joke) shown through phone confession, but emotional shift to "ironic joy" lacks embodied cost; brother's loss mentioned but not viscerally charged in transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (humanity forfeited), but "bitterness ebbed" abstracts emotional price; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via harmony motif, though cost legibility weakens final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and arrowhead's warmth constrain choice (dialing runes); final image of floating upward with embedded arrowhead charges closure through recurring object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via arrowhead's escalating gravity (soil particles orbiting), narrowing options to metamorphosis; but "cosmic joke" motivation lacks tangible trade-offs during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "untamed harmony" reweighted by final image (vines sprouting in mid-air), avoiding moralizing; yet "laughter at fate's absurdity" edges toward thematic echo in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frostbitten hope," "starlit secrets") modulates under stress; free indirect style cleanly conveys Elara's shifting psyche without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("gravitationally playful tug" compresses physics/emotion), but "frostbitten yet hopeful" is stock phrasing in high-pressure beat, dulling transformation cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes cryptid tropes through "gravitationally playful" specificity; risk-taking (phone confessions triggering change) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
