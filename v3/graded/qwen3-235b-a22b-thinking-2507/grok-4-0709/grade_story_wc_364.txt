<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "bartering silence" is label not embodied cost. Motivation clear but final choice lacks visible trade-off under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost, but causal links thin—"because" logic missing in ritual success. Lens (Accumulative) holds yet inconsistently applied to escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid setting but micro-setting fails: silk/hammer/rubble don't constrain choices. Final image lacks charge from prior object handling despite lyrical descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes clear yet pressure never tightens; ritual proceeds linearly without complication. Cost ("meek silence") feels tacked on rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through rubble-to-hope transformation. Final image reweights "bartered awakenings" without moralizing, though lacks counter-readings for deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hammer strikes soft as whispers") with rhythmic control. Minor therapy-speak ("bartering silence") slightly mars peak-beat authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm shifts, but "defiant" repetition creates subtle scaffold. Final image remains sharp despite minor overwriting in ritual description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "orchard planet" and stone guardians elevates tropes. Risk in abstract magic system pays off through concrete emotional specificity in closure.</comment>
