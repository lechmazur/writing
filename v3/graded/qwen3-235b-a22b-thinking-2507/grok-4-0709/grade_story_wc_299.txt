<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "confidently uncertain" posture and embodied grief, but "insulating emotionally with facts" slips into diagnostic label-speak during cloth discovery, undermining emotional authenticity at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: pocketing the cloth crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("valley of what-ifs" now charged with purpose), though the quarry's physical vastness slightly overshadows the felt cost of risking financial stability for meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust motes, speaker cloth, and quarry pits function as micro-setting that charges the final image—texture of the cloth in Jack's pocket reweights the "echo valley longing" from emptiness to resonance, perfectly meeting 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation of sensory pressure (dust, echoes, fabric texture), but the cloth's discovery relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency, limiting escalation depth despite strong cost legibility in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"After the applause" evolves from theme to actionable purpose via the cloth—final image ("faint, longing hum of purpose reborn") resonates non-literally without moralizing, though the band's backstory slightly over-explains the thematic pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tarnished silverware," "starlit scars") and rhythmic control under pressure elevate voice, but "insulating emotionally with facts" recurs as unmodulated filter phrasing during emotional peak, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with concrete specificity ("frayed—scrap of speaker grille cloth, black mesh dotted with tiny tears like starlit scars"), but "insulating emotionally with facts" appears twice as therapy-speak scaffold, muddying the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms rock-memorabilia trope through tactile specificity (nylon weave, custom tear pattern) and emotional authenticity, though the "undervalued vase" backstory leans on familiar failure clichés without fresh inflection.</comment>
