<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "resiliently positive" trait remains untested under pressure with no visible struggle against despair during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ethereal sand, woven memories), but cost proof is vague; "memories of alternate lives" lacks specific on-page sacrifice despite valid Situational lens hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spectral grotto functions as micro-setting that charges closure (glowing stalactites illuminate hourglass patterns), with recurring hourglass constraining Elias' tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elias' radio/hourglass actions under Situational lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss alters tactics despite dominant "vanishing" stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("he understood the tone... permanent transient") triggers -0.7 penalty; theme stated outright undermines earned resonance through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waves and wandering souls," "clocks run sideways") persists under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in grotto imagery without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "rummaging... relic from bygone era" but zero loops; high density in climax ("pulses resonated... bridges of light") with clear propulsion despite slight purple prose in "frozen comets."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal rift tropes via "permanent transient" lens; risk-taking in merging timelines through radio/hourglass feels inevitable through prior grotto patterning.</comment>
