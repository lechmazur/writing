<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (dream vs. duty) embodied in trembling hands and tearful release; micro-choice to touch crystal reveals hierarchy of values. Told backstory about family needs slightly weakens causality but closure choice to endure feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: bearing regret forecloses musical path with visible cost in tears and shifted scent perception. "Excruciatingly gentle" repetition slightly muddies final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (triggers memories) and charges final image (petrichor evolving from ache to renewal). Glacial hush described but doesn't actively narrow options, missing constraint requirement for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Internal stake (accepting abandoned dream) tightens through crystal whispers' intensifying pressure, narrowing options to endurance. Cost unmistakable in tears and weight-bearing, though escalation is subtle rather than sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: petrichor scent's transformation reweights "abandoned dream" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer through rose-gold crystals and renewed scent, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sound-focused introvert noticing vibrations, not voices) with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. "Excruciatingly gentle" repetition slightly disrupts voice consistency in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat with high density, but "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times—repetitive phrasing near ending triggers -0.3 penalty despite vivid textural specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned dream" trope through clock/music duality and crystal mechanics. Risk in quiet resolution pays off: petrichor's reweighted meaning feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding sentimental safety.</comment>
