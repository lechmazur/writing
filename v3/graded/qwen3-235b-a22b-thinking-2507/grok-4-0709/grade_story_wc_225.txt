<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "fierce repose" masking inner storm; decoding threads forces embodied admissions of arrogance without therapy-speak. Final forgiveness earned by prior unraveling with visceral cost ("weight lift from chest").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: tapestry's crack and villagers resuming motion crystallize Elias's self-forgiveness with undeniable conceptual cost (years of exile). Accumulative lens holds via thunder-lull rhythm tightening pressure toward unraveling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth constrains every choice—fidgeting sharpens decoding focus, its realignment charges absolution. Tapestry's frayed border isn't backdrop but active decoder ring; time-frozen air's "unspoken regrets" mirror Elias's guilt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's decoding agency: each thread unraveled narrows emotional options toward acceptance. Thunder-lull rhythm creates live clock pressure; cost crystallizes when "past mistake no longer a chain but a lesson," altering his future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from thread-decoding as guilt-unraveling, not moralizing. Final image—"productive fidgets now guiding others"—resonantly reweights platinum labyrinth from downfall symbol to teaching tool without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: chess metaphors ("moves on chessboard") and tactile thread focus filter all description. Rhythm shifts from staccato decoding ("Thread by thread") to flowing resolution, compressing stress without voice break.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fidgeted productively" appears four times as motif-driven escalation, not redundancy. Sentences vary rhythm to mirror tension—short during decoding, lyrical at closure ("time stirring like a sleeper awakening"). No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess tutor decodes time-curse via thread patterns, transforming "woven hush" from cliché into tactile mechanism. Emotional specificity avoids redemption tropes; platinum's shift from "knot of self-blame" to "lesson" feels inevitable.</comment>
