<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "silence as possibility" lands via embodied micro-choices (tracing fragment's edge, tentative hum), but the pivotal singing shift lacks visible struggle—cost feels conceptual rather than visceral despite strong trait integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density escalation (recurring "misting hush," wind bells' chime), but cost proof falters: the "forever altered" silence lacks tangible sacrifice; the fragment's warmth catalyzes change without measurable trade-off in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice—bioluminescent fungi illuminate the fragment, vines choke wheels forcing interior exploration—and charges the final image (halo light spilling over oasis), with sensory details filtered through Elias's tactile carpenter perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via sensory accumulation (silence as canvas), but escalation lacks agency-driven pressure; the halo fragment's warmth resolves internal conflict too neatly without Elias overcoming resistance, muting the cost of breaking silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "quietly persistent" carving to singing, with final image reweighting silence as generative—but "interpret silence as possibility" edges toward thematic echo, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (wood-grain focus, sound-centric noticing), and rhythmic control intensifies under pressure (chime-hum fusion), though "whispering gleam" repetition slightly dilutes the lyrical payoff in peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure, but adjacent synonym loops ("misting hush"/"soft veil of quiet") and elevated diction ("improbably thriving") in mid-beats dilute momentum; final line's propulsion compensates for minor density issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-creativity within circus decay avoids tropes, yet the halo fragment's celestial trope slightly undercuts specificity; risk-taking in Accumulative structure elevates but doesn't transcend familiar magical realism beats.</comment>
