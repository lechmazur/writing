<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fierce tenderness burning"/"cryptic facade") drives action, but emotional progression lacks sufficient irrationality; the epiphany feels earned yet slightly over-articulated in "I loved you fiercely, tenderly" without deeper self-deception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "stepped out, ready to decide anew" crystallizes stance with visible cost ("scars," "wounds stirring"), though the Accumulative lens risks thin escalation; the single deepening (tracing messages) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard (tool) constrains choice (blood ritual) and charges the final image ("fierce tenderness remained"); mangroves/spirits function as micro-setting, with roots shifting to mirror emotional shifts without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (reclaiming unsaid apologies) tighten through Elara’s agency—tracing messages narrows options from reflection to action—but the cost ("mending fractures of regret") feels emotionally resolved too neatly, slightly dulling the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fierce tenderness" evolves from defensive crypticness to active resolve, with the final image ("ready to decide anew") offering non-literal answer to vulnerability without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veils between worlds," "singing spirits") modulates with intensity; rhythmic control under pressure ("roots shifting," "spirits circling") sustains Accumulative lens, though "cryptic medium" label slightly flattens voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density in peak beats risks overwriting ("grooves that once channeled storms from cathedral eaves"), but cadence shifts (short sentences during blood ritual) propel momentum; minor scaffold in "fragile limbo before a choice hardened into fate" deducts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove labyrinth as emotional landscape transforms "unsent letters" trope; specificity ("brackish water," "condensation like breath on glass") grounds universality, though "singing spirits" border on familiar.</comment>
