<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between blithe nature and "deeper pull" is concrete but emotional embodiment stays abstract ("heart aching softly"); final choice earned yet lacks visceral trade-off cost despite strong micro-choices during decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with cost ("echoes crescendoed, then faded into peaceful silence") under Accumulative lens; minor retroactive patch when spectral voices explain lovers' backstory slightly undermines pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt silo and tapestry function as micro-setting charging final image (dawn piercing stars), but environment never constrains action; atmospheric density compensates though sensory selection remains POV-coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias' decoding agency with rising density ("crimson thread looped into 'E'"), but the emotional cost of absorbed echoes feels implied rather than viscerally dramatized in the closure beat despite coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image of case on forget-me-not grave reweights "untangling threads" as non-literal answer to hidden intentions without moralizing; lovers' redemption avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars of sovereign case and frayed tapestry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in gardening lexicon ("loamy soil," "velvet cloth") and rhythmic control during decoding, but "velveteen gloom" overuse edges toward voice drift in early high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Figurative overload in opening ("cobalt silo loomed like a forgotten sentinel," "laughter a soft ripple") risks density penalty; clean closure image saves momentum but adjacent synonym loops ("tenderly organized," "lovingly remembered") trigger minor scaffold deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess/gardening metaphors for intentionality avoids tropes; "sovereign case as echo vessel" transforms familiar objects with specific stakes, though velveteen gloom risks near-echo of atmospheric clichés without full transformation.</comment>
