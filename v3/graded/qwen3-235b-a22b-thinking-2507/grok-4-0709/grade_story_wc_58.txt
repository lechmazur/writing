<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses in scene; motivation told not shown through micro-choices. Solitude cost felt but not earned by prior causality, missing Q1 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("wiser in his solitude"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation clear by line 3 without penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Palace thread functions as micro-setting charging closure; garden atmosphere supports but doesn't constrain choices, missing full 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via sensory deepening (thread warming/cooling); cost unmistakable in solitude. Agency through endurance fits Accumulative lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final rose image reweights "explained absences" without moralizing. Theme emerges through ritual, avoiding thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lonesome splendor," "veins of forgotten glory") modulates rhythm under pressure. Zero POV leaks in lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; density serves propulsion ("golden flecks seeming to unravel"). Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Obituaries for the living" transforms trope through specific healing geography. Emotional truth in solitude-as-triumph avoids generic templates.</comment>
