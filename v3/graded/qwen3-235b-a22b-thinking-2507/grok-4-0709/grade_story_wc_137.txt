<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (skepticism vs kindness driving action) but "guilt for not believing in miracles sooner" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, violating rubric's -0.4 to -0.6 prohibition for abstract emotional labeling during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens succeeds with emotional reconfiguration, but cost proof fails: no concrete on-page image shows legible cost (e.g., "burdensome tangle" is abstract; Kai's absence remains implied not dramatized).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the magic square tile functions as essential tool charging the final image ("warm in her pocket"), though the tower itself lacks causal constraint on choices despite vivid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density (whale calls intensifying, tile patterns emerging) perfectly reweights the dominant stake under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility suffers—permanent loss is felt yet lacks unmistakable on-page manifestation in closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (transcribing memories via tile) and resonant final image ("sculpted space for reflection"), avoiding all moralizing traps; the ending reweights the opening motivation without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mathematical curiosity," "unheard symphony") modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, but stress compression fails during peak memory transcribing—syntax remains uniformly lyrical rather than shortening under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density, but paraphrase loop ("sculpt space for reflection"/"carving out a quiet haven") triggers -0.2 deduction; "unbreakable sibling love" slightly stock phrasing adds minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical magic square with whale migration as emotional mirror transforms tropes; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes coherently without obscuring the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
