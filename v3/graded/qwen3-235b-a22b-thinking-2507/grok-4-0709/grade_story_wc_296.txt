<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when her guardedness strains yet she holds serenity, but "warlike serenity" label edges toward stock phrasing; transformation earned as barriers unbend during the seed's growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost ("serenity deepened by victory's quiet toll"); Accumulative escalation through three circles tightens pressure flawlessly under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cursed lake's vortex actively pressures choices (dodging lashing trees), while the flesh-eating seed functions as micro-setting object that constrains the climax and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "frozen confession" literalizes buried truths, with final line reweighting the premise through "catalyst for truths long lost" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("staff tracing circles like ripples") shows rhythmic control under pressure; "blade at rest" simile slightly generic but voice remains coherent through crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density falters in "trees lashing like living catapults" (spatial clash with prior spirals); minor scaffold in "guarded nature began to strain... but held serenity" dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "expanding circles" method transforms druid tropes, while "unbending" as dual physical/emotional action feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
