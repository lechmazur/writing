<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s restlessness and Marek’s hidden tenderness manifest through embodied micro-choices (scrimshaw passed twice, jaw traced) under pressure, avoiding therapy-speak. Final transformation earned by scrimshaw-triggered lineage memories, though Marek’s depth slightly thin for 800 words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "leaving only ripples" and Marek holding etched scrimshaw. Accumulative lens holds—whale call’s resonance tightens options through scrimshaw’s evolving role, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe pressures choices (water "lapping like an invitation," transformation in waves); scrimshaw functions as micro-setting constraining tactics and charging the final image (now "etched with her story"). No generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: scrimshaw unlocks deepen emotional stakes, whale call forces the island’s appearance. Cost legible in Marek’s silhouette and "fighting the emptiness," reweighting freedom’s price under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scrimshaw’s transformation—from ancestral relic to etched legacy—and Elara’s shift from "prison" peace to "wild peace." Final image reweights freedom without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "phantom land" reality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile focus ("scrimshaw warmed," "water lapping at ankles") modulates with intensity. Dialogue’s "combative tenderness" carries subtext via action (grabbing arm with affection), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("fists unclenched into open palms") advances atmosphere without muddle. Final line’s "unlocking hope" resonates without overwriting. Peak beats (transformation) sustain propulsion through strong verbs ("shifting," "faded").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: enforced peace as prison reframes merfolk tropes via scrimshaw’s lineage reveal. Bold risk in quiet physical transformation; specificity ("sublittoral fringe," dock ballet) anchors emotional truth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
