<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in panic versus calm; micro-choices like forced stillness and vial uncorking reveal hierarchy of values. Slight over-tidiness in memory-triggered calm reduces irrationality, but embodied emotion ("gloved fingers trembled") and flaw-driven struggle with instinct override earn high marks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s triumph crystallizes with undeniable cost (impending death) under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by 80 words; pressure escalates via sensory density and oxygen depletion. Cost proof: "time ran short, but she had tamed the ephemeral" makes sacrifice legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temple setting constrains choices (water resistance, spatial isolation) and charges closure’s "majestic isolation." Bioluminescent corals and viscous water reflect urgency; sensory hierarchy shows professional focus on vial. Micro-setting (submersible suit alarms) directly alters tactics during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via oxygen countdown forcing agency: survival versus harnessing transience. Escalation driven by Elara’s choices (uncorking vial, unsnarling hush) under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral—final warnings blare as she seals victory. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (unsnarling hush), not abstraction. Final image reweights "ephemeral" as both captured and fleeting, avoiding moralizing. Slight risk in "splendor of what she had wrought" edges toward sentimentality, but earned through sensory struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "water grew thicker, almost viscous" reflects character-specific stress narrowing. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences for wonder, clipped phrases during panic. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during memory flood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; sentences like "breathing slowly, deliberately, against the tide of fear" advance character and pressure. Minor deduction for "impossible in aqueous realm" logic hiccup, but closure remains sharp. Figurative language sparse in climax, avoiding overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms underwater temple trope through "gathered hush" as tangible pressure. Emotional specificity in balancing panic/calm avoids templates. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes—ephemeral as physical threads to untangle—without gimmickry.</comment>
