<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied phobias ("bones shake," "agoraphobia clawed"), but Mara's motivation lacks depth, and the "vulnerability is power" theme edges toward tell in closure despite strong causal integration of flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("phobias raw but harnessed"); causal lens holds tightly from seashell's guidance to trap activation, though Mara's sudden lunge feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rusted library actively pressures choices (claustrophobia in shelves, acrophobia on shelf), with the seashell constraining tactics during decoding; stars' evolution from "mocking" to "endless" charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally under pressure: Mara's approach forces decoding race, with Elias's phobias creating authentic trade-offs; cost legible in trembling hands and harnessed-but-raw fears during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action (using phobias as tools), not moralizing; final line avoids cliché by tying "vulnerability is power" to the physical act of rewriting his story under stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("iron shelves twisted like forgotten promises") modulates under stress with purposeful compression; rhythmic control during decoding beat ("trembling hands... cryptic symbols") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "betrayal had been transformative" slightly dulls momentum, but prose stays lean and sensorially precise ("cracked and yellowed cast," "disorienting chorus"); no loops in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms stunt-double trope: phobias as tactical tools and childhood cast as cipher device feel inevitable; risk-taking (vulnerability as weapon) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
