<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in Elias's "sensitively perceptive" nature versus scholarly desperation shows in tactile diary handling, but flaws lack visible struggle beyond mild tremors; micro-choices remain observational rather than high-stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (exhausted dreams), but the "stirrings of hope" lacks visceral legibility; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though pressure lacks meaningful deepening beyond discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" setting constrains perception (sound absorption guiding Elias's probe) and charges the final image; silo's steel curves actively store narratives, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring dreams) signaled early, but pressure remains static—no escalation beyond discovery; Elias faces no opposition, reducing tension to passive revelation rather than earned agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tapestry fragment's reweighted meaning at closure ("dragons' eyes gleaming with approval"), avoiding moralizing; "fragile balance" concept resonates via concrete particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bronze quiet," "yellowed like autumn leaves") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in probe sequence ("fingers trembling," "pages fused") teaches pattern early for Charged Poise payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("sensitively perceptive" x2) and elevated diction ("unspoken narratives") in mid-beat; no closure-dulling artifacts, but filter-verb stacks ("he sensed," "he felt") slightly dilute immediacy during discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Displaced axis" transforms apocalypse tropes through specific wall-absorbed narratives; emotional truth in Elias's hope avoids sentimentality, though historian archetype lacks radical reinvention beyond setting.</comment>
