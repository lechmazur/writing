<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (theatricality vs. sincerity) drives micro-choices like whispering to the clasp, but brother's voice revelation lacks embodied cost escalation; "envied your peace" risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient physical consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("tears welling," trembling clasp), but Accumulative lens ambiguity emerges midway when cataloging shifts to recovery without clear pattern teaching; cost proof remains undeniable in "mended an invisible rift."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Workshop functions as micro-setting through the clasp constraining choices, but resonator mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical; final image charged by "velvet-bound tome" yet lacks causal pressure on Elias' actions during tuning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via Elias' agency (tuning higher), but "final stillness before fireworks" time pressure dissipates when fireworks ignite without affecting his process; escalation lacks felt consequence despite emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory particulars ("hush of regret laced with unshed tears"), avoiding moralizing; final forgiveness image reweights the premise with conceptual cost, satisfying Q5 9+ test without a single stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "frost on a blade" descriptions, but peak stress (brother's voice) maintains poetic diction without syntactic compression; "symphony of subtle tones" drifts into elevated register incongruent with Elias' immediate tearful reaction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Template cadence weakens propulsion in "First came... Next, tuning higher..." sequence; "velvet-bound tome" after "frayed velvet" creates synonym churn, but zero closure artifacts preserve momentum in the final forgiveness beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of empathy through acoustic metaphor elevates tropes, but estranged brother dynamic lacks specific transformation beyond universal regret; risk-taking in "cataloging silences" heightens stakes yet avoids revolutionary insight.</comment>
