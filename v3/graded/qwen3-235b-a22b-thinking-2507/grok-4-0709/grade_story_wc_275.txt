<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; pacifism lacks struggle despite father's legacy. "Senselessly perceptive" remains label-only trait without embodied cost in pivotal moments like finding the scrap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands, but cost legibility fails—no on-page sentence crystallizes the price of her choice beyond vague "fading legacy." Orientation anchors are clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dome and roses create vivid atmosphere, but setting doesn't constrain choices; sandstorms howl harmlessly beyond glass, missing micro-setting opportunity to pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative lens, yet escalation lacks visceral cost—father's absence remains backstory, not present forfeiture. "Weaving continuity" motivation tightens but pays no tangible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "engraved quiet" and sheathed trowel; final image reweights chaos with resonant non-literal answer ("continuity threading through every thorn") sans moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via "senselessly perceptive" lens, but rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beats with abstract phrasing like "irrational gift" diluting immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops ("weave continuity") and mixed metaphor "tranquil blaze" slightly muddle peak beats; no artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism via gardening-as-resistance, though dome/farm setting echoes familiar dystopian tropes without transformative specificity.</comment>
