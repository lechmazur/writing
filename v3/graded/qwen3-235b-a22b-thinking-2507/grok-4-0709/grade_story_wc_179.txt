<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thorne's resentment labeled rather than embodied; "festered for decades" lacks contradictory impulses. Elara's scheming pacifism shown concretely but his release lacks visible struggle, weakening earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Thorne's physical release ("convulsed slightly... resentment evaporating") carries felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through vibrational pattern buildup; reality shifts tighten pressure coherently to the pin's vanishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sanctuary functions as micro-setting: gravity tilting during approach, rippling floor at climax directly constrain choices. Pin's reappearance charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via reality shifts (gravity tilt, dissolving walls), but pin resolves resentment it didn't create. Thorne's passive release weakens agency; cost is felt but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "shifting grace" emerges through Thorne's cellular memories of childhood forgiveness. Final image (lighter departure, pin reappearing) offers non-literal answer to resentment's cost without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vibrational POV creates distinct perceptual signature ("whispered through vibrations alone"), but abstract terms ("shifting grace") dilute specificity. Consistent lyrical rhythm modulates effectively from tension to release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "walls dissolving into mist and reforming" integrates action with atmosphere. Minor overwriting ("colors bleeding into new hues") in early beats, but zero loops in closure sequence maintains clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms pacifist trope through soundless constraint and cellular memory mechanics. Pin's reappearance logic feels fresh, avoiding derivative resolution; specificity of "broken music box cylinder pin" elevates beyond generic symbol.</comment>
