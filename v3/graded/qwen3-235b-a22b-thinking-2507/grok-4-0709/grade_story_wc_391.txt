<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses ("restrained wildness" vs. calm vigilance) act simultaneously in scene, especially during the viaduct alignment where her "inner storm" fuels deliberate action. Micro-choices like etching scrolls and aligning keys reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (impatience transformed into enduring strength). Exiles lack individuation, weakening relationship dynamics per scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "frozen lake below reflected the moon's path, a mirror of their quiet triumph" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (tyranny's unraveling begins). Accumulative escalation succeeds through rain-amplified viaduct hum and lunar convergence tightening tactics. Minor BRR violation: backstory reflection ("her people, scattered...") doesn't tilt present stance via micro-choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain choices (isolation enabling observation) while the viaduct's rain-slicked iron-laced stone directly alters tactics (magnetizing keys). Final image charged: "lake reflected the moon's path, a mirror of their quiet triumph" reweights setting's significance. "Glassy tomb" cliché slightly mars specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: rain awakens viaduct → moon paths converge → signals pulse out, tightening the dominant stake (sculpting patience from impatience). Cost unmistakable in "impatience transformed into enduring strength" with conceptual price (tyranny's first threads unyoking). One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: moon-path mapping as "patient revolution" strategy. Final image ("whispers of unyoking spread, softly purposeful") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Near-failure: early "patient revolution" statement risks abstraction but redeemed by visceral execution at viaduct.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "vigilant horizon mapper" notices "subtle distortions," "luminous trails," and magnetic hum. Rhythmic control under pressure ("steps deliberate yet charged with inner storm") avoids syntactic monotony. Minor abstraction in "raw fury alone would shatter them" slightly disrupts POV lexicon during high stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops with high density: "magnetic viaduct, a crumbling arch of iron-laced stone spanning a ravine" compresses worldbuilding and action prep. Final beat ("signals pulsed out, invisible waves") maintains clarity. "Restrained wildness" repetition (3x) near-synonym churn in peak beats costs 0.1 despite motif service.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial mapping as encoded revolution strategy transforms rebellion tropes. Emotional truth in impatience-as-"chain" metaphor. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens for revolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Lacks the "indispensable" insight for 9.0 band despite strong cohesion.</comment>
