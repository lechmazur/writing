<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "shadow of doubt" is diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. Motivation clear but final choice lacks visible tradeoffs beyond abstract worry. Strengths: consistent traits and occupation-specific observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but causality breaks at climax: sudden doubt contradicts established debunker resolve without prior setup. Orientation solid by word 120; strong causal linkage otherwise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting charging final image (storms raging anew), but sensory detail over-relies on visual during key beats. Strength: radiation meters concretely constrain choice. Missed opportunity for tactile pressure during reassembly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via diamond discovery, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—letters reassembly happens mechanically without struggle. Cost remains abstract ("weight of truth") rather than visceral. Dominant stake signaled early but not deepened through agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through diamond/stillpoint metaphor; final image reweights "excavate truth" with conceptual cost. Avoids moralizing but slightly over-explains science ("wasn't magic, but exploitable science"). Strong resonance without false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp eyes caught a glint") and rhythmic control in orchard entry. Under stress (reassembly), diction stays uniformly articulate without compression. No POV leakage; consistent voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Shadow of doubt crept in" is therapy-speak label violating embodied emotion. Minor paraphrase loop: "peeling back layers...chained to false hopes" echoes "excavate truth" without added pressure. Final image strong but "weight of truth" slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Trope (cursed object = science) transformed via Liquidation context and debunker POV. Emotional truth in truth-seeking crisis, but premise resembles common post-apocalyptic "hidden oasis" without bold risk-taking. Specific details elevate generic setup.</comment>
