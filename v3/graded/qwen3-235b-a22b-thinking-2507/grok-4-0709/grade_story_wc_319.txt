<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("befriend uncertainty") is clear but stays abstract; lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction feels theoretical rather than embodied struggle during pivotal moments like the pendant ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "uncertainty walked beside it like an old friend" crystallizes the stance with felt cost of eternal displacement. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as density builds toward the foggy lucidity reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Frozen garden functions as active constraint—not backdrop—when cold "seeps into bones" and vines become "mental corridors." The pendant's obsidian surface charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate for micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("Would the rift reopen?") without concrete escalation; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks visible cost paid *during* the scene. Waiting deepens stance but doesn't narrow options per accumulative lens requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "uncertainty walked beside it" reweights displacement as transformation without moralizing. Final image avoids sentimentality by making conceptual cost undeniable through the pendant's cooled ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice has distinct rhythm ("mist clung to every iced petal like forgotten dreams") but "dimensionally homesick" jarringly shifts to clinical diction. Perceptual signature shines in sensory selectivity during high-pressure meditation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "runes ignited softly" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor register drift in "lucid fog" risks thematic echo but avoids muddle. Final line’s "harmonious dance" delivers closure with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: library guardian isn't protector but scholar homesick for "infinite stacks." Risk-taking with poetic abstraction ("interiorizing exteriors") heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
