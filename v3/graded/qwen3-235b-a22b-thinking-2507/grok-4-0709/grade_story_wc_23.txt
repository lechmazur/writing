<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "stitched heart ached with raw solace" – pain and comfort coexist physically. Motivation rooted in drowned lover/scattered family intensifies organically through the build process. Near-flawless embodiment avoids therapy-speak, though hydraulic failure's role in crystallizing choices feels slightly predetermined.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: compass activation reconfigures the station into a beacon with felt cost ("stitched heart ached"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through moon-phase escalation. Slight deduction as the emotional cost in the final image lacks one concrete sensory anchor to push into 9.0 territory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Signal station actively constrains choices: failed hydraulics force reliance on stars/antenna, while the censer foot's physical properties dictate compass construction. Every detail (patina bronze, sea glass lens) charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery – the station isn't backdrop but active pressure point shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten brilliantly through moon phases: faint crescent signals forcing subtle work versus full moon's clarity creates tangible pressure. Navigator's agency drives escalation via deliberate phone calls. Cost is legible in the "raw solace" ache during the locket call, though hydraulic failure's initial impact could resonate more directly in later tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "reverse migration compass" physically embodies navigating grief without abstraction. Final image ("whole in fragmentation") resonates as non-literal answer to loss. Avoids moralizing completely – the censer foot's transformation from relic to beacon reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature: "eyes gleamed like polished compasses" and noticing "patina bronze" hue reveal the navigator's fragmented nature. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Static crackled, then a voice emerged") avoids lyric drift. Minor deduction for "raw solace burned within" – slightly elevated diction that edges toward abstraction in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels action ("hammered pins," "scribbled notes"). Textural specificity dominates ("greenish hue speaking of centuries exposed to sacred smoke"). One near-miss: "vibrating softly now, promising stronger pulses" slightly anthropomorphizes gears – a hairline flaw preventing 9.0 in peak construction beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through concrete mechanics: "reverse migration compass" isn't metaphor but functional object with moon-phase constraints. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Emotional specificity ("guide me back" sob) avoids generic templates – the censer foot's physicality makes loss tangible and irreplaceable.</comment>
