<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "bravely conflicted no more" shift; embodied cost in trembling hands and vertiginous breath fogging air. Label "bravely conflicted" stated but not demonstrated through tradeoffs—micro-choice of scanning letter lacks visible competing impulse beyond initial hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("quiet spun on, dizzying but alive with unspoken words") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual cost (societal upheaval). Causal lens holds: discovery → transmission → fallout. Network activation feels coincidental but complicates without resolving; cost legible in "whispers reached even her depths" showing irrevocable change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen library setting constrains choice (transmission via dormant networks) and charges final image ("dizzying quiet no longer oppressive"). "Frost clinging like forgotten secrets" and breath fogging air integrate sensory detail with emotional state. Snow-bound depth limits escape options, but micro-setting (cryo-pod mechanics) doesn't actively shape tactics beyond discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: letter discovery → moral dilemma → network activation → transmission. Pressure tightens via protagonist's agency (scanning letter) with visible cost (permanent societal rupture). "Dizzying quiet" intensifies stakes but "within the blink" timeframe lacks live-clock tension—surprise-to-action feels instantaneous without tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth's cost emerges through concrete actions (scanning letter), not abstraction. Final image reweights "dizzying quiet" as hopeful charge—resonant answer to "unspoken conversation" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "contraband truths" phrasing borders on prompt-like repetition in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost clung to ancient shelves like forgotten secrets") reflects archivist's mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Her heart pounded in the dizzying quiet") modulates intensity. No dialogue present, but internal thought avoids diagnostic labels. Minor register drift in "systemic corruption" slightly exceeds character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("dormant networks pulsed faintly in the monitors"). "Dizzying quiet" repetition is purposeful motif, not artifact. Slight overwriting in "explosive revelations, banned by the overseers above who maintained societal order through enforced ignorance" bloats momentum. Final line achieves textural specificity with "unspoken words finally finding voice."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryo-archivist + information warfare premise avoids sci-fi clichés. "Contraband truths" as tangible letter (not abstract) grounds moral calculus. Risk-taking in quiet climax succeeds, but "dangerous liaison" trope lacks transformation—relies on familiar political scandal framework without deeper innovation in emotional truth.</comment>
