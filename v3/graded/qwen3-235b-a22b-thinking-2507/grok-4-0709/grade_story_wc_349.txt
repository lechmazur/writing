<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation to find story origins, but interior contradiction lacks depth; "mindfully scattered" trait stated not embodied in choices. Final renunciation of vendor identity earns closure, yet emotional progression remains abstract without visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: absences quantified through cloud swirls/gaps build density toward Charged Poise closure. Cost unmistakable as Elara "quantified her own absence" and releases identity into void at nexus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard roots directly constrain choice by locating story origin; "void-polished obsidian" slates charge final image as "mindfully scattered seeds." Every sensory detail (mercury-dream moonlight, glass fruits) serves closure’s rebirth theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding story origins) tightens via moonlight depletion and numbered absences, but narrative fragments guarding nexus appear abruptly without escalation. Cost legible in identity forfeiture, yet pressure lacks meaningful middle development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "measured voids, incised with light" reweights bottled moonlight’s role without moralizing. Final image’s "scattered seeds" offers resonant non-literal answer to genesis question, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thoughts branching like glass limbs") modulates under pressure; fragmented syntax embodies "mindfully scattered" POV. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s crystalline final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("fragments integrated, fragmenting no more") risk scaffold, but high density propels closure. "Mercury dreams" metaphor coherent; final line’s rhythmic control ("incised with light") achieves propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes via precise mechanics (seven absences per branch); "quantifying absence" method feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes—vendor identity as sacrifice—but avoids gimmickry through closure’s earned rebirth.</comment>
