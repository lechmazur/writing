<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("aesthetically driven soul," "tremor of certainty") without concrete embodiment; contradictory impulses absent as Elias pursues his goal without meaningful struggle, though the final transformation earns motivation through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: boundaries dissolve with conceptual cost (Elias's transformation), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation ("hum growing to tremor," "mist rising"), though cost legibility slightly softens the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium constrains choice (forbidden site demanding paraphrasing) and charges the final image (lake melting into cobalt glow), with sensory details like quartz warmth and lantern-moth hush evolving causally to reweight stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's paraphrasing agency under Accumulative lens: hum intensifies, boundaries blur, and cost (irreversible transformation) is legible in "lantern-moth hush persisted," though stakes lack visceral friction beyond aesthetic peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (paraphrasing dissolving boundaries), with final line "certainty trembles, boundaries dissolve in awe" reweighting the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through resonant image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cloud-shadow poet" noticing quartz faceting, moth-hush) with rhythmic control under pressure; syntactic compression ("Kneeling... traced") modulates intensity while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "aesthetically driven" repetitions slightly muddles peak beats, but high density ("footsteps muffled in lantern-moth hush") and no closure artifacts; propulsion falters only in abstract conceptual phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of poet-as-magician using paraphrasing to dissolve boundaries feels inevitable; emotional specificity in "certainty trembles" avoids genericity, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety margins.</comment>
