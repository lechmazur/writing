<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kai's numbness manifests in embodied micro-choices (blade grip, circling the brain), but the clone's emotional vibrancy lacks sufficient contradiction. Final unity earned through methodical causality, though secondary pressure remains underdeveloped within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("warmth flood his veins"), fulfilling Situational lens. Orientation anchors by word 40; no lens ambiguity despite timeline flux.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating dojo constrains tactics (arena battles, relic access), while the brain-in-jar micro-setting charges the final integration. Sensory specificity ("nebulae where gravity bent") avoids symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kai's agency in rejecting domination for unity, with cost legible in merged identity. History rewrites force stance crystallization without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through complementary opposites in action, not statement. Final image reweights "alive once more" as non-literal answer to numbness, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature filters cosmos through numbness ("mist"), with rhythmic control during battle ("clone lunged first...dispelling phantoms"). Slight dialogue convergence in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in vivification sequence. Minor register drift in "convoluted thread" slightly dulls closure's immediacy without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope through ego death specificity and methodical opposites. Risk-taking in merging selves heightens stakes while maintaining coherence through dojo logic.</comment>
