<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elowen's contradictory impulses (spectral silence vs. yearning for connection) drive credible micro-choices under thunder's pressure, but Lira's kinship feels slightly over-calibrated without deeper friction. "Hear me, free me" plea embodies motivation, yet "unspoken needs" abstraction edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visceral cost (thunder's boom during liberation), and causal chain holds from glitch to freedom. Weakness: Lightning/thunder timeframe sets urgency but fails to meaningfully tighten options beyond initial setup, missing one escalation beat for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (bolt alignment pre-thunder) and charges the final image. Environment remains atmospheric backdrop—courtyard doesn't pressure tactics beyond providing wall surface, failing Q3 9+ gate's requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (freedom vs. eternal silence) escalate through Elowen's encoding under thunder's approach, with agency-driven payoff. Cost (thunder's timing) feels coincidental rather than earned by pressure escalation; dominant stake lacks deepening into moral complexity or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through graffiti's binary blossoms ("roses scripted with ones and zeros"), avoiding direct statement. Final image reweights silence into "tinkersong wonder" but "unspoken needs" abstraction in narration risks thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("driftingly alert gaze," "tinkersong wonder" lexicon) modulates under pressure, though "pulsed with anticipation of tempests" drifts into overwritten abstraction. Dual-POV shift to Lira remains coherent through shared curiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density falters with minor scaffold: "seldom-heard" repetition and "driftingly alert" synonym churn in thunder sequence. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but "whispers of wind, seldom reaching mortal ears" duplicates "seldom-heard balladeer" with no added pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ghost in code" with tinkerer aesthetics (flower press as encoder) transforms tropes through specific, verifiable details. Premise echoes "discovered magic" templates but gains originality via binary graffiti mechanics and emotional specificity in the bolt plate's function.</comment>
