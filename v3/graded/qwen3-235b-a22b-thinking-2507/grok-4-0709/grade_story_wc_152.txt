<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "burned quietly within her" uses label-only phrasing; embodied contradiction shines in her foolish giggle mirroring the vizier tale, though micro-choices lack visible cost escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks unmistakable cost—"might yet echo into silence" implies soft reset; Accumulative lens holds but Earned Stasis fails as no tangible forfeiture occurs on-page during unraveling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cobalt walls actively constrain choice by "absorb[ing] the sounds" during synchronization; autumn’s chill and eternal candle’s flame charge the final image with specificity that reweights prior embroidery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling conspiracies) tightens via synchronization beats, but escalation lacks causal pressure—revelations accumulate without narrowing Elara’s options or altering tactics with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embroidery-as-listening metaphor, but "to listen for unheard stories" in paragraph 3 states thesis outright, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in non-final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stitching warnings into the fabric") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control falters only in filter-verb stacks ("she began to synchronize, her needle dipping") during high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Overwriting in "casting elongated shadows that echoed the silence of impending secrets" muddles physical logic; paraphrase loops ("echoed silence" repeated 4x) dull closure’s propulsion despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Embroiderer-as-cosmic-cartographer transforms coup tropes through tactile metaphor, but observatory setting remains generic—"cobalt" lacks unique constraints beyond aesthetic, capping originality.</comment>
