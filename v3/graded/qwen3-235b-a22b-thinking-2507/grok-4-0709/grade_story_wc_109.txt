<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("map endless night") drives action yet no visible tradeoffs or flaws complicate choices, weakening causality for closure. Mild obsession remains label-bound without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (booklet closed against void) lands with conceptual cost via flaking gold, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—storm pressure never alters tactics. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost legibility falters in "enriching the hush" phrasing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (flaking booklet) constrains choice by forcing urgency as gold detaches, charging the final image. Sensory details ("marbled hush," "twilight quill") filter through oracle’s silence-focused bias, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (map before oblivion) signaled early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully; storm rattles fort yet fails to narrow options or alter tactics. No escalation beyond atmospheric dread, missing the 8.0+ requirement of foreclosed paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "summarizing silence" as tangible mapmaking, avoiding moralizing. Final image (sealed booklet) reweights oblivion as preserved hush—a resonant CR without stated moral, leveraging concrete particulars over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing silences, not sights) and rhythmic control under pressure excel. Minor register drift in "ambered hush" risks abstraction but earns weight through repetition. No head-hopping; voice modulates with fading star.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density, but stacked metaphors in climax ("flakes drifted like autumn leaves... enriching hush") blur cost legibility. Propulsion falters slightly in overwrought beats, yet closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "silence as map" transforms tropes through specific mechanics (twilight quill, pebble wisdom). Emotional truth in quiet endurance avoids gimmickry, with risk-taking heightening stakes via conceptual closure.</comment>
