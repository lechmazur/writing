<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Elara's "perceptively calm" trait remains untested during emotional reveals. Diagnostic label-speak ("transmuting our hurts") triggers -0.6 penalty in peak beats. Micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite villagers' trauma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("mended hearts") satisfies Accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract assertion ("pain transmuted into bonds") without on-page legibility. Orientation test passed (field/ruins anchored by para 1), yet "peace settled like dew" fails cost proof test—no concrete sacrifice shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid lavender/vines imagery creates atmosphere, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The bench and map case lack causal pressure on choices; final "dew" image charges tone but environment doesn't alter tactics. Micro-setting potential underutilized despite sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collective healing) signaled early, but escalation lacks coherent pressure under Accumulative lens. Arc-weaving deepens meaning yet narrows no options—Lila's vine insight feels unearned without prior resistance. Conceptual cost ("mended hearts") remains abstract, failing band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through arcs→vines→mural transformation without moralizing. Final image ("peace settled like dew") offers resonant non-literal answer to "can pain become bonds?" Earned via Lila's vine insight, avoiding thematic echo despite "transmute" dialogue near-miss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("perceptively calm eyes scanning for patterns") and rhythmic control shine in descriptions. But "earnest whimsy" tone flattens under pressure—no syntactic shift when trauma surfaces. Filter-verb stacks ("she lingered," "she placed") dull immediacy despite otherwise clean focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Severe filter-verb stacks ("Elara moved," "she carried," "she opened") cluster in high-pressure beats, triggering -0.7 penalty. Template cadence ("As vines climbed...") repeats 4x with identical structure, dulling closure image. Purple prose ("emerald ribbons") muddles causality in peak moments despite lyrical strengths.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms "community healing" trope through photographic arcs method—fresh synthesis of visual puzzle and collective trauma. Emotional specificity in Mr. Harlan's hammer/bridge connection avoids generic templates. But lavender/ruins juxtaposition lacks bold risk-taking, settling for familiar melancholy.</comment>
