<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied in "claustrophobia clawed... suffocating cage" versus dream of "flavors of different silences"; micro-choices like whispering fears into doll show hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "brew a peace vast enough" edges toward label-only but redeemed by concrete actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "Time pressed as inversion hour waned" forcing rushed nexus collection. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in silence types, though causality weakens slightly during trellis exploration where gravity mechanics could tighten stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Porcelain doll functions as micro-setting that charges final image ("sipped the essences, each taste expanding the walls"). Trellis vines' "rustling in friendly murmur" concretely constrains tactics by requiring noise limitation during collection, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each silence collection deepens the dominant stake (claustrophobia vs. expansive peace) with visible cost in waning inversion time. "Trembling hands" at nexus crystallizes irreversible commitment with felt opportunity cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of sipping essences "turning confinement into canvas for skyward dreams" reweights claustrophobia through concrete action without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from "gilded hush" symphony reframing silence as liberation, avoiding abstraction through sensory particulars like "bitter edge of solitary stars".</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "silences hung like ripe fruits" reflecting character-specific sensory priorities. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in clipped syntax during inversion ("ground repelled her, tumbled skyward") without sacrificing lyrical density of silence flavors.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "intangibly tangible" repetition risks stock phrasing but earns cohesion through Charged Poise payoff. Minor overwriting in "velvety mute of cloud-shadows" compensated by strong verbs like "sprouting it by whispering a barrier spell".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms claustrophobia trope through silence-collecting mechanics and gravity inversion. Emotional specificity in "stretching contracted soul" avoids generic templates; conceptual integrity in treating silence as cultivatable resource reshapes familiar magical realism.</comment>
