<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in suppressed creativity vs. artistic hunger, embodied through charcoal-stained hands and trembling unpacking; micro-choice to paint a mechanism (not force chest) reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in final tears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost—"tears welled as creativity uncorked" crystallizes the emotional price of reclaimed artistry; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through auroral sorrow deepening to renewal without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave crystals constrain choice (forcing improvised pulley from vines/shards) and charge the final image—portrait’s "glowing melancholy" refracting light onto Elias’ renewed sketching proves micro-setting necessity for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias’ agency: lock discovery → memory-triggered backstory → painting-as-tool choice; cost is legible in hollow years ("corked his soul") and tears, though internal/external conflict interweaving remains optional at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal/cork metaphors without moralizing; final sketching offers non-literal answer to "lost potentials," but "auroral sorrow" recurrence risks near-symbolic convenience without deeper constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "charcoal-fingered hands trembling" and "frozen dawn" hues; rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented clauses ("Force would damage... he couldn’t risk that") avoids head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "veins of quartz pulsed like trapped auroras" avoids mixed metaphor; propulsion via concrete verbs ("unpacked," "tugged," "dancing") though "mnemonically gifted" slightly drifts into elevated diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of crystal cave as emotional crucible—not just setting but active constraint (vines/shards for pulley); risk-taking in painting-mechanism solution heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
