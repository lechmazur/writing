<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("vigor pulsed like hidden heartbeat") but micro-choices shine: hands moving "with muted vigor" as silent prayer during tuning reveals hierarchy of values through tactile specificity. Flaws lack compounding mistakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "wonder's color shone undimmed" crystallizes options with felt cost in "fragile magic binding all." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase in final glisten sequence reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Whispering bluff isn't backdrop but active constraint: perpetual mist enables light refraction pivotal to closure, while altitude ("clouds below") supplies "scent of distant rains" that triggers the kinetic dance. Micro-setting (iceberg fragment) charges final image irreplaceably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative density: the sculpture’s construction deepens commitment as winter tightens, narrowing options to this final act. Cost is legible in Elara’s deepening muteness during work and the "fragile magic" line—agency-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "color of wonder" motif reweighted by final glisten: "shone undimmed" offers non-literal answer to fading wonder without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character articulates thesis, preserving earned ambiguity about silence's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds swirled below like forgotten dreams") modulates rhythm under pressure: short clauses during kinetic activation ("Then it came—a whispering wind...") heighten tension. Patterned elision taught early pays off in closure's silent eloquence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "forged a framework of slender, wind-kissed metals" compresses action without scaffold. Minor abstraction ("motivation burned quietly") avoids penalty; final line "wonder's color shone undimmed" crystallizes density with zero loops in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes "artist saves culture" trope through specific mechanics: iceberg’s light refraction as truth-revealer feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—transformation test passed via kinetic sculpture’s irreplaceable physics.</comment>
