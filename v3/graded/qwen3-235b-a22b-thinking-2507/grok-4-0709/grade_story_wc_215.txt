<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elias' composed astonishment; embodied emotion via "faint honey" tending and refracted-light gazing. Motivation ("preserve weight of unspoken words") drives the hive-placement choice with visible cost in his "peace," though micro-choices lack deeper tactical struggle mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the inscription "For the weights we carry in silence" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost—his lifelong regret transformed into purpose. Orientation anchors within 50 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as patterned light/refraction deepens meaning without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (stained glass box) constrains choice: refracted spectral light enables inscription reading, charging the final image where bees guard it with "vigilant hum." Hives actively pressure tactics—Elias places the box in the largest hive specifically for their protection, avoiding ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring unspoken words) tightens via ghostly light revealing the inscription, changing knowledge and foreclosing prying. Cost is conceptual (carrying silence's weight) but not visibly dramatized; the rubric permits felt cost for Accumulative lens, yet specificity lacks physical consequence on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: bees symbolize preserved essence, refracted light embodies memory, and the final image ("silent heart") answers the central question without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo; "mute eloquence" resonates through ghostly gestures and humming bees, charging closure with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("refracting spectral colors that danced like memories") reflects Elias' tranquilly perceptive nature. Rhythmic control modulates from contemplative long sentences to crystalline closure, with no head-hopping—ghost's presence filtered solely through his POV observation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "splintered by relentless heat" and "vigilant hum" showcase textural specificity. Every line advances atmosphere or character, with metaphors serving POV ("danced like memories"). Final line recharges "mute eloquence" motif without stating meaning, achieving propulsion and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through specific context—spectral figures as "heat haze" refracting light that reveals truth. Emotional specificity in "tangled covenant" avoids abstraction; risk-taking in quiet closure pays off via bees guarding silence. Lacks one bold structural risk to reach 9+.</comment>
