<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation (restore practices) drives action, but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices like selecting the tendril reveal values, yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped beyond dedication versus decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: the moon fades as the arbor revives, crystallizing the trade-off in "Elias smiled whimsically, unwrapping the now-vibrant tendril" under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The vine tendril constrains choice (channeling energy) and charges the final image; setting details like brittle vines actively shape the ritual’s urgency and Elias’s physical actions throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the harvest moon deadline, with Elias’s singing driving escalation; cost is legible in the expended effort and fading moon, though the singular pressure lacks layered trade-offs for the 9-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tendril’s transformation and hush-to-birdsong arc, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "forgotten energies" as lived renewal without abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gears and gadgets" mind filtering nature) and rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; the "gathering hush" motif evolves organically with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "vines stirred, tendrils unfurling like sleepy children" advancing atmosphere and plot simultaneously, though one near-cliché ("curling like a question mark") slightly dulls peak intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ritual tropes through tinkerer-specific mechanics (stories as "golden" energy channels); emotional truth in communal loss avoids generic eco-parable, though the whimsy archetype edges close to safety.</comment>
