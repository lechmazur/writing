<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in incubating visions versus releasing loves; embodied "breath caught in hushed thunder" avoids labels. Spatially imaginative trait lacks pressure-testing tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("awaiting their moment"); Accumulative lens holds via psychometry deepening. Orientation clear by word 40 with booth/dust motes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projector’s warmth literally incubates love, constraining the magical act; "sprocket holes" and "reels" charge final image. Slightly generic "vintage movie palace" limits specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through psychometry’s deepening (frames → realms); cost legible in "archived, awaiting their moment." Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges via "film strip warm in her grasp" reprise; avoids moralizing but "unused love wasn’t lost" borders on direct statement. Final action reweights premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "mapping invisible corridors"; rhythm modulates from "dust motes danced" to thunderous hush. Zero head-hopping; elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No scaffold loops; "hushed thunder" metaphor evolves organically. Slight density spike in "rooms within rooms unfolding" but payoff justifies. Closure beat pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with film archiving; "incubate visions like eggs in a nest" transforms trope. Avoids sentimental safety middle through archival metaphor.</comment>
