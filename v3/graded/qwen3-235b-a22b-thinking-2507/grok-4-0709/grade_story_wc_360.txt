<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's fragmented identity versus mathematical quest, but "passionate turbulence" leans toward abstract label over embodied contradiction during peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("quest was both triumph and turmoil") lands with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through vanishing stars tightening options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Topaz workshop constrains choice during vision spin ("walls refracting stars into turbulent patterns") and charges final image; minor over-description of boulder carving slightly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency (printing phrases) under Accumulative lens as stars vanish; conceptual cost of accepting unsolvability is legible but could resonate more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (transposed empathy prints) not abstraction; final image reweights "mathematics of emotion" with resonant non-literal answer avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured mirrors," "lucid turbulence") with rhythmic control during disorientation; elision of backstory taught early and paid off in borrowing mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("turbulent patterns"/"whirlwind of light") in high-pressure beat; otherwise high density with clean propulsion through cosmic decay imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptic printing + emotion math avoids trope; specific topaz powder ink and vellum transforms abstract premise into visceral stakes with risk-taking coherence.</comment>
