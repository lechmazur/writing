<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "seeking closure opened wounds" and embodied pain during visions; minor motivation gap where plants' "Dig deeper" whisper slightly eases her pivotal choice without prior cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("tears streamed," grief resurfacing) under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchored by word 15 with "dawn in quiet tower," avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower functions as micro-setting: vines guide actions and charge closure (final touch/gratitude); hourglass constrains choice via inversion and sand reversal, meeting 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory density (coffee rings → scar visions), but escalation leans slightly on external forces (plants/hourglass) rather than pure protagonist agency during the pivotal "tunnel" realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through scar narratives and "meteor hush" reweighting; final image ("embrace their tales") avoids moralizing while resonating with prior pain-as-story motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via plant telepathy ("green murmurs," "thoughts blooming") modulates under stress with fragmented syntax ("Tunnel, she realized"); zero voice contamination despite no dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sands inside glowing faintly" → "sands defy gravity"); minor deduction for "profound silence" cliché in high-pressure opening beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "displaced miracle" with coffee-ring divination avoids trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, though plant telepathy edges near convenience.</comment>
