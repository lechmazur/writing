<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in sensory perception ("hollow silence," "reed-blown melancholy") avoids therapy-speak, but emotional calibration is overly tidy—grief resolves into "lightened closure" without contradictory impulses during pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("heart heavy with understanding"), but Thorne's sudden confession and seashell mechanics feel retroactively convenient, triggering -0.8 Non-closure Accumulation Cap for one distinct causality slip near climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Canyon setting actively constrains choices (forked path dictates movement, echoes as tactical resource), and the seashell—handled across three beats—charges the final image; "universe hums" abstraction slightly dilutes micro-setting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why voices echo) tightens through Elara's micro-choices, but escalation lacks friction—Thorne shifts stance too readily when she shares her mother's story, muting the cost of his manipulation until the final unraveling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through echoes as metaphor, but final line ("all were part of the universe's melancholic chorus") edges toward thematic echo, risking sentimentality despite strong subtext in the seashell's reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("senses attuned to subtlest shifts") sustains voice under pressure, but "indifferent gaze of the cosmos" momentarily drifts into generic lyricism, disrupting Elara's embodied POV in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Near-duplicate phrasing ("vanished into silence"/"hollow silence") and slight cadence monotony in revelation beat ("whispered... spoke... pressed") create minor scaffold; no closure-dulling artifacts but density suffers during pivotal union of seashell halves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "echo" mechanics with emotional resonance feels inevitable, but canyon echo singer trope lacks transformative risk—elevated by poetic specificity yet avoids bold structural or moral ambiguity that could elevate to 9.0+.</comment>
