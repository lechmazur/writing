<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("spark of defiance") remains abstract despite high-stakes action; Elias lacks contradictory impulses in climax. Mira’s sole purpose is delivering tax-rate exposition, reducing her to secondary-pressure token.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: final image ("planted... revolution") reweights rebellion as organic proliferation with visible cost (drones crashing, enforcers' neural confusion). Late bioengineering reveal slightly weakens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting that charges closure: aphids form living scripts during escape, carnivorous plants pressure movement. Vines-as-neural-pathways opening metaphor pays off through the gourd’s reality-warping growth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’ agency (planting ritual → gourd activation), but "converging chaos" pressure feels externally imposed. Cost is legible (drones crashing) yet lacks personal forfeiture beyond immediate tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final line ("planted... revolution") replaces earned resonance with prompt-like moralizing, triggering -0.6 penalty. Core concept (thought commodification) integrates through flora codes but lacks moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("beetles hummed like forbidden whispers") sustains under pressure. Dialogue avoids therapy-speak but "dryness invites rain" line borders on thematic echo, slightly muddying voice in peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Thoughts taxed into confusion" uses diagnostic label in high-pressure beat (-0.5 artifact penalty). Otherwise strong propulsion; "flickering ember of rebellion" avoids cliché through concrete entomological framing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transforms "thought police" trope via entomological specificity (pheromone-warped gourds, aphid scripts). Risks lyrical compression but "community gardens as code" premise lacks emotional depth beyond intellectual novelty.</comment>
