<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (homesick for time yet conducting forward) drives micro-choices like tracing shell ridges; embodied exhaustion ("limbs heavy, breaths shallow") earns the final stance shift without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elias succeeds "before exhaustion hit" with visible cost (physical depletion), reconfiguring time's arrow under Accumulative lens; dawn's arrival tightens options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nautilus shell constrains every key choice—from memory mapping to the final conducting gesture—and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement through active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elias's agency: exhaustion narrows his window to map memories before dawn, with the cost (drained strength) altering his final conduct; dominant stake crystallizes early but could escalate sooner.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the shell's evolving symbolism—spiral as recursion, then symphony score—culminating in the non-literal fortune "In spirals of memory, conduct the dawn" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice modulates flawlessly under pressure: "upturned hush" shifts to "silent crescendo" with Elias's perceptual signature (noticing light fractures, shell hums), avoiding head-hopping in single-POV lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-loop in "whispering secrets of growth and recursion" followed by "method to unlock the path" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise impeccable density and rhythm serve the high-pressure ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Chronological homesickness" transforms a familiar trope through specific sensory logic; risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
