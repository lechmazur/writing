<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("texture of borrowed time") but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; final endurance feels unearned despite vivid interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("seeds of time to plant in fertile chaos"); Accumulative lens held through entropy-driven intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound atrium constrains choices (cold biting robes) and charges final image, but micro-setting integration lacks tactical pressure beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Stakes deepen through entropy method, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "texture" motivation isn't tested through trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through vortex imagery, but final line's "wild serenity eternal" triggers thematic echo penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline patterns," "silken roughness") with controlled rhythm, though "furiously tranquil" repetition weakens peak-beat modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters in climax: "wild serenity" repeats 3x within 10 lines, dulling closure image despite otherwise precise lyrical control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal physics and seed-saving heritage, but vortex inheritance feels derivative of portal fantasy tropes without deeper transformation.</comment>
