<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "quietly driven" pursuit versus need for audience, embodied through mural creation and postcard decoding. Final choice to paint night flowers earns closure via grandmother's legacy, but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with "tenderness thrives in umbral spaces" revelation. Cost proven in "tears came softly as Elara reckoned with it all," yet lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) triggering -0.3 penalty despite strong payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber pavilion functions as micro-setting: its translucent walls literally charge closure when dawn light reveals etched message. Autumn leaves "glowing like embers" constrain final mural choice, satisfying 9+ gate by shaping the ending image with embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through cathedral window revelations, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the "melting snow" timeframe creates texture without tightening decisions. Band guardrail violated: no visible price altering tactics before closure despite resonant final cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through night-blooming jasmine's energy conservation metaphor reweighting legacy and grief. Final mural action answers "why flowers bloom at night" with earned resonance, though cross-cap from Q4 ≤7.1 caps score at 8.0 per no-escalation rule.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: winter "muddy pools" mirror emotional state while cathedral light "pierced etched layers" reflects dawning clarity. Rhythmic control intensifies perfectly at climax with fragmented phrasing for revelation moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats with exquisite propulsion ("light pierced... casting shadows that danced with tenderness"). Near-flawless density, though "tears came softly as Elara reckoned with it all" contains adjacent "reckon" variants (-0.2 scaffold) preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms legacy trope through specific botanical precision (night blooms conserving energy) and etched-glass revelation method. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable, but grandmother's deathbed mystery setup edges toward template territory, blocking 9.0.</comment>
