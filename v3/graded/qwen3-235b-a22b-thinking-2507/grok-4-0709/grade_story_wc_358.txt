<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "cultivating foresight" told not shown through conflicted choices. Diagnostic label-speak ("her motivation burned steadily") triggers anti-pattern penalty without embodied cost. Final endurance lacks earned causality for true character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (city's silence vs. patch/charts promise), but cost legibility falters at "scarred horizon" image—feels observational rather than Mara's personal price. Accumulative lens holds through wind pattern density, though orientation anchors just clear the 120-word test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Container labyrinth actively constrains choices (navigation, wind funnel effect) and charges closure via "funnel effect" discovery. Fog/haze motif evolves from atmospheric to thematic constraint, reweighted in final "hazy precision" stance. Micro-setting (anemometers) directly enables climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing future disasters) tightens via patch discovery deepening convergence theory, but escalation lacks Mara's agency-driven tradeoffs. Cost remains conceptual (city's silence) rather than viscerally felt on-page; "scarred horizon" implies cost but doesn't charge it decisively under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wind physics rather than moralizing, with final image reweighting "singular convergence" via patch/charts. Avoids thematic echo but "foresight needed to avert next" edges toward prompt-like assertion, slightly diluting earned resonance in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hazy precision," wind vortices) sustains under pressure with rhythmic control. Elevated diction ("clung like a shroud") briefly clashes with investigator POV in high-stakes beat, but compression of reflection stays purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Scaffold loops weaken momentum ("Mara pursued... Mara's task... Mara navigated") and filter verbs cluster in pressure beat ("she paused... she recalibrated"). Near-closure image ("hazy precision held") avoids muddle but synonym churn in mid-section triggers -0.4 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster physics and human error through container wind dynamics, avoiding tropes via specific anemometer details. Slightly academic "singular convergence" concept limits emotional specificity, though risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
