<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied (e.g., bell "cool against his palm"), but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal moments; youth unrest is noted but never tests his resolve internally, preventing true 9.0-level interior conflict despite strong specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with earned Earned Stasis closure: sanctions persist but anonymity ends with visible cost (community's shift to declared parcels), though "amplified quiet" repetition slightly undermines the final image's organic charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and bell function as micro-setting that constrains choices (summons via ridge vantage) and charges closure; "dusty paths" and "scavenged grains" offer tactile specificity, but "amplified quiet" leans abstract over physical sensation in key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unity vs. sanctions) tightens through Elias's declaration, but escalation lacks agency—youth unrest remains off-page murmur, not direct pressure forcing his choice; cost is felt (endured sanctions) but not actively earned through prior trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through "midnight runs" evolving into "communal harvests," avoiding moralizing, but "build intergenerational support" stays abstract; final image reweights unity without stating morals, though elder-youth bonds lack concrete demonstration beyond smiles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Elias noticing "scattered lights," "flickering lamps") and rhythmic control shine, but "amplified quiet" becomes a tic; voice modulates well until climax where sentence rhythms don't sufficiently intensify with rising stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, yet "gently persistent" (5x) and "amplified quiet" (4x) create subtle synonym loops; "tarnished but resonant" shows strong verbs, but lyrical repetitions in high-pressure beats slightly dull closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms exile tropes through specific details (terra-cotta arbor as "relic," milk powder for newborn), but resolution feels safe—sanctions persist without showing tangible unity benefits, missing a fresh inflection for 9.0+ risk-taking.</comment>
