<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("vulnerable voices," "reeling hush" as emotional state) undermines embodied interiority during the pivotal cottage scene, where therapy-adjacent phrasing replaces contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Hybrid) weakens causality past midpoint; the hearing aid's sudden tuning capability feels convenient rather than earned, muddying pressure escalation toward the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details (mist, condensation) lack constraint on choices; the photograph's physicality never alters tactics despite handling, failing the 9+ gate where environment must charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally ("reeling hush" intensifying) but lack visible cost scaling—Elara's abandonment of her personal quest isn't dramatized as a trade-off, leaving escalation feeling observational rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic echo in the final line ("proving that tracing hearts could heal more than intended") replaces earned resonance with stated moral, undercutting the otherwise strong subtext of incidental connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured pasts," "forgotten breaths") erodes under stress into repetitive cadence ("reeling hush" as tic); register drift occurs when clinical terms ("amplifying," "attuned") clash with lyrical voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwritten high-pressure beats ("fog swirled like forgotten breaths, amplifying the reeling hush") create mixed metaphors that blur causality; template cadence ("Elara adjusted... Elara was...") dulls momentum in the discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Familiar ghost-story tropes (hearing aid as spirit conduit) lack transformative specificity; emotional complexity is hedged by safe middle choices (universal "healing" theme) rather than bold, character-grounded risk.</comment>
