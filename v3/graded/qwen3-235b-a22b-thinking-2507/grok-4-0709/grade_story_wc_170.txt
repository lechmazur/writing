<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; borrowed heartbeat motivates but lacks simultaneous competing impulses. Embodied emotion limited to "pulsed faintly" without visceral cost during mirage creation. Final endurance feels unearned despite setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with mirrors showing possibilities and heartbeat cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, but heartbeat repayment lacks tangible mid-scene constraint. Final bell toll provides sufficient cadence shift for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism parapet functions as micro-setting, refracting light to charge final image. Rain-scented air and terrace echoes actively constrain choices by enabling mirage mechanics. "Post-rain glow" directly shapes the closure's visual logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (altering mirror reality) tightens through humming escalation, but heartbeat cost remains abstract. No visible trade-off when mirrors stir; repayment threat doesn't narrow options during climax. Pressure grows texturally yet lacks tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through prism/refraction motif reweighted in final "spring petals" image. Avoids moralizing by showing possibilities rather than stating hope. Slightly over-reliant on "borrowed" metaphor but closure's conceptual repricing lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in "prism that scattered rainbows" and "dusky harmony" lexicon. Focalization consistent through painter's sensory lens. Minor overuse of "perceptively calm" dilutes specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding; "shimmering figures on the air itself" exemplifies dual-purpose prose. Template cadence in "He painted... His perceptively calm eyes..." triggers -0.2. No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms mirage trope through prism physics and heartbeat mechanics. Emotional truth in "temporary loan" metaphor outweighs familiar painter archetype. Risk in Accumulative structure pays off through cohesive sensory logic.</comment>
