<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "shivering bliss" repeats as diagnostic label-speak in peak beats triggering penalty. Motivation clear but flaw-driven choices absent despite withdrawn trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks unmistakable cost legibility; "dawn's illusion" reconfiguration feels abstract without concrete forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative) holds but escalation density insufficient for high band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains choices via elixir-dependent fruits and vine patterns; final image of "orbs of pure potential" charges closure through recurring loamy soil/object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("shape of possibility"); tightening occurs but cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. Agency visible yet pressure lacks tangible trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("no longer just a knight...") states resolution overtly, violating organic emergence. Central question reweighted only through abstract allegory, not concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via alchemical lexicon and rhythmic control; "vines twisted like veins of liquid gold" exemplifies voice-motivated compression. No POV slippage despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" repetition creates paraphrase loops in climax; "reality shifted" cadence runs dull immediacy. Final-beat artifacts disallow 9+ globally per policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marionette allegory with alchemy feels inevitable, but "endless night" trope lacks transformation. Emotional specificity anchors universals through orchard's tactile logic.</comment>
