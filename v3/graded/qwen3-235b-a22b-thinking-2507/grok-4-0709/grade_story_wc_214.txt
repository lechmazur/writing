<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in self-doubt vs spiritual seeking, but "vulnerability etched in fire" uses therapy-speak in peak beat, weakening embodied emotion. Final choice earned through star-tracing ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with cost (shedding isolation), but lens ambiguity: shifts from accumulative texture to causal motivation ("motivation crystallized") at climax undermines coherence. Orientation clear by 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when refracting star trails and charging final image. "Primal elegance" repetition overpowers sensory specificity in critical beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-worth through vulnerability) tightens via star's fracture pattern, but cost legibility falters—Elara's "renewed purpose" lacks visceral forfeiture. Agency clear but escalation lacks felt price in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through star-tracing metaphor, but fatal Thematic Echo: "her motivation crystallized—to find strength in vulnerability" in penultimate paragraph replaces earned resonance with stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ethereal dust," "machinery purring") persists under pressure, but "primal elegance" refrain creates uniform tics. Consistent focalization though reflection exceeds 20% without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Through the hush...") and synonym churn ("flourishing stillness" ×3) in final third dull closure image. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she sensed") in climax trigger -0.5 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic janitor trope with vulnerability theme, but "primal elegance" label lacks transformation. Derivative premise guardrail applies—core concept mirrors common spiritual tropes without sufficient specificity.</comment>
