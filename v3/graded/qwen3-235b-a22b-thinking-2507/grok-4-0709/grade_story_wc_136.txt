<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mapping escapes instead of facing pain" confession, but "bad habits shatter" resolution feels unearned—cost lacks visceral embodiment despite strong micro-choices early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise at fortress entrance, but cost remains conceptual; "shattered bad habits" lacks on-page legibility. Orientation anchors ("abandoned train yard," "midnight") clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pavement cracks as micro-setting constrain choices (stepping over arrows), charging the final image. Mist thickens meaningfully, though "starlit vault" leans decorative without altering tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (punching confession ticket), but "bad habits dissolving" resolution lacks visible cost—escalation driven by lens-consistent accumulation, yet cost proof test fails for 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unspoken truths" fortress metaphor without moralizing, but "analytically artistic soul forever changed" edges toward sentimentality; final image reweights avoidance vs. revelation coherently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fissures began to shift" observations, but "trembling certainty" repetition (4x) creates tic-like cadence under pressure, diluting rhythmic control at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but "trembling certainty" synonym churn and therapy-speak ("mapping escapes instead of facing pain") in peak beats trigger minor artifacts; prose propulsion falters during ticket-punching sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "confront truth" trope via route-mapper lens—phantom ticket mechanic feels fresh. Emotional specificity elevates, though "midnight as dividing hour" borrows familiar symbolism without sufficient reinvention.</comment>
