<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("luminous torment") with insufficient contradictory impulses in-scene; final crane release lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy beyond stated motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: shadow's lingering presence charges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost ("some luminosities burned eternal") under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid setting lacks tactical constraint; tea garden and basilica function as backdrop rather than pressure points. Recurring lanterns charge the ending but don't alter mid-scene choices, narrowly missing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("kaleidoscope of luminous agony"), with gem polishing as pivotal intensification. Cost is unmistakable in tears and the unresolved shadow, driven entirely by Elias's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final image ("shadow lingered... some luminosities burned eternal") reweights grief without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal answer through concrete particulars of detached shadow and luminous cranes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("tormenting glows on blooming lotuses"); rhythmic control modulates perfectly from "luminous haze" to fragmented intensity during polishing ritual, with all elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "tears streamed down his face, glowing faintly" compresses emotion without scaffold. Minor synonym drift ("radiant memories"/"luminous torment") in mid-scene prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes grief tropes through specific mechanics (dream-recording lanterns); "luminous torment" transforms abstract emotion into embodied constraint. Risks poetic density without sacrificing clarity at closure.</comment>
