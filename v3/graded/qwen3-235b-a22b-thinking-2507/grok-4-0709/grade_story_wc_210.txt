<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in peak moments; 'false comfort' label not dramatized with physical cost within 2-3 lines of rejection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ('buried bottle' as illusion reminder), but townsfolk return via off-page 'word spread' slightly weakens Accumulative pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lanterns evolve from 'forgotten dreams' to symbols of 'shared stories,' constraining Elias' revival method and charging the final 'real flame' image with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through memory accumulation narrowing options to manual revival; conceptual cost (eternal peace wish scattering people) legibly reweights the lantern-lighting climax under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bottle/lantern duality without moralizing; final image of 'real flame' reweights folly as earned resilience, avoiding thematic echo despite near-abstraction in 'honest toil' phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct alchemist perceptual signature ('weavers' patterns inspired by waves') with rhythmic compression under stress; minor generic phrase ('mind burned') prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful lyricism ('faded lanterns like forgotten dreams'), but 'deceitful allure' edges toward cliché; no closure-impairing loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Working-memory revival method transforms ghost-town trope with cognitive specificity; 'amber bottle with no opening' grounds abstract folly in irreplaceable physical constraint.</comment>
