<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("theoretically rebellious" vs safe academic life) manifests in micro-choices like following graffiti, but "clover melancholy" functions as diagnostic label rather than embodied emotion in peak beats, triggering penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("chance was neither enemy nor savior"), but lantern's appearance relies on coincidence rather than causal buildup, creating one distinct non-closure issue that caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mica lantern constrains choice (filtering light while threatening books) and charges final image (pocketing sliver); rainwashed library's leakiness plausibly explains lantern's storage, meeting 9+ gate through micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake (bridging calculated/chaotic approaches to chance) tightens through accumulating textual clues, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the graffiti directs rather than tests her commitment, missing band guardrail for visible price charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lantern's physical properties (contained/wild flame) rather than stated morals; final image reweights "lucid contradictions" with conceptual cost without thematic echo, satisfying 9+ quick test flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct academic-poetic voice ("probability could betray") modulates under pressure, but "clover melancholy" recurs as static label rather than evolving perceptual signature, weakening rhythmic control in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful specifics ("iridescent mica pane"), but "theoretically rebellious" appears in identical constructions (template cadence) and library description leans generic, creating minor scaffold that dulls mid-beat momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms gambling trope through probability professor lens; "lucid contradictions" synthesizes math/chaos organically. Risk-taking with textual clues pays off coherently, meeting 9+ quick test through earned inevitability.</comment>
