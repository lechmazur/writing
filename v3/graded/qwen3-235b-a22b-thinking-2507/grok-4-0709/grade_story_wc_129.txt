<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "boldly sympathetic" drives action but lacks embodied tension under pressure. "Luminescent ache" label replaces specific physicality during key searches.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—no visible sacrifice for belonging. Backstory reflection exceeds BRR limits, summarizing without altering tactics mid-search.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orchard’s crystalline flora creates vivid atmosphere but fails 9+ gate: setting never constrains choices (e.g., crater fumes tempt but don’t alter search tactics).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; no narrowing of options despite "perilous edges." Community hesitation resolves via reed talismans without trade-offs, violating escalation requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme stated explicitly in final paragraph ("bold sympathy the light"), triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Kinship "webs" recur but lack charged specificity at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/texture focus) sustains voice. Minor POV drift in backstory about "lost languages" slightly undermines focalization control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in peak beats: "luminescent ache" repeated 4× without evolution. Template cadence in search sequence ("One found... another uncovered") dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh setting details (quartz fruits, obsidian arbor) ground the premise, but "grafting" metaphor feels derivative without bold risk-taking in execution.</comment>
