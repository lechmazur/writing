<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (calm precision vs competitive drive) act simultaneously in the challenge; his final renunciation of brute force is earned through premeditated study and visible cost in Marcus's defeated trudge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Marcus's "defeated trudge" and Scorpio coin flip crystallize the conceptual cost of failed shouting, with the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through auroral pressure intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth actively constrains navigation choices under magnetic storm pressure, culminating in the final image where "folded secrets" charge the maze's transformation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: storm-induced magnetic chaos narrows options to intuition vs shouting, with Marcus's crew disintegration showing visceral cost that reweights the dominant stake by the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through Elias's map-folded routes and whispered guidance; the final line reweights "whispers travel farther" as lived truth without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rhythms of footsteps revealing identities") persists under storm pressure; rhythmic control falters slightly in the challenge setup with near-uniform sentence openings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "serpentine route glowing faintly" introduces a minor figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat, preventing 8.8+ despite strong propulsion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of geomagnetic physics with navigation intuition feels inevitable; risk-taking (zodiac coin as decision tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry, scoring the Q8 9+ bonus.</comment>
