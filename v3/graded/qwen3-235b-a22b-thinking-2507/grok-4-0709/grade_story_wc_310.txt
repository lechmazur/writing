<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in cosmic-scale doubt; micro-choices like coin-casting reveal hierarchy of values. "Quietly enthusiastic" trait lacks sufficient contradiction under peak pressure—trembling hands don't fully challenge resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "stars will doubt but return" crystallizes transformed doubt amid observatory's tremor. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through static-burst distillation density, but cost legibility in final image is borderline subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Amber deck constrains choices (crystalline arrays pierce singularity) and charges closure; coins function as active tools. "Metallic whispers of forgotten empires" exemplifies tactile specificity that alters distillation tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (rebirth vs. eternal night) tighten through Elara's agency in distilling static bursts. Escalation via deepening knowledge ("purpose woven into cycle") reweights options, but cost—transformed doubt—feels slightly abstract despite observatory's tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: doubt fuels prophecy, not stated morals. Final line reweights "stellar doubt" into hope without resolution, offering resonant non-literal answer to rebirth question through charged silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phantom glows," "crystalline fractals") modulates under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off. Slight register drift in "wavelength align" phrasing risks clinical tone during high-stakes distillation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion. "Galaxies folded inward like crumpled parchment" risks slight overwriting in opening beat, but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line's cadence shift elevates closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic rebirth mythos via backwards prophecy mechanic. Risk-taking heightens stakes (doubt as fuel) without gimmickry; "ambered observatory" specificity transforms tropes through character-bound constraints.</comment>
