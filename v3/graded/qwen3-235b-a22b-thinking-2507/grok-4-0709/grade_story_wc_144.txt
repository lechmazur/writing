<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s blindness-as-strength, but Mira’s urgency lacks embodied tension beyond dialogue; "synthetic hum irregular and pleading" risks diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (Elias’s enduring blindness enabling others’ sight), yet the Accumulative lens ambiguity precludes 9.0 despite resonant refraction payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog and water features actively constrain repair methods—refraction diagnostics charge the final drone lift; mist’s tactile role in sound propagation elevates micro-setting to necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s auditory mapping under time pressure, but the "anchor lifts at dawn" clock lacks tangible mid-scene tradeoffs; cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from refraction-as-repair metaphor, yet "mending what was broken" edges toward abstraction; final image avoids moralizing but needs sharper ambiguity in Elias’s sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"fingers read the world like braille," water’s "refrain" guides repair; voice modulates flawlessly from calm diagnosis to resonant closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" repeats as template cadence (3x), dulling propulsion; otherwise crystalline prose—"iridescent wings crumpled" shows textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blind artisan repairing drones via sound refraction transforms tropes through specific mechanics; risk in sensory substitution pays off, but rail depot setting lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
