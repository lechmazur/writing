<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation for bartering destiny is clear and consistent, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the ritual; "fiercely gentle" trait enables compassion toward the Keeper yet isn't tested under tangible cost pressure during the pivotal trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("inherit a shadow of his torment"), but the felt weight of this cost remains abstract in the final image; Elara's "victory" dilutes the torment's immediacy despite the Keeper's warning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting: roots/bones constrain choice (tarot card pressed against ribcage-embedded trunk) and charge the final image ("roots and bones now guardians of the trade"), with sensory details woven through action like fungal light responding to embedded meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency as she presents the tarot card, but the inherited torment cost feels narratively distant; the Keeper's "price is steep" warning lacks concrete escalation pressure during the ritual's execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the burned tarot card's reweighted meaning—sacrifice as woven restoration—not moralizing; the final image of roots/bones as "guardians of the trade" offers resonant, non-literal answer to destiny-bartering's cost without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara's symbolic framing ("inlaying meaning everywhere"), but the Keeper's dialogue ("Destinies are not freely given") verges on thematic echo, slightly disrupting voice consistency under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beats: "half-lit corridors" repeats 4× with diminishing returns, and "dusky resolve" phrasing risks scaffold; near-closure line ("fiercely gentle in her victory") slightly overwrites the inherited torment's weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms destiny-bartering trope through visceral catacomb logic (roots snaking through bones as trellis), but "burned tarot card" leans familiar; specificity of fungal light responding to embedded meaning elevates emotional truth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
