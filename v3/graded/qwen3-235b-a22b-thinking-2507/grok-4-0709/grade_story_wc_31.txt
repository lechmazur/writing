<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (measured breaths, racing heart) and micro-choices (setting pole down), but motivation lacks deeper contradiction beyond singular quest. Epiphany feels earned through sensory buildup yet borders on convenient revelation without sufficient prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: Elias's irrevocable synesthetic shift ("lit them with new eyes") crystallizes under Accumulative lens. Sky lanterns' "collective sigh" reweights the opening hush, making cost legible when "colors unfurled in his mind—amber, emerald, sapphire."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water and library constrain choices (muffled noise forcing tactile search, air pocket enabling discovery) while the key tag charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy shines—"blue crash of waves" filtered through Elias's synesthetic bias—but "sodden manuscripts" detail slightly ornamental without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency (swimming, deliberate search) under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens as lantern glow activates the tag. Cost is unmistakable: his perception is forever altered, crystallized when "truth no longer hiding, but illuminating his world" after the tag's hum rewires reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects (tag's "plain appearance" hiding power) not moralizing. Final image of lamps lit "with new eyes" reweights the opening pier scene non-literally, but "truth no longer hiding" risks slight thematic echo despite earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("golden hum of lamps") modulates rhythm under pressure—shorter sentences during swim, lyrical flow in library. "Velvet hush" opening slightly clichéd but consistent; no head-hopping as single-POV voice stays anchored in synesthetic bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor figurative density in opening ("silent meteors in reverse" redundant with "fragile orbs") slightly dulls propulsion. Zero scaffold loops, but "meteor hush" repetition borders on overwriting; final line avoids thematic echo through concrete action ("lit them with new eyes").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia quest via physical "luminous vows," but premise not radically new. Sunken library setting transforms trope through tactile specificity (warped shelves, silt-buried hull), though "color of sound" motivation lacks emotional novelty beyond sensory wonder.</comment>
