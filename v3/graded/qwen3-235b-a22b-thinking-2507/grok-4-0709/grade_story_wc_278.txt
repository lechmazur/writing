<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in guilt, but interiority leans on abstract labels ("dissonance of old guilt") rather than embodied contradiction. Final tattoo choice earns closure through causality, yet emotional progression lacks layered irrationality—guilt resolves too neatly without simultaneous fear/regret during the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation succeeds early with vivid lab anchors. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as time-folding density intensifies pressure toward Charged Poise closure ("time finally unfolded its grip"). But firmware activation lacks escalation—tethering follows instructions without narrowing options or raising stakes mid-scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber constrains choices (tethering ritual) and charges the final image as "eternal witness," fulfilling micro-setting gate. Lab’s crystal resonators actively enable cry translation, yet occupational details (tattoo tools) remain decorative rather than affecting decisions, missing full 9+ integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("hush dissonance of guilt") signaled early, with cry translation deepening knowledge. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara follows the scientist’s method rather than making trade-offs. Single meaningful deepening suffices for length, yet cost feels intellectualized over visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "meteor hush" evolving from setting to resolution, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights guilt’s transformation non-literally. Slight symbolic convenience in amber’s role risks thematic echo, but earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the tattoo ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via astronomical lexicon ("constellation tattooist," "star patterns") and sensory specificity. But peak stress moments lose texture—"tears streamed down" uses generic physicality. Single POV holds consistently, though internal voice slips into abstract self-awareness during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "dissonance of old guilt that clawed at her soul" suffers mixed metaphor. Template cadence in ritual description ("She pried... unveiling... watching...") slightly dulls immediacy. Closure prose achieves crystalline clarity ("amber’s insect as eternal witness"), avoiding final-third artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic abandonment tropes via sound-capture tech and guilt-as-dissonance metaphor. Amber-tether mechanic feels specific, though "laboratory of lost sounds" echoes existing speculative concepts. Risk-taking (time-folding) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, but premise transformation lacks full inevitability.</comment>
