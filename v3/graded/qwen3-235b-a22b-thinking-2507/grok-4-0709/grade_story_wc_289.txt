<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction in "keeper of secrets" role versus yearning, but emotional progression lacks embodied friction during key pressure moments; whimsy occasionally overrides credible struggle in the installation sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (Elias handing Mira his scroll), but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—the installation setup faces no tangible opposition under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the lily pond’s surface actively constrains choices (arranging lanterns on pads) and charges the final image with "refracted light" binding all, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (emotional isolation) tightens through Elias’s agency in creating the installation; cost is visceral when he shares his own words, though the pressure arc lacks one tangible complication before Mira’s arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the thread metaphor and collective lanterns; avoids moralizing, but "universal thread" edges toward abstraction in the final line, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prismatic quiet," "thrush’s nest twig spiral") shines, though one elevated phrase ("binding him to the hidden threads") briefly drifts from Elias’s plausible lexicon during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "rainbows fracturing in droplets" exemplifying textural specificity. One borderline purple phrase ("serene shadow") prevents 9.0 but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghostwriter trope through concrete details (thrush nest spiral, collective lanterns), but avoids high-risk structural choices; emotional specificity elevates without revolutionary ingenuity.</comment>
