<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "vulnerability yet protected by night's embrace," but motivation lacks friction—no hesitation about continuing ritual despite rose's death, missing deeper conflict with "wistfully pragmatic" trait during pivotal adjustment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost ("bare rosebush" symbolizing loss vs. harbor's renewed glimmers), but lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural pressure ("quivering hush deepened") muddied by causal hints ("after final petal dropped"), weakening escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor setting actively constrains choices—moonlight dictates prism adjustments, water's chill affects action—and charges closure via rosebush/harbor duality; tool (gauge tooth) shapes tactics with "notched edge" precision during critical beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: rose's death triggers ritual, "quivering hush" deepens pressure during adjustments, and vulnerability cost is felt on water; but predators remain abstract, reducing visceral escalation impact despite solid causal chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "protected vulnerability" motif, culminating in resonant final image (bare rose/harbor glimmers) without moralizing; nearly flawless, but "purpose could endure" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient friction in the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "quivering hush" and oar rhythms, with stress-appropriate compression during prism work; minor scaffold in repeated "wistfully pragmatic" label slightly dilutes voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("oars resting like patient sentinels" conveys image/tone/character), and clean propulsion; "heart a haven" risks sentimentality but redeemed by concrete prior execution, avoiding closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fire escape gardener + harbor ecology, with gauge tooth transforming locksmith legacy into ecological tool; but bioluminescent creatures feel familiar, lacking transformative specificity to push beyond strong execution.</comment>
