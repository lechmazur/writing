<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident (isolation vs. need for connection), embodied through culinary metaphors, but climax lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during subsumption; "chef's intuition" slightly over-smooths the struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (physical/emotional toll of subsuming remorse), causal chain holds under Accumulative lens via tidal pool method, though "dream's haze lending unnatural strength" slightly undermines causality at dig climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tidal pools function as micro-setting constraining choice (guiding dig location), coral pavilion charges final image with bioluminescent veins, but occupational details remain metaphorical rather than tactically constraining actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting remorse) tightens through Elias' agency in tidal pool analysis and orb subsumption; cost legible in trembling pavilion and dissolved "bitter spikes," though resolution via "chef's intuition" risks convenience under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (tasting memories as broth refinement), final image reweights "sturdy brittle" motif without moralizing; "sandpaper" metaphor evolves organically but "alchemy" phrasing flirts with abstraction near climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bitter remorse like overripe fruit") with rhythmic control under stress; minor register drift during subsumption ("chef's intuition" slightly disrupts voice consistency in peak beat).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density but climax overloads metaphors ("waves of sorrow flooded him... complex broth needing refinement"), diluting immediacy; no loops, yet "sanded smooth"/"rough edges" repetition in final paragraph creates subtle scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of culinary skill with emotional contagion transforms regret-repository trope; "coral icebound pavilion" specificity avoids cliché, though redemption arc structure remains conventional despite strong execution.</comment>
