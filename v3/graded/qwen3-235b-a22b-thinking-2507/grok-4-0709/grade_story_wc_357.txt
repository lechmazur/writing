<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear (save orchard) but interior contradiction absent; "resilience" label replaces embodied struggle. Final choice lacks visible cost—wilted grove mentioned early but closure shows no earned sacrifice beyond retrieval.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis (arrow secured for renewal), but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence/image concretizing loss. "Wilted grove" isn't reweighted; gravity normalization feels like reset, not paid price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid setting anchors early (floating arches, gravity inversion), yet micro-setting misses 9+ gate: arrow tip doesn't constrain choices (e.g., no struggle to pry it free), and final image lacks tool/environment charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (save orchard) escalate via inversion pressure, but cost legibility falters. Water-flow navigation tightens options, yet gravity normalization erases immediate peril—felt price (family's ruin) remains abstract, not dramatized in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through echoes' growth attribute, but final image ("promised renewal") states hope without reweighting prior struggle. Lacks non-literal answer; avoids ambiguity with tidy salvation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (pilot's focus on flows/arches), but "whirling silence" refrain becomes rhythmic scaffold. Psychic distance shifts during echo visions lack modulation under stress—static awe dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until grotto: "crimson bubbles" fruit simile works, but echo descriptions ("translucent wisps") verge on purple prose. Template cadence in inversion sequence ("water droplets swirled... paths revealing...") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gravity inversion + ecological quest, yet derivative in "chosen one" relic trope. Risk-taking (inverted navigation) heightens stakes, but echoes feel like convenient lore exposition rather than organic transformation.</comment>
