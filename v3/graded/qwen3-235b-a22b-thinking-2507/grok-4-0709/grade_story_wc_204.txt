<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction lacks embodied micro-choices; Elias's realization of "double edge" feels conceptual rather than visceral cost. No simultaneous contradictory impulses during rupture climax weakens causality for Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (fragility exposed), but "sealing bottle anew" lacks visible trade-off to sharpen Earned Stasis. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through frost patterns to rupture, though causal linkage to compression feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choice (frost on leaves guides Elias's method) and charges final image ("frost patterned the glass once more"). Micro-setting triumph: letterpress tools alter tactics during rupture, though cloud-sea remains postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compressing eternity) tightens meaningfully via frost mandala discovery, but pressure lacks antagonist counter-pressure; rupture escalates stakes yet Elias faces no adaptation cycle. Conceptual cost (exposed fragility) is unmistakable but not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rustling awakenings" as both literal sound and metaphor, with final image ("eternity... rustled eternally within him") offering non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, but bottled whisper's thematic role leans slightly symbolic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost etchings, delicate as spider silk") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early via "thoughts could barter with physics". Minor register drift in "latent energy" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but "rustling awakenings" appears 4x with near-synonym churn ("stirrings," "stirred," "stirring"). No closure muddle, yet paraphrase loop in paragraph 5 ("awakening echoes... rustle like leaves") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through negotiable reality premise; "bottled whisper" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes, but "glass orchard" edges toward familiar surrealism without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
