<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bleak exhilaration") embodied through micro-choices like trembling fingers prying the yoyo; final renunciation of certainty earned by workshop precision. Minor abstraction in "unfulfilled longing" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "wondered if this victory was merely another illusion" crystallizes irreversible cost (doubt etched in reality) under Causal lens. Orientation perfect by line 1; tide's nadir tightens options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse gear mechanism constrains Elias's final action (looping string), and hunger stone's warning charges closure. Tide functions as live clock tightening decisions; no generic postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes materialize viscerally through yoyo's disassembly; Elias's agency drives escalation (unwinding string → syncing clocks → channeling stone). Conceptual cost ("illusion") unmistakable in final image under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "latent radiance" shifting from puzzle to dangerous hope; final image ("warning etched forever") reweights "bleak exhilaration" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct clockmaker voice ("neatly inventive," "dissonant harmony") with rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance tightens during activation ("heart pounded"). No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("barnacle-crusted rocks," "subdued, ethereal shimmer"). Figurative language ("weary breath") serves character voice without muddle. Final image avoids purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-reversal trope through hunger stone's famine-marker origin and "bleak exhilaration" tone. Emotional specificity in "void of his losses" avoids generic grief; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
