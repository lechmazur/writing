<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority powerfully concrete through geode and sensor adjustments, but contradictory impulses under pressure lack sufficient friction; grief-obsession dominates without countervailing urges that alter tactics during the hunt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "vow to draw renewal," but cost remains conceptual rather than legible in the final image; the observatory's shuddering establishes pressure yet lacks direct connection to Amir's physical or emotional forfeiture at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating observatory functions as vital micro-setting: winds battering floats concretely constrain Amir's actions during the climax, and the geode's refraction directly charges the final image by manifesting his bride's face in the data.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten effectively through Amir's escalating hunt toward the homeland pool, yet the cost of his obsession—beyond abstract sorrow—fails to visibly alter his tactics or manifest as a tangible price paid in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the geode's transformation from wedding rubble to conduit for "unused potential," avoiding moralizing; however, the final vow for "renewal" slightly overstates the non-literal answer to loss, risking sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in physicist-specific observations ("fractals of atmospheric data swirling like ghosts"), though minor register drift occurs when abstract concepts like "intangibly tangible" momentarily override character-particular diction during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters in the climax with repetitive "intangibly tangible" phrasing and slight overwriting ("pools weren't mere energy; they represented what could have been"), diluting momentum without pattern-teaching payoff in the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quantum physics and grief avoids cliché through specific details like perturbation theory applied to sensor arrays, though the "unused potential pools" concept edges toward abstraction without sufficient grounding in visceral consequence.</comment>
