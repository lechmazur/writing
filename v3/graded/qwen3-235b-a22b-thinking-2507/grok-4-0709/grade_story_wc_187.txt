<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("preemptively nostalgic" stated but not embodied); micro-choice of quill-dipping reveals value hierarchy yet lacks contradictory impulses in crisis. Diagnostic label usage triggers anti-pattern penalty without sufficient physical anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Orientation fails past 120 words (identity/location vague), capping momentum; closure achieves Charged Poise but cost remains conceptual rather than felt on-page. Non-closure accumulation penalties for orientation debt and weak cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choices (rainwater ink necessity) and charges final image; observatory's cloud perch creates tangible isolation pressure. Micro-setting as environment elevates to 9+ band through tool-specific causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; storm intensifies coincidentally rather than through her choices. Visible price absent despite "pang" mentions—cost remains abstract, failing band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (shadow measurements → identity sculpting); final quill image reweights "preemptive nostalgia" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while achieving non-literal resolution through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lightning veined the sky like fractured memories") shines, but filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("she felt the pang... urging her") contaminate voice. Rhythmic control compensates partially.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("preemptively nostalgic" variants) and slight overwriting in atmospheric beats. No closure artifacts, but synonym churn in middle section triggers -0.4 penalty under tightened Q7 rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "solid fog" physics and shadow-conjecture method transforms archivist trope; "preemptive nostalgia" concept risks prompt-derived abstraction. Derivative premise guardrail applies for underdeveloped emotional specificity.</comment>
