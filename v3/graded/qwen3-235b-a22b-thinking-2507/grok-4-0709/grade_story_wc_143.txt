<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; "dawnlit melancholy" stated as label rather than embodied through specific physical tradeoffs. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond generic sorrow, weakening Earned Stasis. Diagnostic label-speak in climax triggers -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost ("weight of what she'd outlasted"). Lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.4) for delayed pattern-teaching of chemical messages. Cost proof solid in final descent imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moonlit summit functions as micro-setting: frost-kissed rocks and lunar gravel constrain endurance tactics. Vial's chemical reactions charge final image through evolving light patterns. Missing constraint on choices (e.g., cold doesn't alter camera handling) blocks 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving fading hush) signaled early; escalation via timed messages deepens resolve under Accumulative lens. But "outlast" action lacks protagonist-driven agency—the pre-programmed chemicals drive escalation, not Elena's choices. Cost legible but not earned through her decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grain's dissolution, but "dawnlit melancholy" in final paragraph functions as thematic echo (-0.6 penalty). Final image ("remind others... urge to cherish") edges toward moralizing, weakening organic resonance despite strong particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("craters like forgotten wounds") shines, but "dawnlit melancholy" as repeated label violates subtext rule. Final paragraph's diagnostic phrasing disrupts voice consistency under pressure, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Melancholy tugged at her heart" embodies generic cliché; "solitary guardian" in closure beat dulls final image. Minor scaffold in reflection blocks (e.g., "her purposefully curious mind wandered") incur -0.5 artifact penalty touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space-age inspection with ancient vigil myth avoids derivative tropes through chemical message innovation. Emotional truth in mourning quiet moments elevates premise, though "dawnlit melancholy" phrasing slightly clichés the risk.</comment>
