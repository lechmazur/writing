<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "navigate without moving" tension; embodied emotion in weathered skin/eyes avoids labels. Slight therapy-speak ("deeper unrest") in peak motivation beats costs 0.3.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "hope stirred beneath the dust" crystallizes centuries of failure. Accumulative lens holds through bird-pattern escalation; orientation anchors by word 15 ("canyon of endless echoes").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting charging closure—shifting "softly" around skimmer then "stirring" with hope. Bone towers constrain movement (dust-swirl danger) and echo-amplification directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through stillness-as-agency: physical pursuit impossibility forces perceptual navigation. Cost legible in "centuries of layered dust" shifting as testament to patience paid for clarity. Pulse's erratic throbs escalate pressure texturally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust motif’s reweighting: from "chronicled slow march of time" to "hope stirred beneath." Final image ("stillness could conquer wandering") answers central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "harmonics that resonated through bone towers" and "wings like shards of night." Rhythmic control under pressure via cadence shifts (long sentences for contemplation, staccato for pulse effects).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "existence a testament to historically reverent traditions" (synonym churn). Otherwise high density: "faint smile cracking his weathered face" charges closure without muddle. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian trope" via harmonic stone-skimming specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes—pulse tracked through bird patterns feels inevitable. Avoids generic "chosen one" safety with flawed, weathered resolve.</comment>
