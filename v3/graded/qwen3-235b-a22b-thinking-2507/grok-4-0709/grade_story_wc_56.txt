<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "lies evolved, adapting to the seeker’s gaze" realization, but marriage backstory remains told not shown, lacking micro-choice during dive scene that would demonstrate simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: sundial reset crystallizes "time moves forward, but wisdom looks back" with felt cost of shattered life philosophy. Accumulative lens holds through density of perception without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Twilight canal setting constrains choices (diving harness use, silt navigation) and charges final image ("barge drifting silently"), though "thoughtfully clear" descriptor lacks physical consequence beyond mood mirroring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s agency: salvaging chest triggers the forgery realization that reweights his life’s work. Cost crystallizes in "lies weren’t just built; they evolved," altering his path with visible emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sundial’s reweighted meaning and forgery twist, but final line "Salvage complete, instincts affirmed" verges on thematic echo, nearly undermining the earned ambiguity of lies’ architecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "fireflies danced like errant thoughts" and pressure-driven syntax shifts during dive. No head-hopping, though "serene upheaval" repetition slightly dilutes rhythmic control under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters with "thoughtfully clear" repetition and static "serene upheaval" motif; minor paraphrase loop in "calm canal hid undercurrents of change / serene upheaval of dusk" slightly dulls closure’s conceptual charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-seeking with psychological insight through the forgery twist, though "antique pocket sundial" risks trope familiarity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
