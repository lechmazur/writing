<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied emotion ("secret burned in her chest") and micro-choices (hand brushing cloak) strengthen interiority, but guardian lacks contradictory impulses. Final confession earns cost, yet Elara's flaw (fear) isn't tested through simultaneous conflicting actions at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("I stole from her, but I'll make it right"), but Accumulative lens ambiguity persists past midpoint. Stillwater tension motif isn't fully charged at closure, slightly dulling the cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt dock functions as micro-setting: rain-slick planks enable mirror reflections that directly charge the final image ("illuminating the dock's cobalt hue with stellar brilliance"). Recurring object (dental mirror) constrains choices and reweights the betrayal stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by guardian's agency (weaving light patterns) under Accumulative lens reweights the dominant stake. Cost is unmistakable in Elara's whispered confession, with the dental mirror's mechanics creating a tangible trade-off between darkness and revealed light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image (stars mirroring light patterns) offers resonant answer to "darkness taught the value of stars" without moralizing. Theme emerges through the dental mirror's physical action rather than abstraction, avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("slick and reflective like a mirror to the overcast sky") shows rhythmic control under pressure, but filter verbs ("she felt") slightly dilute immediacy in high-tension beats. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" repetition (4x) creates minor synonym churn in high-pressure beats, slightly muddying momentum. Strong propulsion otherwise, but loop artifacts in the final third prevent 9+ eligibility per Text Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "wise mentor" trope through specific, grounded choices (dental mirror as teaching tool). Emotional truth avoids generic templates, but "stillwater tension" proximity to cliché limits risk distinction despite fresh light-weaving technique.</comment>
