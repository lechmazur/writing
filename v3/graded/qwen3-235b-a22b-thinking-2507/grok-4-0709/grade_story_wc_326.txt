<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alex’s heartbeat counting embodies trauma with visceral specificity; his shift from frantic tally to calm acceptance shows contradictory impulses under pressure. Elara’s fragmented voice avoids therapy-speak but "failure is the forge" borders on thematic echo, slightly diluting earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Alex’s slowed heartbeat count crystallizes rebirth with felt cost ("survival was wisdom enough"). Accumulative lens holds—ink patterns’ density shift reweights stakes without causal breaks. No orientation debt; radio’s hum-to-companion evolution charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Opal dome’s refraction physically enables the ink ritual (light → patterns), while snow-muffled silence becomes the "midnight balm" charging closure. Porcelain shard’s warmth in the final image reweights fragility as strength, fulfilling 9+ micro-setting gate by constraining choices and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Alex’s agency: heartbeat panic → ink ritual → defragmentation. Cost is visceral in his slowed count and "tender lessons" realization. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via patterned density (static → glitches → coherent voice), though Elara’s wisdom risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s ephemeral patterns → digital healing, avoiding moralizing. Final shard warmth reweights "fragility of ambition" into strength without stating morals. Near-miss: "failure is the forge" edges toward thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph penalty by being Elara’s fragmented speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV voice blends scientific precision ("binary echoes") with lyrical texture ("haunting silence like a forgotten blanket"). Heartbeat cadence modulates under stress; no head-hopping. Ink’s "swirls, veins, and sigils" shows character-particular perception, fulfilling 9+ perceptual signature test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops but "ephemeral patterns" repeats adjacent lines, risking synonym churn. Final line’s "ready to face the world anew" skirts cliché yet gains freshness via shard warmth. High density overall, though "catastrophic end" slightly flattens Elara’s stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Digital ghost fused with ink ritual transforms clichés: opal light enables defrag, making analog/digital interplay feel inevitable. Death certificate premise gains freshness through heartbeat embodiment, but porcelain shard symbolism leans familiar despite strong closure integration.</comment>
