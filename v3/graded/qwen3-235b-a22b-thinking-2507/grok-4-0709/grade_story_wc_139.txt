<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in ink-testing scene where rigid ethics dissolve into clarity, but "burning need" phrasing edges toward abstraction. Final choice earned through prior causality with visible transformation cost as Alex closes the casket.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when digital signature "liquefies bureaucratic intransigence" with undeniable conceptual cost (alerts coming but math holds). Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds perfectly through midnight breach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (vintage ink pot) constrains choices by enabling the breach and charges the final image through "metaphorically sealing" digital action. Prep room's embalming tools actively pressure Alex's urgency with "gleaming as if dead might stir."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: "active waiting" deepens into algorithm decoding that narrows options to midnight's vulnerability window. Cost is legible in "alerts would come" yet "scales finally even" crystallizes conceptual trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image of closing casket offers resonant non-literal answer to "mathematics of fair trade" without moralizing. Theme emerges purely from concrete actions: ink dissolving rigid fears reweights Elena's asylum as equitable calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "deathly vitality" reframing funeral tropes. Rhythmic control peaks during breach: "fingers flew over keys... glancing at clock" compresses stress without syntax disruption. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "buzzing with hum of refrigeration units and faint electric pulse" achieves triple-duty density. Final line's "scales finally even" crystallizes closure without sentimentality. One hairline overwriting in "sly grin that charmed victims."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms funeral home trope through "deathly vitality" lens. Ink pot's magical realism serves concrete stakes (not decorative), with "mathematics of fair trade" avoiding abstraction via digital breach mechanics. Risk-taking heightens coherence.</comment>
