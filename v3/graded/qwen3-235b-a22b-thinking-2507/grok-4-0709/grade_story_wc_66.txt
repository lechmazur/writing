<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("teach dust to tell stories") is vividly rooted but lacks contradictory impulses; no visible struggle or cost in pivotal moments like the final broadcast weakens earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: dust’s glowing tableaux crystallize the cost of Elias’s quiet labor ("diligent hands finally resting"), with the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding through density escalation to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ember alcove constrains choice (radio tuning in mist) and charges closure ("world inhaled its first free breath"), though "thistled calm" repetition slightly dilutes sensory specificity in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency (broadcasts → dust learning), with felt cost in the alcove’s "heart steady in thistled calm" during pivotal moments, though external pressure remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: dust’s luminous retelling offers non-literal answer to "story famine," reweighting "hoarded tales" through concrete action without moralizing, elevating closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers stained with ink," "dust motes mimicked narratives") modulates rhythm effectively, though minor POV slippage in "listeners puzzled" slightly disrupts focalization control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion marred by repetitive scaffolding ("thistled calm" x4, "secretly luminous" x3) and template cadence in broadcast descriptions, dulling high-pressure beats without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dust as narrative medium feels inevitable; "pirate broadcast via song lyrics" transforms tropes through specific stakes, though "story famine" backstory risks slight abstraction.</comment>
