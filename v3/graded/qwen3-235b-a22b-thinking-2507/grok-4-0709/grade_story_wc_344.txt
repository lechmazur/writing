<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied through salt/snow sensory cues ("bittersweet and saline"), but lacks concrete contradiction during pivotal gear assembly; micro-choice of selecting central gear shows value hierarchy, yet transformation feels unearned without visible struggle against the mechanism's resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: uncapping releases visions that crystallize the rhythm with felt cost ("tears freezing on her cheeks"), but the resolution lacks struggle—gears turn "on their own" without earned tension, slightly diluting the stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Frozen library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (numbed fingers assembling gears on crystalline floor) and charges closure through "eternal chill" echoing the final "gentle ache," with mirrors multiplying the workshop into infinity to reweight the rhythm's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning repair rhythm) signaled early but pressure lacks escalation—no meaningful tightening as gears assemble too easily; cost ("driftwood nostalgia") is legible yet abstract, failing to viscerally narrow options despite strong accumulative deepening through sensory density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of repair through temporal rhythm emerges organically from gear teeth glinting and tide-pulsing incantations; final image ("driftwood nostalgia lingered... forever bright") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the "fractured skies" premise through conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in frost-vein tomes and sea-salt nostalgia; rhythmic control under pressure shines during uncap sequence ("breath caught," "trembled") with purposeful compression taught early and paid off in closure’s crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in apprenticeship memory ("drifted like weathered wood ashore—nights spent...") slightly dulls momentum, but zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final line’s "eternal chill" achieves high density without scaffold, though one synonym cycle ("hauntingly bright"/"spectral flames") limits 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith craft with lunar mechanics avoids tropes through specific gear runes and frozen library logic; "uncap" ritual feels inevitable in hindsight, but risks safety middle by resolving struggle too smoothly without heightened stakes during assembly.</comment>
