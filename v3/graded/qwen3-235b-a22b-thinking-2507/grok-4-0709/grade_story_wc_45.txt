<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "shrewdly innocent eyes" and forgiveness/skepticism tension, but diagnostic label "a cleft in certainty" triggers -0.6 penalty in peak beat; emotional resolution over-tidy despite strong embodied micro-choices like trembling fingers at the tooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with visceral cost (breath catching, trembling hands) under Accumulative lens, but Orientation Test fails: "hedge maze" anchor appears at word 75, past 120-word threshold, warranting -0.4 penalty despite functional disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Secret garden constrains choices via luminous moonflowers guiding path and nightshade's toxicity implied in ritual space; final image charged by "garden seemed to breathe," fulfilling 9+ gate requirement through environmental pressure on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density increase (memories flooding during maze navigation) under Accumulative lens, but pressure lacks visible cost until closure; "bone setting" ritual deepens meaning but doesn't sufficiently narrow options earlier per band guardrails for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "mistakes into constellations" metaphor evolving from bone-setting to star visions, but "innovated in her mind" risks thematic echo penalty; final image reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shrewdly innocent eyes" and selective sensory detail, but filter-verb stack ("she felt compelled," "she yearned") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats; register drift in "innovated" disrupts POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion ("pushed through concealed archway"), but "nostalgic visions... innovated" creates mixed metaphor; minor scaffold in "method her aunt... had taught her" avoids closure impact, staying within Q7 8.0+ band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope through bone-setting metaphor and specific grief, but "substitute body" device echoes recent folk horror trends; emotional truth elevates premise though safety-middle hedging in resolution limits boldness.</comment>
