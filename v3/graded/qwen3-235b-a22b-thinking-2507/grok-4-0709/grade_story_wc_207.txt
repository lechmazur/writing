<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("place where explanations fail") lacks contradictory impulses during climax; her seamless lagoon swim omits internal conflict. "Sensibly eccentric" remains label-only without visible tradeoffs, though embodied petrichor collection shows specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: her rebirth carries felt cost ("quiet resonance guiding her onward") under Accumulative lens. The three hinged awakenings provide sufficient deepening, with the compass's thrumming charging the final vial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limestone cliffs and lagoon constrain choices (rope/pack prep, water immersion) and charge closure via the essence vial. Bioluminescent fungi create unique pressure, though factory closure's spatial impact could tighten tactics more.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through psychometry visions narrowing options toward the lagoon swim. Agency is clear but escalation lacks protagonist-driven friction; the "resonant hush" deepens meaning yet feels more discovered than earned through choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "petrichor from earth's tears" and lagoon transcendence. Final image reweights "eccentricity as sensibility" without moralizing, though factory closure's thematic role lacks fuller integration with her transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vials clinking," "glistening like ancient bones") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "weightless" swim description slightly dulls pressure, but voice coherence anchors the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Sensibly, she had packed..." tells rather than shows preparation, creating scaffold. No fatal artifacts, but "cool water embracing her like an old friend" slightly overwrites the swim beat, diluting embodied sensation in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of petrichor collection with psychometry avoids cliché through specific tools (19th-century compass) and emotional truth. Risk-taking enhances stakes without gimmickry, though factory closure's thematic link needs sharper integration.</comment>
