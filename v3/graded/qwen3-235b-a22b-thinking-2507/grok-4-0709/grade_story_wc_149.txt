<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied contradiction (yearning for the veil’s embrace while tending the orchard) and micro-choices (pruning, channeling resonance) align with debt repayment. Flaws lack active struggle—his passivity avoids testing blind spots, missing the "inevitable mistakes" requirement for higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "endless night" and fogged glass delay anchoring who/where/when past 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (bead still, fields thawing), but ambiguity in the Accumulative lens early caps score despite strong cost ("sweet poison" draining Elias).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting capped at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty. Greenhouse details ("glowing apples," "winter-cracked fields") are vivid but ornamental—no constraint on choices (e.g., frost never impedes action). Micro-setting (bead) charges closure but fails the 9+ gate requiring environment to shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("debt calls me back"), pressure tightens via escalating visits sapping Elias’s strength under Accumulative lens. Agency is reactive (channeling resonance), not proactive, limiting escalation depth. Cost ("venom seeping into veins") is felt but lacks visible tradeoffs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "resonant awakenings" as karmic metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("souls entwined") offers non-literal resolution, but "mournful elation" label repetition risks abstraction. Strength: bead’s shift from dormant to still reweights debt concept without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical voice ("vines twisted like forgotten spells") has distinct perceptual signature (alchemist noticing botanical details). Penalized for "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats ("heart ached with mournful elation"), triggering -0.4 deduction per Q1 policy. No dialogue issues, but stress moments over-rely on abstract phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with rhythmic propulsion ("Elias pressed on, motivated by the debt’s pull"), but paraphrase loops ("ephemeral cameo" x4) and synonym churn ("fleeting as a dream’s edge," "ghosted away") trigger -0.3 deduction. No closure artifacts, but "cascade of resonant awakenings" lacks textural specificity in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tropes transformed via alchemical specificity (bead as resonance conduit), but "debt across lifetimes" lacks unique moral calculus. Emotional truth in Elias’s quiet endurance elevates it, yet ghost’s "venomous" aspect feels underdeveloped. Derivative Premise Guardrail caps score despite fresh orchard mechanics.</comment>
