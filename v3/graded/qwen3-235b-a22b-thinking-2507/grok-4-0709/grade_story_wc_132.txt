<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in panic vs curiosity during transformation, but "reluctant and unbidden" slightly over-articulates emotion; micro-choices like pocketing the leaf reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "hair turning to delicate tendrils" and "bark-like yet flexible" skin; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to surrender moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that actively roots her ("moss softening under her feet"), constraining choice and charging final image; linden leaf veins motif evolves from observation to fused palm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through single deepening where struggle fuels transformation, making surrender necessary; cost legible in irreversible physical change, though escalation leans slightly passive as storm acts upon her.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete labor ("reconstructing not just the trellis, but her very purpose") without moralizing; final image reweights "yielding" as wisdom via linden leaf fusion, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in botanical lexicon ("chlorophyll hues," "metamorphoses"); circuitous sincerity modulates voice under pressure without convergence, e.g., "learning to sway too" as metaphorical admission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Panic rose, but so did curiosity" creates minor paraphrase loop with following sentence in high-pressure beat; otherwise impeccable rhythm and zero figurative muddle despite dense imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms plant-human hybrid trope through nursery-specific details (linden studies, trellis reconstruction); risk-taking in embodied metamorphosis avoids gimmickry by grounding in scientific observation.</comment>
