<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in moon-polishing ritual ("feigned surrender—with a private ritual"), avoiding label-speak. Micro-choices like selecting specific marbles reveal values under pressure, though Thorne lacks sufficient on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: nightly marble-polishing rituals deepen pressure toward Charged Poise climax where blooming vines reconfigure luck's meaning. Cost is undeniable in "Thorne fled, his luck score shattered" amid "leaves whispered of coming wither".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden maze actively constrains choices (hidden paths enable secret interventions) and charges closure with "vines twined around him like old friends." Marbles function as micro-setting—polishing rituals directly alter tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: frost deadline forces escalation from nightly mending to public revelation. Cost is visible in Thorne's collapse and villagers' confusion, though secondary pressure from Thorne could deepen earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through marbles' evolution ("lies turned to truths through patient craft"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights premise: "garden's loyalty a quiet triumph" charges prior material without stated moral, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "hedges twisted like forgotten promises," focuses on textures (cracked marbles, withered skin). Rhythm modulates under pressure ("whispered of withering" vs "burst with improbable blossoms") with zero POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "skin like dried bark, hands gnarled from years of tending vines that clung to trellises like desperate lovers" achieve high density. Minor abstraction in "whispered thanks for deception's birth" costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "mended deception" concept transforms through marbles' physicality. Emotional truth in "commemorating small victories elaborately" avoids tropes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
