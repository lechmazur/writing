<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weakens climax—trembling hands resolve to "strange peace" without sufficient struggle escalation; motivation clear but flawed execution in pivotal realization beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("lingering in memory defying demolition"), but fractal recursion's pressure lacks causal tightening—epiphany feels slightly passive rather than protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tree library setting vividly anchors atmosphere ("spiraling shelves carved into wood"), but fails 9+ gate—inner wall canvas doesn't constrain choices; micro-setting (coin) charges closure yet environment remains decorative backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via fractal density ("where did one layer end?"), but pressure feels externally imposed by coin rather than protagonist agency; cost legible yet tightening lacks organic protagonist struggle against recursion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through fractal metaphor—"pushing against edges only to find them unyielding" reweights premise without moralizing; final coin-sealing image crystallizes conceptual cost of human limitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mathematical poetry of surface" through face-blind eyes), but "heightened stillness" repetition near climax creates subtle rhythm loop; voice modulates beautifully under pressure otherwise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" recurs twice within 3 lines (loop penalty); otherwise impeccable propulsion—final line ("sealing it as the stillness broke") achieves resonant closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face blindness + fractals avoids gimmickry; risk-taking (quiet closure on acceptance) heightens emotional truth. Slightly safe in demolishment trope execution despite strong core.</comment>
