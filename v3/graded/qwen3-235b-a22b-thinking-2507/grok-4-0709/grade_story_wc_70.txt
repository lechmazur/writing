<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thorne's involuntary truthfulness drives key reveals with cost (withholding wonder would betray purpose), but Elara lacks contradictory impulses; her final choice lacks visible personal sacrifice despite systemic stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: city lights reigniting charges "enduring awe" with felt cost ("weight of blackout's despair"), though escalation remains linear without narrowing options or personal trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lacquer box's "solidified honey" texture charges the final image, but the tower setting functions as backdrop rather than constraining Elara's ascent—spatial details don't alter tactics during her climb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring wonder) tightens via the riddle, but resolution lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs; the blackout's systemic cost ("despair") isn't embodied in Elara's choices with personal forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the box's tangible "wonder" and Thorne's quiet purpose, avoiding moralizing; final line ("routine resumed—but now laced with enduring awe") reweights the premise without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("honeyed light," "trapped firefly") persists under pressure; sentence rhythm modulates perfectly from ominous ("whispers of panic") to resonant ("stars pricked the honeyed sky").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bio-luminescent drones, their wings sparking" compresses tech/emotion without muddle. Final semicolon creates crystalline cadence shift that recharges the nectar motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Drone beehive" transforms eco-tech tropes via nectar/lightning fusion; truthfulness attribute avoids cliché by forcing Thorne's risky reveal. Fresh inflection: wonder as tangible energy stored in lacquer.</comment>
