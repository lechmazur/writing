<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; "warmly curious" trait stated not shown creating tradeoffs during gnomon discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost (exile's spiritual theft), but lens ambiguity past midpoint weakens escalation; "roots twitching" moment lacks causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard’s bone-entwined roots brilliantly charge final image, but environment doesn’t constrain early choices until coffin excavation; micro-setting gate met late.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (faith restoration) tightens through discoveries, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven resistance; gnomon find feels fortuitous not earned through struggle against orchard’s peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Faith blooming like trees amid bones" reweights interrupted journeys theme without moralizing, though "whispers from dreams" backstory slightly undermines earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sweet rot mingling with decay") and rhythmic control under pressure, but "warmly curious" repetition creates minor register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with vivid specificity, but paraphrase loops ("purposeful wandering" x4) and template cadence in reflection paragraphs dull closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh catacomb orchard synthesis elevates diaspora trope, but sundial-as-faith metaphor lacks transformative risk; emotional specificity prevents genericness.</comment>
