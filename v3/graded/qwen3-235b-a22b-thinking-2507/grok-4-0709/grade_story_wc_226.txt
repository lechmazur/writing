<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "defiant resolve" vs "surrender innocence," but "innocently mischievous" becomes repetitive label without sufficient embodied cost escalation before the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"surrender innocence" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through refracted echoes intensifying pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and pale spire actively constrain choices: mist refracts poetry into visions, while "forged hush" modulates sensory perception during crisis, charging the final "free" whisper with environmental cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist’s poetic refracting—each stanza escalates cost ("surrender innocence"), narrowing options toward Earned Stasis. Ritual timeframe tightens emotional pressure but lacks concrete tactical impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from refracted echoes; "price is the self" avoids moralizing while final line reweights betrayal into liberation without abstraction. No thematic echo or forced binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bone towers clawing," mist as "lover’s breath") modulates under stress, but "refract a single truth" momentarily drifts into academic register during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "forged hush" repetition in opening paragraph slightly loops but pays off through textural deepening. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats like the mist visions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness tropes through echo-refraction mechanics. Specificity of "canyon of endless echoes" as emotional landscape feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
