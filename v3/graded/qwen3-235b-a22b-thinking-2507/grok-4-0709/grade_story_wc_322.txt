<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation for "texture of connection" is embodied through weaving micro-choices and contradictory impulses (calm method vs racing heart). Final renunciation of grief's "wild storms" for peaceful acceptance earns visible cost via spent sinew thread. Slight genericism in sister's dialogue ("I remember the garden") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost ("sinew thread spent," "peaceful acceptance"), but two distinct non-closure flaws: mechanical repetition of "as memories alter" refrains dulls escalation, and sister's emergence lacks prior tension buildup. Orientation anchors by 50 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gallery functions as active constraint: illusionary hooks hold thread only within optical deceptions, directly enabling Elias's method. Sinew thread as micro-setting charges final image ("texture... like sinew itself"). Visitors underutilized as atmospheric pressure, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (finding connection's texture) tightens through weaving density increases, with agency-driven escalation (each "memories alter" deepens illusion). Cost legible in spent thread and emotional shift to acceptance. "Cracks appeared" escalation slightly abrupt but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: final line ("connections weren't lost, merely rewoven") reweights sinew motif as conceptual repricing without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars (roses' scent, fibrous texture). "Rational enchantment" concept slightly underexploited in emotional logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hallucinations burned like illnesses yet followed strict logic of blueprints") with rhythmic control during eruption ("Threads bursting into luminous strands"). Minor register drift in "rationalizing the enchantment" slightly jars Elias's voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with concrete propulsion ("sinew thread, harvested from veins of forgotten beasts"), but paraphrase loops: "memories alter" refrain (3 identical phrases) and "realistically imaginary" overuse (4x) dull closure impact. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief mechanics with optical illusions; "rational enchantment" transforms trope through sinew physics. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Lost sister" premise slightly common but redeemed by specific weaving method.</comment>
