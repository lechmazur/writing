<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "staying while leaving" method; embodied empathy avoids labels except minor "keenly empathetic" slip. Final choice to remain hidden while offering anonymous note earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: midnight strike crystallizes stance where solitude becomes connection. Accumulative lens holds through density shift at "enlarging tranquility" that reweights betrayal's cost without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Secret library functions as micro-setting through nested paradoxes book triggering access, but fails 9+ gate—environment doesn't constrain choices beyond initial entry. Sensory details (paper scent, lantern light) effectively filter through Elias' calm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (unearthing wisdom from betrayal) tightens via clock pressure and betrayer's presence. Agency-driven deepening: Elias' choice to observe rather than confront narrows options, with cost legible in "hiding deeper by remaining still" as compassion overrides confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "nested path" realization reweights betrayal without moralizing. Final image of smoothed invitation in pocket offers resonant answer to central question—solitude as connection—avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "wrinkled relic" invitation and paper scent. Minor filter-verb stacks ("he felt an urge") in peak beats slightly dull immediacy, but rhythmic control during midnight strike sustains pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until "enlarged tranquility" repetition creates synonym loop in closure beat (paragraphs 14, 15, 17). Near-duplicate phrasing ("tranquility enlarging, expanding") risks scaffold, though final image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "reclusion as empathy forge" transforms tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—midnight gathering's paradox discussions deepen stakes organically without gimmickry, fulfilling 9+ quick test.</comment>
