<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("awkwardly confident") rather than embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost despite thematic resonance. Motivation clear but emotional progression feels tidied without irrational layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost (rebellion's rebirth), but cost isn't legible on-page—no sacrifice shown during reignition. Accumulative lens holds, though escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Spaceport setting vividly anchors atmosphere but functions as backdrop, not constraint; micro-setting (bare feet, opera glasses) doesn't alter choices. Final image charged by stone circle, but environment doesn't shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes (reigniting rebellion) signaled early but pressure grows through atmosphere, not protagonist agency. Stone circle activation feels coincidental; no trade-off or visible price paid despite thematic "cost."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image shifts ("lull as gathering storm"), with final vision reweighting stagnation without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; ambiguity lingers through concrete particulars like star alignments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("oil-stained ground," "skeletal guardians") with rhythmic control, but syntactic monotony in climax ("Elara...") and elevated diction clashes with POV during peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lush descriptions marred by scaffold loops ("thunderous serenity" repetition) and template cadence in paragraph 3. Near-closure filter-verb stack ("she understood... visions flooded") dulls immediacy without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rebellion exhaustion with lyrical stargazing, elevated by specific details (vintage opera glasses, stone hum). "Ancient artifact solves rebellion" trope slightly undercuts risk-taking despite emotional truth.</comment>
