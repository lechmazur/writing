<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion (trembling hands during assembly) but diagnostic "hypothesized" phrasing edges toward label-speak in peak beats; contradictions lack simultaneous tension during the hatching climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the hatched bird's iron-edged wings crystallizing the cost ("sweetness laced with bitterness"), though Accumulative lens isn't named until late, preventing 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended palace functions as micro-setting: its quakes directly constrain choices (shaking hands during assembly) and the "dust like falling stars" during climax charges the final image with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; the "bitterly sweet" tension is stated but not tested through Elandor's agency until the hatching, missing Band guardrail requirement for visible price altering tactics pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hatchling's metallic sheen reweighting "flawed genesis," but "bitterly sweet" repetition borders on thematic echo, preventing 9.0 despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystal spires quivering in perpetual quake" mirroring prince's state) and rhythmic compression under stress ("Bedraggled and worn") exemplify voice mastery; minor template cadence in middle sections.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops with "hypothesized" (7x in assembly sequence) dull immediacy, but final line's rhythm variation ("fragile, its sweetness laced...") avoids closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical apocalypse with lyrical rebirth (aurorafowl's iron filigree wings), though "bedraggled prince" archetype lacks distinctive traits to reach 9.0.</comment>
