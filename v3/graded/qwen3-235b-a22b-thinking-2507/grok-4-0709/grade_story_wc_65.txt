<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grounded data vs visionary hope) drive micro-choices; cost is felt in the quill-hovering tension but lacks concrete sacrifice beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with palpable cost in "weight of possibility," but conceptual cost isn't fully legible—missing a specific on-page consequence for failure beyond abstract stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain choices (e.g., reflecting light for calculations), but the kingfisher quill's iridescence doesn't actively shape tactics—charged final image nearly meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through predictive modeling details (wind shifts, underground springs), yet escalation lacks a visible price paid mid-scene; cost remains purely conceptual until closure's "weight of possibility."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "sustaining transformation" motif, but the phrase itself risks thematic echo; final image reweights constraint as potential without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("perpetual winter winds whispered secrets") and rhythmic control shine, though "groundedly imaginative" slightly disrupts voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but paraphrase loop ("transforming the immutable into a canvas for progress"/"mapping not just present but potential futures") dulls propulsion in a key beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and predictive modeling elevates trope, yet "ignorance cartographer" label feels slightly academic; specificity in hydroponic gardens on ice demonstrates emotional truth.</comment>
