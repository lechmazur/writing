<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in trauma response (enduring pain to seek mercy) is strong, but the final epiphany "forgiveness equaled pain divided by time" reads as diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost, undermining earned change. Proprioception trait lacks meaningful tradeoffs beyond description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: no visible price paid for resolution as she walks away "displaced no more" with symmetric formula. Strong early orientation anchors disorientation payoff, but accumulative lens collapses when trauma response yields tidy mathematical solution without sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>UV forest creates vivid micro-setting through proprioceptive lens ("moss that shimmered in hidden spectra"), but fails 9+ gate as environment never constrains choices—it remains atmospheric backdrop. Body-as-setting (hyper-sensitive nerves) charges climax but lacks tactical integration earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mathematics of mercy) escalates through trauma responses, yet resolution requires no meaningful trade-off—she computes forgiveness without enduring loss. The "warm calculus" soothes pain rather than charging it, violating band guardrail requiring visible price for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme develops organically through UV penance metaphor until final paragraph, where "forgiveness equaled pain divided by time" states thesis explicitly, triggering -0.7 thematic echo penalty. Conceptual repricing attempt collapses into pseudo-profundity rather than resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("symphony of awareness that bordered on agony"), but peak stress exhibits register drift into academic diction during climax ("algorithm," "variables of pain"). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt displaced," "she knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><grade>Opening lines achieve high density ("hum of invisible light"), but climax suffers text artifacts: mixed metaphors ("warm calculus") and template cadence ("she walked... ready to share") dull closure image. Figurative overload in trauma sequences reduces clarity despite strong early rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>UV penance concept shows fresh synthesis, but "mathematics of mercy" resolution feels derivative—emotional truth lost in symbolic convenience. Specific details (47-degree spine curve, pewter strap warmth) prevent safety-hedging, yet formulaic payoff lacks the non-obvious moral calculus required for 8.8+.</comment>
