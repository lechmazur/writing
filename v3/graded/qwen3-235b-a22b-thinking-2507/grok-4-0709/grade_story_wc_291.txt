<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between detachment and emergent empathy is embodied through micro-choices (ribbon analysis, studio breath control), but "dormant empathy" phrasing risks diagnostic label-speak; final portrait submission earns visible cost through family closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—quarry memorial’s "quiet peace" reconfigures mist’s oppression with felt cost of emotional awakening—but ribbon-to-ball leap lacks sufficient causal groundwork, slightly undermining Accumulative lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (obscuring quarry details, shaping final image); quarry’s "furrowed hush" evolves from oppressive silence to "quiet peace," charging closure through tactile specificity like condensation drips and ribbon texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (solving cold case while confronting empathy) tightens via Elias’s research-to-portrait escalation under Accumulative lens; cost of emotional vulnerability is visible in memorial scene, but "lancing core" resolution feels slightly convenient without prior tactical constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites emerges through concrete particulars (mask/grave, crimson/blood), with final image reweighting mist as "connections forged in shadow" without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in Elias’s earned empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Elias’s geometry-focused POV ("contours of forgotten stones," calipers as extension of self), but "lance the core" phrase disrupts voice with sudden violence; tense/stage consistency holds through emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control in quarry description, but "dormant empathy" and "awakened his own heart" verge on therapy-speak; repetitive "furrowed hush" phrasing creates minor scaffold loop in final beats, dulling closure’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Face-blind investigator transforms cold-case trope through specific methodological constraints (calipers, grids); emotional specificity in Elias’s isolation avoids generic templates, with ribbon fragment providing irreplaceable causal weight for the 1987 ball connection.</comment>
