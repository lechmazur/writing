<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (grief vs hope) embodied in cork-clutching micro-choice, but "screaming tenderness" label breaks POV during peak stress, triggering diagnostic-speak penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: Mira's emergence crystallizes the vibration premise with felt cost (years of grief transformed), though coincidence risks resolution without earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and vial cork function as micro-setting, constraining the ritual's physicality and charging the final image, but "cobalt" remains decorative rather than altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) tightens via dawn's arrival, but lacks visible trade-off; cost is prior grief rather than on-page price paid during the beckoning act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent ritual, but "whispers travel farther than shouts" is restated verbatim as thesis, and final moralizing ("whispers indeed traveled farther") triggers thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in maritime sensory details, though "screaming tenderness" phrasing violates Elias's plausible lexicon during high-pressure ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but "heart screaming tenderness" in climax uses therapy-speak label where embodied action was required, dulling closure image per Q7 penalty rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper trope with vibration motif, though midnight-bloom elixir edges toward derivative magical realism without sufficient grounding.</comment>
