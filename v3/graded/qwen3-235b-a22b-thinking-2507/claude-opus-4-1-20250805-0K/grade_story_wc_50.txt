<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory locksmith identity (fixer vs. documenter of brokenness) drives micro-choices like peripheral focus; final renunciation of repair is earned through weeks of study with visible conceptual cost in "documenting the precise shape of its escape."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: leaving the mechanism broken while accepting wonder leaks through cracks reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost in "wonder could be preserved not through capturing it, but through documenting the precise shape of its escape."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern's reflective surfaces (quartz veins, groundwater pool) actively constrain tactics—enabling the mirror-based study method—and charge the final image of the mechanism in its "marble cradle," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via intensifying temporal distortions (sound arriving before source) forces Mara's shift from repair to documentation; cost is crystallized when she adjusts the gear "not to fix it but to document its broken state perfectly," narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: documenting malfunction becomes the resonant answer to preserving wonder, avoiding moralizing via the final image of tomorrow's echo confirming her return—no stated moral, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light bent around it at different hours," "pre-echoes") with rhythmic control during pressure ("Sound began arriving before its source"); elision of direct mechanism study taught early and paid off through reflection angles.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crystal components still hummed with trapped light") propels momentum without figurative muddle, culminating in the crystalline final line where every word charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "broken time machine" trope through locksmith lens: documenting malfunction as preservation feels inevitable yet fresh, with emotional specificity in "wonder leaks through cracks in mechanical reason" heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
