<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (beautician/mortician) act in scene; final choice to capture "the moment between" is earned by her dual role with visible cost in becoming "flickering between states." No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise where "flickering between states" crystallizes options with undeniable cost—the grotto becoming a "cathedral of frozen aurora" while they endure in limbo. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to the chip's song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto functions as micro-setting: aurora’s movement hides Mira’s gestures, and the solidified-light table becomes the essential site for infusing the chip, directly charging the final image of "frozen aurora" cathedral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira’s agency under Accumulative lens: Silence’s rise forces faster work, narrowing options until the chip’s song creates the "bubble of potential." Cost is visceral in "felt it pulling at her feet" as stillness claims the grotto.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—the "radiant hush" final image reweights the central question without moralizing. The star’s suspended state ("not alive, not dead") embodies complexity, avoiding tidy binaries about beauty and death.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hands steady," "consciousness sharp as winter air") modulates rhythm under pressure—sentences tighten as Silence approaches. Purposeful compression (backstory in 3 lines) taught early and paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "patterns in static suddenly aligned" does triple duty (action, revelation, theme). Final line’s "radiant hush" recharges the motif with crystalline clarity—no figurative muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific synthesis: "beautician mortician" isn’t ornamental but essential to capturing the threshold. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—"eternal almostness" feels inevitable.</comment>
