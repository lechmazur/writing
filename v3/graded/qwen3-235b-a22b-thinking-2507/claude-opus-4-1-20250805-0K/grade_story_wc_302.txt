<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in "cautious exuberance" during documentation, with embodied tension between gloved hand clutching the watch and veil removal at climax. Micro-choices in timing observations reveal hierarchy of values, though emotional layering slightly lacks visceral physicality during time reversals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern recognition; closure lands as Charged Poise when library pulses recognition, with conceptual cost in "infinite potential of the pause." Orientation clear by line 3, and propagation delays create legitimate pressure narrowing options without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch constrains choices via shifting symbols and time manipulation, charging the final image when symbols align into words. Library's propagation delays function as micro-setting that directly shapes navigation tactics and the climax's transparency revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency in documenting delays, with visible cost in the conceptual shift from seeker to keeper. Escalation driven by her pattern recognition deepens the central conflict about unspoken words' power, though the librarian's appearance slightly eases pressure without sufficient complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete library mechanics: "propagation delays" become the resonant answer to "power in the pause" without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise through the library's transparency revealing other unspoken-word libraries, avoiding thematic echo despite the watch's explicit message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "symbols shifting when not looked at directly" and "delays following mathematical sequence" reflects the dreamer's analytical focus. Rhythmic control intensifies during documentation scenes, with purposeful elision of the confidence man's backstory taught early through parchment warnings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion in phrases like "consciousness folding through time like origami." Final line "waiting for the next veiled dreamer" recharges the opening mist imagery without muddying closure. Minor filter-verb use ("she understood") remains voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through "propagation delays" as breathing-space physics, with emotional specificity in documenting silence. Risk-taking in conceptualizing unspoken words as temporal phenomena feels inevitable through the watch's mechanics, avoiding derivative safety with "cyclically reversed" time as core driver.</comment>
