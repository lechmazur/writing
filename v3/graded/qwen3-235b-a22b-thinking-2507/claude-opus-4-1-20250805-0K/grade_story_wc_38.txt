<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied action ("feet carved patterns through water"), but contradictory impulses under pressure remain underdeveloped; final renunciation earned yet emotional cost feels slightly abstract despite spiral water image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("Welcome home" + spiral water holding shape) delivers undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation solid by para 1 with "knee-deep brackish water" crystallizing stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flooded lab actively constrains choice (water depth shaping dance) and charges final image (spiral water); micro-setting of dice/journal transforms from object to embodied constraint through tactile interactions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Maya's agency as dance density increases pressure; "calm defiance" concept reshapes tactics, but grandmother's identity reveal slightly late for optimal cost legibility at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "inherited motion" motif without moralizing; final line reweights premise with conceptual cost ("lyrical truth" vs. logical decryption), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("green-filtered sunlight danced across shoulders") with rhythmic control during dance sequence; minor register drift in "brackish" but redeemed by scholarly character context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high-density prose ("eddies mirrored spiral patterns") serves dual character/atmosphere roles; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like dice glow sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance-as-cipher-breaking avoids tropes through specific stakes (water resistance shaping movements); risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry, though "spider" metaphor slightly overused.</comment>
