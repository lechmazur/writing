<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction: Mara trusts instruments yet acts on instinct, embodied through stone vibrations and vanished cats. Final choice earned by grandmother’s wisdom, but emotional layering lacks sufficient irrationality (e.g., no self-deception about modern tools).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "walls of snow reshape the landscape" visualizes avoided catastrophe. Accumulative lens holds, but tectonic avalanche origin feels retroactively convenient (coincidence complicates pressure without sufficient groundwork).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary constrains choice: solstice hush enables bell’s reach, while bell rope’s texture ("hemp fibers rough") charges final image. Micro-setting excellence, though cloud-top "smooth as fresh snow" borders on visual cliché without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory deepening (vanished cats, stone vibrations), narrowing options to bell vs. switch. Agency drives closure, but tectonic cause slightly undermines pressure coherence—avalanche feels externally imposed rather than earned by Mara’s choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "ancient wisdom over modern certainty" crystallized in layered warning (bell + sirens). Final image of snow-chimed bells reweights solstice hush without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara’s storm-whispers focus shapes selective detail ("particular silence," "air drawing breath"). Voice modulates perfectly under stress, though one filter verb ("she could see") slightly dulls immediacy in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise ("pressure readings that made no sense"), but adjacent sentences restate calm ("unnatural calm," "crystalline and still") creating minor paraphrase loop. No closure-dulling artifacts, though density risks in sensory descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms storm-warning trope through solstice hush specificity and bell’s cultural weight. Emotional truth in Mara’s quiet expertise avoids generic heroism, though avalanche origin leans slightly derivative of disaster narratives.</comment>
