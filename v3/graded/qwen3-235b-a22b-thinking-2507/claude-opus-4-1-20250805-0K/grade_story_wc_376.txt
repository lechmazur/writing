<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (truth-teller's isolation vs. duty) manifests in embodied choices; final renunciation of peace earns cost through prior causality. No therapy-speak; micro-choices like rereading phrases under pressure reveal value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("peace dissolve like morning condensation") under causal lens. Every beat tightens options toward crystallized stance; orientation clear by 40 words. Cost proof: "dissolve like morning condensation on glass" crystallizes sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice (living leaves for communication, toxic sky forcing crystallized messages). Final image ("dead zones... where words went to wait") charges closure with environmental irony. Body/tool specificity (gold-tipped brush, sweating tunnel) essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Vera's agency: fragment discovery tightens to map interpretation, forcing truth-delivery trade-off. Cost ("peace dissolve") reweights options under causal lens. One tightening suffices; moral calculus between candor and societal collapse sharpens peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystallized messages and "truth like water" motif without moralizing. Final line reweights premise with conceptual cost ("dead zones... where words went to wait"), offering non-literal answer to truth's necessity. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices textures (dulled zinc, breathing leaves), senses lies physically. Rhythm modulates under pressure (sparse tunnel sentences vs. dense workshop descriptions). Zero head-hopping; voice consistent through emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("golden ink would refuse to flow" does triple duty). Figurative language ("condensation that smelled of copper and regret") avoids muddle. Final line's cadence shift ("worth wilting for") propels closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: greenhouse dystopia with crystallized sound and truth-sensing calligrapher. Emotional specificity avoids trope; "bitter honesty" grounds universals. Risk-taking (quiet Charged Poise closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed.</comment>
