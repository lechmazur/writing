<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (fighting historical erasure through resourcefulness) drives key choices with visible cost (leaders' arrest), but Jakob remains functional rather than fully realized. Contradictory impulses (youthful recklessness vs. scholarly precision) surface subtly in her lagoon reading, though emotional complexity lacks deeper layering under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the key catching sunlight crystallizes "freedom coded in spaces between stories" with undeniable conceptual cost (sacrificed leaders, shifting lagoon). Causal escalation holds—Ministry's imminent strike forces Mira's tunnel access—though the memorial transition lacks meaningful tightening beyond established momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The auric lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (dusk timing for reflections) and charges closure (gold-to-silver shift mirroring cost). Key's physicality ("teeth worn smooth") directly enables the tunnel access, making it indispensable to the final image where sunlight reweights its meaning from forgotten relic to proof of resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: Ministry's "within the hour" deadline forces Mira's race to Pier 47, narrowing options to uploading files before dawn. Visible cost (arrested leaders) alters tactics by providing distraction, though the resolution feels slightly frictionless given the scale of exposing global archives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—Mira's puddle-reading and document uploads—not abstraction. The final line ("freedom coded in spaces between official stories") resonates as earned CR without moralizing, reweighting the key's meaning through prior particulars (Pacific Bell's erasure, lagoon's star-maps).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature ("reading language of reflected light") creates distinct voice; syntax compresses under stress ("They're coming," whispered Jakob). Jakob's sparse dialogue carries subtext ("Reappear?"), though his characterization lacks the rhythmic specificity of Mira's internal texture during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "the lagoon shifted from gold to silver" simultaneously tracks time, charges cost, and mirrors theme. Figurative language ("starlight like scattered diamonds") serves pressure without muddle, though "carefully resourceful" slightly edges toward label in one mid-beat reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms historical revisionism through specific, grounded choices: auric lagoon's industrial spill backstory, Pacific Bell's tangible key. Emotional truth in Mira's quiet scholarship over rage avoids genre clichés, though the "underestimated rebel" archetype remains familiar despite fresh execution.</comment>
