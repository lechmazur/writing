<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "awkwardly confident" movements evolve into "ancient and sure" certainty under pressure. Final choice to bring others tomorrow earns closure through embodied realization—not abstract epiphany. No diagnostic labels mar the pivotal heartbeat metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: pressure builds via sensory density ("hum intensified," "tools resonated") to Charged Poise closure. Cost is visceral—"thunderous serenity" where chaos and calm coexist—and lands on "forgotten engine coughed to life," proving the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Repair bay’s micro-setting constrains choices: bare feet sense stone vibrations, twilight timing affects resonance. Final image ("engine coughed to life") charges closure through environmental cause/effect. Stones aren’t symbols—they literally alter tactics via harmonic physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is Kira’s agency-driven deepening: walking the circle transforms "lull" from exhaustion to strategic inhale. Cost crystallizes in "chaos and calm existing simultaneously"—a felt conceptual price where revolution’s weight becomes tangible, narrowing options to generational patience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: opera glasses revealing star maps reweights "rebellion stalled" into "song generations complete." Final image avoids moralizing by making stones’ hum the answer—resonant subtext where "lull was ending" reframes the entire struggle without a single abstract claim.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "toes gripping textured steel," "tingle in her soles" filter reality through barefoot immediacy. Rhythm modulates from fragmented tension ("Tonight felt different") to flowing certainty, with zero head-hopping despite single POV introspection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding—every line advances pressure or atmosphere. "Amber threads of day" to "stars seemed closer" shows progression without redundancy. Final line ("lull was ending") crystallizes tension through concrete action, avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion tropes via specific physics: revolution as harmonic resonance, not explosions. Fresh synthesis where "margin of daylight" timing and stone frequencies create organic stakes. Risk-taking (lyric pacing) heightens urgency without obscuring the engine’s literal cough to life.</comment>
