<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between urbane composure and revolutionary heart is shown through micro-choices (grinding ink while planning subversion), but the cost of the argument's fracture remains abstract rather than viscerally embodied in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Marcus smiles while preparing the backwards show, crystallizing his stance with conceptual cost in "the hush between ignition and impact," though the meteor hush metaphor slightly obscures the felt emotional price of the collaborators' departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radar dome's acoustic properties actively constrain storytelling choices (echoes refracting truths), while the story stick's notches charge the final image as Marcus uses it to "conduct an orchestra of shadows," perfectly fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus' realization that reversing narrative flow ("letting the ending reshape the beginning") forecloses collaboration, with the conceptual cost of fractured relationships felt in the "hush left behind," though escalation relies heavily on reflection rather than immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the story stick's evolving meaning and puppetry mechanics, avoiding moralizing, but the explicit internal question "How do you tell necessary truths without becoming another voice of violence?" risks thematic echo despite being dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in calligrapher-specific observations ("luminescent calligraphy," "ink-wash techniques"), with rhythmic control deepening under pressure as sentence fragments accumulate during meteor shower contemplation, teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but adjacent sentences "Marcus remained uncommonly serene... He'd learned long ago" create a minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 3, slightly dulling momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy and puppetry transforms the "subversive art" trope through specific mechanics (reversing narrative flow, shadows dissolving into calligraphic strokes), though the ethical storytelling premise risks familiarity without the radar dome's unique constraints.</comment>
