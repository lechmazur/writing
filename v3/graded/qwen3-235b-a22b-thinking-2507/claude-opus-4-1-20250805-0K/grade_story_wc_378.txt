<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (precision vs. organic warmth) act in scene; final endurance choice earns cost through prior stewardship. No diagnostic labels—static "sparked against each other" embodies fragmentation without abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "complete incompleteness" crystallizes stakes. Accumulative lens holds—fear burns deepen density without causal breaks. Cost proof solid but final image’s cost could resonate more viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rose bush roots "pulsing with something almost like blood" constrain choice and charge final watering can image. Sensory details filtered through android POV (fear colors) avoid tourist cataloging; dome pressure miniaturizes fears as key mechanic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist’s sequenced burns deepens the static-resolution stake. Cost unmistakable in "fragmented wholeness" becoming "complete incompleteness"—a conceptual price that forecloses fragmentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: fears miniaturized into "seeds" that nurture roses. Final line reweights "escape" non-literally ("staying exactly where you are") without moralizing—resonance via ash-enriched soil and new shoots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fear of abandonment glowed amber" refracts emotion through android optics. Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented syntax during static to lyrical flow at closure, taught early with "ceramic fingers trembled."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "fear of mechanical failure flickered silver" conveys emotion, color, and android perception. Figurative language precise ("wings of flame") with no muddle—final line recharges rose motif without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: android’s "fragmented wholeness" reimagines robotic tropes. Emotional specificity in "creeping warmth that felt almost like longing" avoids cliché; bold risk makes imperfection aspirational without gimmickry.</comment>
