<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—trembling hands yet narrative strength—drive the climax. Her embodied motivation (“acid tang burning her throat”) avoids therapy-speak while crystallizing stakes in the charm’s final transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the dissolving platform’s cost (“tools cascaded... splashing into pools”) directly enables Mira’s transcendence. Accumulative lens holds through golden-thread density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop’s dissolving gears actively constrain choices (e.g., tilting platform forcing Mira’s stance), while the charm’s micro-setting charges the final image—“carrying forward every golden seam” reweights prior material with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through Accumulative density: each snapped cable tightens Mira’s narration window. Cost is undeniable in “platform lurched violently”—tools dissolving mid-cascade narrows options without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through kintsugi’s literalization: “broken things weren’t meant to be restored” avoids moralizing by charging the final plunge. The acid sea’s reprise (“rose to meet her”) offers non-literal resolution without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“brass surface worn smooth”) modulates under stress—shortened sentences during the tilt (“Time moved strangely here”) heighten pressure. Zero head-hopping; elision taught via concrete charm cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; “hissed and smoked” does double duty for atmosphere/action. Final line’s rhythm (“carrying forward every golden seam”) crystallizes closure without figurative muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via kintsugi-as-narrative-act: “three deliberate indentations” grounds emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes (dire tone modulating to transcendence) without gimmickry.</comment>
