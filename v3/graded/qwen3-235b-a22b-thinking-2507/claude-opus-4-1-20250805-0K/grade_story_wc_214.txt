<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "spiritually curious" trait told not shown; synthetic skin/glitches imply embodied struggle yet vulnerability insight lacks causal friction before still star revelation. Micro-choice shift to handwritten notes earns change but interior contradiction feels retrospective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "vulnerability had become their telescope" crystallizes stance with felt cost in prior isolation. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks at still star’s fade, reweighting impermanence through lantern glass reprise. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass constrains choice (handwritten notes over computers) and charges final image; stellar dust lens shifts from tool to philosophical conduit. Body (synthetic skin scars) and tool integrate tightly but "Orion sector" lacks specificity to constrain action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (finding strength in vulnerability) tightens via still star’s defiance of motion, narrowing Kepler-9’s options to handwritten documentation. Cost legible in "every lonely night" preparing for revelation, but escalation relies on external phenomenon rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lantern glass reprise: "strength to simply be" answers central question without moralizing. Final image reweights "overlooked era" into sacred space via concrete action (polishing glass), avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "read the universe’s subtler languages" filters cosmos through janitorial intimacy. Rhythm modulates from measured grace to trembling urgency. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via "cosmic janitor" framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "whisper of cosmic radiation" exemplifies textural density. "Synthetic fingers trembled" avoids filter verbs. Slight register drift in "primal elegance" (Q9J) but redeemed by "scars on synthetic skin" specificity. Final line recharges lantern glass motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic janitor trope via vulnerability-as-strength synthesis; "star that found peace with impermanence" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes but "spiritually curious" label slightly generic. Authenticity anchors freshness.</comment>
