<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elena's interior contradiction—solitude versus connection—drives her pivotal choice. Her embodied micro-choices (decoding pigeon's condition, pressing flower petals) reveal character without labels. Final renunciation of passive observation for active resistance earns visible cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm patterns and pigeon details accumulate to crystallize her stance. Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost—"tranquility with layers" reconfigures solitude as resistance. Cost proof: "Each measurement... an act of resistance" charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Anemometer and journal petals function as micro-setting that constrain choices and charge closure. Wind speeds "sufficient for your purposes" directly shapes tactics; final calibration by lamplight ties tool to revolutionary act. Avoids generic description through weather-professional filtering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs. suppression) tightens when Elena realizes her data enables rebellion. Escalation driven by her agency: creating new stations and hidden caches. Cost is legible in the shift from "solitude" to "currents of revolution" within the final tranquility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: journal petals (beauty persisting), wind speeds (truth as weapon). Final image "nurturing integrity that would outlast any wall" reweights quarantine premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through earned subtext in coded reply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is meteorological precision ("amber light pooled," pressure gauge set down "carefully"). Under stress, syntax compresses: "She had been followed home six nights ago." Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical to poetic without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story. "Currents of revolution" avoids mixed metaphor while charging tranquility. Closure beat has perfect rhythmic control: "adjusting their calibrations by lamplight" propels into thematic resonance without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine trope through meteorological lens—storm patterns as revolutionary tool. Emotional specificity in quiet resolve ("I remain committed to accurate observation") avoids generic rebellion. Fresh inflection: flower petals pressed in data journal symbolize hope within rigor.</comment>
