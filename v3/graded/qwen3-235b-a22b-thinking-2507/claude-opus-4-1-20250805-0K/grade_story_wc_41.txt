<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is implied but not embodied; "strange sorrow of understanding" leans toward label over concrete action. Motivation clear but flaws don't compound choices—Ezra's passivity weakens causal stakes despite poignant closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: fog sculptures, static, and chalk wear deepen the dominant stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost—"profound weight of time moving through them both" crystallizes the tidal longing with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (chalk, TV static) constrains choices and charges the final image—"chalk grew smaller... wearing away like years" reweights time's erosion. Minor driftwood redundancy slightly dilutes sensory precision, but fog's dissolution actively pressures the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulation: magnetic decay and eroding chalk narrow options toward the voice discovery. Agency is collective (adjusting TVs), but the cost—degradation preserving memory—is felt, not shown as a live trade-off in tactics during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "clinging to echoes" manifests in degraded tapes and prophecies. Final image reweights time's passage without moralizing, though "forgetting was not a curse but a kindness" edges toward thematic echo, saved by being Ezra's earned realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "vapor forms dissolving like memories" filters fog through Ezra's amnesia. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical to clipped under pressure ("She nodded..."), though "ancient rhythm" slightly overwrites his POV in one phrase.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor scaffold: "Ezra understood... This was why" restates the same insight. "Degrading and preserving simultaneously" flirts with therapy-speak, yet the final chalk metaphor avoids overwriting through concrete wear. Propulsion remains taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "sound of time passing through a human body" transforms tropes via tactile decay (static, eroding chalk). Emotional specificity in the weeping discovery avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (amnesiac prophet) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
