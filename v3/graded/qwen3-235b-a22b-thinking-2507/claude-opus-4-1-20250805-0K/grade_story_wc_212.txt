<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (reopening sealed garden) is concrete through seed-touching actions, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "temporal drift" embodiment strong yet remains singularly focused on duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("power could unravel causality") under Accumulative lens; vortex stabilization → garden reform crystallizes options with felt stakes in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: subliming ice reveals "living wood beneath" that directly enables garden's return, charging the final image where oak panels "had been growing for a thousand years, waiting."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency as entropy-decreasing actions narrow options; conceptual cost ("unravel causality") is unmistakable when Mira grasps grandmother's sealing rationale amid temporal drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Dragon Tongue beans taught resilience" avoids moralizing; final oak image reweights "borrowed time" as "gifted" inheritance without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("seeds hummed with summers that never were"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("breathing steady as a metronome while her hands danced") with no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "texture of borrowed time was like velvet" tells rather than shows; minor synonym churn with "furiously tranquil" (3x) slightly dulls high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms seed-saving trope through temporal physics; "vortex inheritance" of compressed-time seeds feels fresh with emotional specificity in bean/watermelon lessons avoiding eco-parable clichés.</comment>
