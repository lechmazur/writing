<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's embodied contradictions shine (floating/anesthetic vs. phantom pains), but the child's agency feels slightly symbolic rather than fully individuated in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "why she'd survived" crystallizes with conceptual cost ("not to broker grand peace treaties... but for this"), fulfilling Accumulative lens through accumulated meaning in the cast's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and coral fragment constrain choices (decrypting prayers) and charge the final image—coral pressed into palm as "growing toward light" embodies the theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Maya's morphine-loosened honesty deepens the dominant stake (decoding hope), narrowing options to this intimate act; cost is legible in her "lotus-hearted ache" resolving into purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (writing "Old wounds grow new wings"), avoiding moralizing; the final "alphabets of healing" reweights loss into renewal without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ridge-matched scars," "smudged symbols") modulates with emotional intensity; Vietnamese veteran/Samoan nurse additions deepen texture without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lotus-hearted ache" risks therapy-speak but is immediately embodied ("throat tightened"); coral's dual symbolism ("neural pathways"/"endurance") avoids muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Risk-taking transforms translation from diplomatic tool to healing ritual; specificity ("Chamorro 'brave little warrior'") avoids generic trauma tropes, making emotional truth feel lived-in.</comment>
