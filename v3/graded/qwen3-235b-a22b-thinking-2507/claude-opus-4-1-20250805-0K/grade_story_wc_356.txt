<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels with embodied contradiction: ambition vs. patience manifests in micro-choices like sketching rhythms mirroring village sway. Final endurance (breathing through stench) forecloses haste with visceral cost. Slight backstory fragment weakens causality but doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Mira's swaying stillness amid bloom's stench crystallizes the wisdom undercurrent with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, though "tide's thought" vagueness slightly obscures the pressure point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Whisperwood village functions as essential micro-setting: its sway physically constrains Mira's choices (cultivating serenity while moving), and the corpse flower's stench charges the final image as transformative communication. Lightning-struck soil and spider-web dew directly alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (rush vs. patience) tighten through Mira's embodied learning—detecting soil pH, fungal threats—under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning haste for rooted stillness. "Tide's thought" phrasing slightly abstracts the escalation but doesn't undermine agency-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the corpse flower's odor reweighting decay as "communication, not death." Final journal image—sketching the flower's "true" essence as "patient teacher"—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Peer mockery subtly sharpens the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira's olfactory sensitivity shapes all description ("smell its readiness like thunder"). Rhythmic control mirrors her growth—early short sentences evolve into flowing cadences. "Olfactorily sensitive" slightly jars but is redeemed by embodied details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with zero scaffold: "dew collected from spider webs at dawn" compresses time, setting, and character trait. Final line ("rooted at last in understanding") recharges the sway motif perfectly. "Turning of tide's thought" slightly muddles clarity but fits lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: corpse flower's stench as wisdom communication transforms a horror trope. Treetop village's sway isn't backdrop but the core metaphor for embodied patience. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
