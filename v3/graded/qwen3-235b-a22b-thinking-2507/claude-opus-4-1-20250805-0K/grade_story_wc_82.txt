<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's contradictory impulses—preserving Lin's memory while transforming grief—act simultaneously in polishing scenes. Final choice to make lanterns from gems earns closure with visible cost: "thousandth crane of grief" crystallizes her endurance. No diagnostic labels; embodied torment in "luminous agony" avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: lanterns casting "dancing shadows like daughters" reconfigure grief with undeniable cost ("cannot rebuild what is lost"). Accumulative lens holds—gem collection tightens emotional pressure toward earned stasis. Cost proof: "craftiest hands" line crystallizes irreversible loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dream-gem as micro-setting constrains Mei's choices (polishing technique) and charges the final image (lanterns from gems). "Bridges of woven moonlight" and "glass basilica looming" create tactile pressure—environment shapes her grief-work physically and thematically, exceeding 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mei's agency: each polished gem deepens the dominant conflict (transform grief without erasure). The "unexpected" Lin-vision escalates pressure by reweighting loss as possibility, with felt cost in her "strange peace." Escalation driven solely by her labor under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "luminous torment" reframes as sustainable light. Final image answers central question without moralizing—"love reformed into light" reweights prior material. Avoids thematic echo; Master Shen's wisdom feels earned through Mei's work, not abstract sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glass/light motifs filter all observation ("colored glass threw rainbows"). Rhythmic control peaks in polishing scenes—short, urgent syntax during high pressure ("She captured Lin's first steps..."). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from tremulous to serene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "polished dreams into amber spheres" does triple duty. Figurative language sparse but potent ("constellation of sorrow"). Final line recharges "crafty hands" motif with devastating precision. Propulsion flawless—every sentence advances emotional or tactile momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "thousand cranes" trope into grief origami with tangible mechanics. Emotional specificity avoids cliché—Lin's voice "bright as lanterns" feels lived. Bold risk: making grief a physical substance (shadow-plague/dream-gems) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
