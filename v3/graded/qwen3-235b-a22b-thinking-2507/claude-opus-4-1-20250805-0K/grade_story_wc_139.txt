<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses (duty vs. truth) manifest in embodied micro-choices: stitching lips while "subtracting sins," hands massaging rigor mortis. Wei’s rage liquefying into confusion avoids therapy-speak. Near-flawless except "mathematics of fair trade" edges toward thematic echo in high-stress moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Wei taking pot/money while Maya buries "what’s left," with cost legible in the ink pot’s weight "heavier now with truth." Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as ash revelation reframes ink pot’s meaning. Orientation solid by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: embalming tools enable key actions (needle for lip-stitching, foundation restoring color). Ink pot’s transformation from stolen object to ash-container charges closure. "Deathly vitality" phrase slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete prep room pressures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maya’s agency: breach → admission → envelope reveal → ash revelation. Cost unmistakable as she stitches father’s lips shut, acknowledging debt. "Mathematics" line risks telling but saved by prior concrete math motif ("calculate what people want to believe").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ink pot’s ash transformation reweights "fair trade" as debt acknowledgment, not balance. Final image ("subtracting sins from love") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Father’s "cancer keeping honest books" avoids platitude through visceral context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maya’s clinical lexicon ("rigor mortis," "compound interest") mirrors embalmer’s precision. Wei’s clipped dialogue ("That ink pot belongs to my family") contrasts her rhythmic control. Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction without voice rupture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "formaldehyde-tinged air" does triple duty (sensory/mood/stakes). Only flaw: "deathly vitality" phrase slightly abstract in peak beat, muddying otherwise concrete propulsion. Final line’s "Everything" achieves crystalline density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: con artist’s daughter using his math metaphor for truth-seeking, not deception. Ink pot’s ash transformation avoids redemption tropes by having Maya admit "it’s not enough." Specificity (embalming cream, compound interest records) grounds universals.</comment>
