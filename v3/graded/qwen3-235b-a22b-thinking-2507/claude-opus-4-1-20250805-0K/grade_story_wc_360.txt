<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but micro-choices under pressure lack specificity; the "mathematics of emotion" motivation isn't tested through actionable trade-offs despite strong embodied contradictions like "seventeen different mouths" crystallizing the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with the typography realization, but the "cost proof test" stumbles slightly—the felt cost of identity loss ("couldn't remember which personality was originally hers") leans abstract versus viscerally dramatized in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Topaz workshop functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (refracting starlight onto plates) and charges closure via drying sheets becoming "a constellation of meaning," satisfying the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation through vanishing stars deepens emotional stakes texturally, but protagonist agency lacks visible testing—the dominant stake (preserving empathy via typography) isn't challenged by concrete trade-offs beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from printing mechanics; the final line ("everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts") reweights prior material without moralizing, offering resonant non-literal resolution to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prismatic patterns across printing plates") and rhythmic control under pressure excel, though "grief multiplied by infinity" drifts into abstract diction during high-stakes moments, slightly undermining lexical consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "grief multiplied by infinity" functions as borderline therapy-speak in a peak beat, triggering a minor Overwriting Check penalty despite otherwise high density and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress printing and cosmic empathy elevates tropes, though "borrowed personalities" concept echoes familiar empathy narratives; risk-taking (math-to-typography pivot) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
