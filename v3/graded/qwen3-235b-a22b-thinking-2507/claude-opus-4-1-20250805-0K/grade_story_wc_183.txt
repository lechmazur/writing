<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory impulses (scientific rigor vs. emotional need) act simultaneously; her final choice to carry the swatch earns closure through cellular-memory stakes. Coraline’s "disturbed water" embodiment avoids twin clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "carrying proof of the unprovable" crystallizes irreversible stakes. Accumulative lens holds—the fog’s memory-altering pressure tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The emerald swatch constrains every choice, charging the final image ("warm green pulse against her palm"). Carnival decay isn’t backdrop; salt-corroded ladders and mirror mazes actively pressure navigation and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving twin’s existence) tightens as fog alters memories, forcing Marina’s renunciation of easy forgetting. Cost is legible in "never quite recapture what was already yours"—a conceptual price woven into her DNA.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through swatch cards as living evidence, not moralizing. Final image reweights "unkindled solace" as active guardianship: "named guardian of the nameless" answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "rustled calliope pipes singing ghost notes" filters decay through Marina’s scientific gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure ("slides in an old projector") avoids lyric drift while compressing time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; every line propels meaning. "Painted backdrop waves had peeled into tentacles of canvas" merges setting and theme without overwriting. Final image’s tactile warmth ("green pulse against her palm") crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms genetic science into myth through "garden of forgotten names." Swatch cards as living evidence feel inevitable—no trope reliance. Risk-taking (carnival as neurological metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
