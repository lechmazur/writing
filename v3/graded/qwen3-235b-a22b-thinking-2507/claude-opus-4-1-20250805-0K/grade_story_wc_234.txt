<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority shines through embodied frustration ("sting of almost-but-not-quite success") and micro-choices like clutching the shell. Marcus actively pressures her avoidance, making their dynamic a crucible. Minor deduction: "scientifically romantic" phrasing slightly over-articulates the theme near climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a flawless Conceptual Repricing: "the real discovery couldn't be replicated" crystallizes the cost with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors instantly ("dying heart at twilight"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to the whispered-name epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ember nexus actively constrains choices as it cools, while the nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that charges closure when levitating. Twilight isn't cliché but integral to the "density" premise. Caps short of 9+ as environment doesn't quite shape final tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Lyra's agency ("I need to revalue everything"), narrowing options from solitary capture to collaborative witness. Cost is unmistakable in "presence needs witness" and the unreplicable discovery. Perfect for length—one deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from shell spirals and pocket-suns, avoiding moralizing. Final image "spiraling home" reweights the premise non-literally: presence as relational density. No thematic echo—Marcus's "You did it" correction delivers earned resonance without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: alchemist's precise observations ("calcium curves," "crystalline veins"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short sentences for tension ("Lyra shook her head"). Dialogue carries subtext through silence and patience, never explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; each line multiplies meaning ("sting of almost-but-not-quite success" embodies scientific frustration). Final line's rhythm ("a small infinity, spiraling home") delivers closure without overwriting. Deducted 0.1 for one borderline abstract phrase ("scientifically romantic").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist breakthrough" trope through emotional specificity—density of presence as relational gravity. Shell integration makes premise irreplaceable. Slight deduction: "palette of resolve" phrase borders on familiar, though deeply earned in context.</comment>
