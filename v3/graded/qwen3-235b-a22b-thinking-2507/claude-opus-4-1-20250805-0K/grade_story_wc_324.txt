<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's whispered "I can help you" amid terror—fear and resolve coexisting without therapy-speak. Flaws (unintended heroism) drive credible endurance, but Mrs. Valdez's theft lacks prior hints, slightly weakening causality for the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "seventeen hearts remembered how to speak" crystallizes the stakes' reweighting under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is rock-solid by line 3, and the lens holds through the photograph's evolution without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium constrains choices relentlessly—orchids leaning away, copper taste signaling thinning boundaries—and charges the final image as the mist lifts. Micro-setting (hearing aid, photograph) directly shapes tactics and closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via sensory deepening (pulses shifting to SOS rhythm), driven by Mara's agency interpreting the hearing aid. Cost is visceral in the photograph's fading faces, though the basement location reveal edges toward convenience without sufficient prior constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "incidental heroism" as organic action, not moralizing: the final line reweights it via "refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear" without abstraction. Avoids thematic echo despite high conceptual density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—Mara notices sound frequencies, not visuals—and prose rhythm mirrors her stress (e.g., "hearing aid shrieked" shortening syntax). No head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("mist curled like breath through broken teeth"), but adjacent lines about the photograph ("grew warm"/"pulled it out") risk paraphrase-loop cadence. No artifacts touch closure; final line’s propulsion is exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "hearing dead" trope via specific, grounded details: grief as contagious virus, "contact tracer for hearts." Emotional truth in "vulnerable voices" avoids genericity; the birthday dirge twist feels earned and fresh.</comment>
