<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses (scientist vs. seeker) act simultaneously in the oxygen-depletion crisis; her final choice to join the temple earns cost through visceral surface memories flooding back as compound depletes, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Maya exhaling the compound to inhale temple water crystallizes her surrender, with the vial's empty ascent mirroring her choice. Accumulative lens holds as "gathered hush" density reweights eternity's cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystal vial constrains every choice (20-minute countdown) and charges the final image ("drift upward like a prayer"). Temple architecture actively shapes navigation ("doorway that shouldn't exist"), making micro-setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Maya's agency: "Time ran short" quantifies the vial's depletion, narrowing options to surface or surrender. Cost becomes physical when last breaths flood her with daughter's laughter, making the sacrifice legible before her choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not statement: "harness the ephemeral—not to possess it, but to become it" crystallizes in Maya's final inhalation. No moralizing; the drifting vial reweights preservation as surrender, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mathematics of impossibility," "water formed architecture") modulates under stress. Sentences compress during crisis ("Time ran short. The vial contained...") while maintaining rhythmic control through the closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "distress signal sender grew warm" does triple duty (plot device, thematic echo, sensory anchor). Final image "unsnarl from time itself" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes via biological specificity (17-year flora compound) and non-Western cosmology. "Machine for capturing moments" gains freshness through voluntary sacrifice mechanics, avoiding derivative "ancient tech" clichés.</comment>
