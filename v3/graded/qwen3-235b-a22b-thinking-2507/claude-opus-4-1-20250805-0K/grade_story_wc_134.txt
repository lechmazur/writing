<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear/curiosity) acts simultaneously during shadow coalescence; final renunciation of prophetic sight earned by cave pearl's dissolution and pilgrim's presence at closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dissolved pearl and shimmering ordinary world reconfigure reality with undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens held since paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal cave actively constrains perception—bioluminescent shadows force Vera to "inhabit the present," directly charging the final image where dissolved pearl leaves luminescence under her skin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: overlapping shadows' unpredictable formations narrow options until Vera's awareness flows into them, with cost legible in the pearl dissolving as she learns to "inhabit the present."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Final image ("ordinary world shimmer with hidden enchantments") reweights "bright darkness" as non-literal answer to "where is magic?" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo through embodied sensory shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "bioluminescent minerals traced constellations across the ceiling, creating overlapping shadows that seemed to breathe"; rhythmic control intensifies during crystal song without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the pearl hummed against her skin with a frequency that made her teeth ache" achieve high density without muddle, propelling toward closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms clairvoyant trope through geological specificity—crystals singing "in the spaces between sound and silence" creates fresh inflection that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
