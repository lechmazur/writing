<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in climax; motivation clear but interiority leans abstract ("broken rhythm" shows embodied emotion yet "dreamless one" risks stock phrasing). Micro-choice singing demonstrates value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: Kess's endurance forecloses pirate threat with felt cost ("watching him disperse"). Accumulative lens holds through quantum bloom patterning to crystallized final image reweighting "fractured world."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glowing dune actively constrains choices (pirate materializes from it) and charges closure ("dune sang along"). Quantum flowers' wave-function collapse directly enables cargo protection tactics, satisfying 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when pirate reaches for nightmare container; Kess's agency (singing) drives escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable: "hand passed through empty air" shows tactical alteration with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("fractured lullaby for a fractured world learning to bloom again") reweights Q1's "broken rhythm" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "seeds for unlit corners" avoids thematic echo while charging emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand grains dancing upward in helical patterns") filters quantum physics through Kess's POV. Rhythmic control under pressure ("sang the fractured lullaby louder") teaches pattern early and pays off in closure cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals occasionally everywhere and nowhere at once" compresses complex physics without muddle. Final line's cadence ("fractured world learning to bloom again") achieves high density with propulsion, no figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "guardian" trope through quantum specificity: "chess clock frozen at midnight" as quantum anchor feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric sci-fi) heightens stakes coherently; no derivative elements or middle-ground hedging.</comment>
