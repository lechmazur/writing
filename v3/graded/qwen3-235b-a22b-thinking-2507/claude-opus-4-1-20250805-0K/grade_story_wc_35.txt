<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miran's contradictory impulses—fleeing vs. subsuming—manifest through embodied choices (trembling hands, tasting empires), avoiding therapy-speak. Her chef-specific interiority ("flavor profiles as distinct as any spice") roots motivation in causality that compels the climax choice with visible cost: becoming "heavy with purpose."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: releasing the pool reconfigures the pavilion's burden into acceptance with undeniable cost ("body heavy with purpose"). The Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the rain-triggered memory density escalates pressure until the visceral "sandstorm" of sorrow, making the starlit forgiveness image legible under the dominant textural drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The tidal pools function as essential micro-setting, constraining Miran's choice (subsumption requires touch) and charging the closure when transformed to "clear as glass." Coral pavilion's physical presence beneath sand makes remorse tangible, while rain-drenched fortress actively triggers the haunting's resolution, avoiding generic desert tropes through chef-specific sensory filtration ("taste of exile").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (will she digest centuries of regret?) escalates purely through Accumulative pressure: each memory layer (commander, children, merchants) deepens emotional density until the "sandstorm" of sorrow. Cost is unmistakable—"body heavy with purpose" carrying "digested grief of ages"—with agency driving the pivotal subsumption choice under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: remorse metabolized into acceptance via the feast's "taste of exile" becoming "acceptance." Final image ("stars that seemed... to shine without sorrow") reweights prior material as resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in sensory action ("brittle on surface, flexible at core") rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through chef's senses ("salt and sorrow," "flavor profiles"). Under stress, syntax compresses ("She felt them all...") without breaking voice. Zero filter verbs; diction stays within Miran's lexicon ("metabolize," "digested grief"), while rhythmic control heightens pressure in the subsumption beat ("tasted empires rising and falling").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density propels ("Hours passed, or perhaps minutes—time moved differently"). Figurative language serves pressure ("frozen scream" aligns with chef POV), and final line ("sounded like forgiveness") avoids sentimentality through concrete action. Minor overwriting risk in "crystallized time" offset by consistent culinary metaphor integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via chef-specific lens: "taste memories" isn't gimmick but integrated with identity (pavilion as ingredient). Emotional contagion via touch makes abstract remorse visceral. "Sturdy brittle" tone modulates from fragile to resilient, charging the forgiveness whisper. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—metabolizing grief into cuisine feels inevitable.</comment>
