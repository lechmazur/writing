<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels through concrete actions (feather trembling "from memories escaping"), but Marcus's 17-year quest lacks specific micro-choices under pressure; transformation feels earned yet slightly abstract in the final realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with conceptual cost ("memories were composting to nourish something new"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation to the singing fountains without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The city's dry fountains as "accumulated time" directly constrain choices (feather unsticking memories), charging the final image; sensory specificity ("taste of centuries") avoids cliché while reflecting Marcus's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marcus's agency—unsticking memories at each basin narrows options toward ritual completion—but the geese's pause as live clock slightly softens the cost's immediacy during the central action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the "composting" metaphor reweighting memory's purpose; avoids moralizing despite philosophical depth, with the singing fountains offering resonant closure to the forgetting premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous skeptic" noticing temporal anomalies) shines, but late abstraction ("realistically imaginative") drifts from Marcus's concrete lexicon, briefly undermining voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("geese paused mid-flight, frozen like a compass needle refusing north"), though "defiant hush" repetition creates a minor paraphrase loop near closure, dulling final image impact by 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes "forgotten fountains" trope with fresh mechanics (memories as compost), but "realistically imaginative" label risks abstraction; risk-taking in temporal physics heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
