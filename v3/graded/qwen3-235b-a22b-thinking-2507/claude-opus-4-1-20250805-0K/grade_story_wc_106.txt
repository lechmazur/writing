<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("theft" vs. "archaeology") and embodied emotion in Cassia’s micro-choices (trailing fingers on flowers, studying the portrait shift) earn the mother’s catharsis. Mother’s "voice broke" avoids therapy-speak but her sudden relief lacks sufficient struggle to fully charge the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Cassia’s final line reweights the premise with conceptual cost ("truth is more beautiful than the lie, even when it hurts"), crystallizing stance under Accumulative/Textural lens. Moonbeam pulse agreement makes cost legible without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emerald tiles and moonbeams create luminous specificity, but setting doesn’t constrain choices—Cassia operates unimpeded. The moonbeam jar (micro-setting) charges the final image yet fails to alter tactics during the portrait reinterpretation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (revealing hidden truth) tightens through Cassia’s agency: applying moonbeams shifts the portrait’s meaning, forcing the mother’s confrontation with loss. Cost is unmistakable in the mother’s weeping relief and Cassia’s burden of "seeing past beauty."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action—moonbeams stripping "glamour" to expose longing—avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "truth is more beautiful" reweights the golden hour’s deception as non-literal answer, with mother’s tears proving conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Cassia notices "amber glow," "molecular gaps," and "silver patterns," filtering everything through her light-obsessed POV. Rhythmic control peaks in the climax ("laughter remained, but now it carried an undercurrent of longing").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("bouquet of white orchids and yellow roses she’d arranged earlier—a code") propels momentum. Minor overwriting in "silver threads spiral upward like smoke" slightly muddles the moonbeam’s action in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magical realism" tropes through specific light physics and emotional archaeology. The moonbeam reinterpretation mechanic feels inevitable, with "truth is more beautiful" synthesizing premise and stakes into a fresh, non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
