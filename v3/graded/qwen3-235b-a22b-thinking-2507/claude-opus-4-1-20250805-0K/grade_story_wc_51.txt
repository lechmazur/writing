<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "boundary-lessly trapped" paradox; embodied emotion via burner's weight shifts avoids abstraction. Micro-choice of touching oxidized brass crystallizes grief without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "weight of weightlessness" reconfigures entrapment/freedom with conceptual cost ("prisons we weave ourselves"). Orientation perfect by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through calcifying patterns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bronze grotto’s acoustics directly constrain choice (orienting head for whale-song frequency) and charge final image ("dimensions settling"). Starlight-on-bronze calcifies into thematic weight—environment as active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density: "burden of mountains dreaming" deepens entrapment paradox through sensory accumulation. Cost legible in burner’s weight gain ("Seventeen grams, plus starlight"), narrowing Mara’s world to recursive calculation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("weight of weightlessness") reweights entrapment as freedom without moralizing. Theme emerges from calcified whalebones and oxidized brass—no abstract statements, only resonant paradox earned through pattern-weaving.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "suspended pearls" and "shingled hush"—Mara’s fractal mind shapes every image. Rhythmic control intensifies during calcification ("spiral tightened") without line-level artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; each sentence advances multiple layers (e.g., "brass weight anchored her to simpler geometries" fuses object, emotion, backstory). "Oxidized brass that grew heavier" exemplifies textural density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "lighthouse keeper’s daughter" trope via weight-as-grief physics. Original synthesis: fractal math as emotional calculus where "seventeen grams" feels viscerally true. No safety-hedging in her paradoxical freedom.</comment>
