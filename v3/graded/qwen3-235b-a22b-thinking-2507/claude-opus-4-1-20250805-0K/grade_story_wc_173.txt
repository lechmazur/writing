<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (celibacy vs liberation) act simultaneously in thread-untangling micro-choices; final transformation earned through embodied echoes with visible cost in melted snow circles reflecting authentic self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (Academy's empty sanctuary proving "dangerous seduction" of self-liberation); accumulative lens holds via echo-density escalation that narrows Lyralei's options toward inevitable unlocking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Silver courtyard functions as micro-setting: snow-melt circles physically manifest transformation, constraining the final image while charging "authentic self" revelation; body-as-setting shapes every choice from thread-untangling to dancing rebellion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lyralei's agency as each unraveled thread releases echoes that compound pressure; cost is unmistakable in the Academy's irreversible loss and her snow-melted footprints foreclosing conformity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Final image reweights "devotion without submission" through concrete particulars (melted snow circles, singing rebellion), avoiding moralizing while offering resonant answer via bodily poetry claiming its own language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "threads hummed with old magic" and snow-bright air dancing; rhythmic control under pressure (shortening phrases during unraveling) taught early and paid off in closure's crystalline final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow melted in perfect circles" crystallizes cost without figurative muddle; minor register drift in "alarming thing about serenity" barely dents propulsion in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through specific mechanics (echoes as crystallized longings, threads as "possibilities twisted into chains"); "bodily poetry" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, risking lyric compression that heightens stakes.</comment>
