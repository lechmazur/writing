<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (professional skepticism vs wonder), but pilgrim's thin motivation limits relationship depth despite pivotal role in closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("filling the missing pieces she hadn't known were empty"); Accumulative lens holds through thermal discovery pattern to resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory actively constrains choices (tiles visible only in specific light), with drone's thermal imaging as micro-setting that charges the final projection of star trails.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through thermal-guided search; cost is Kira's transformed worldview ("perpetual surprise into wonder"), though emotional payoff slightly outweighs tactical consequence at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing by embedding theme in tile mechanics; pilgrim's "mapping resonance" line skirts thematic echo but final image ("natives of the universe") reweights belonging without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through drone-tech lens ("copper light bleeding," thermal "blooms"); rhythmic control falters slightly in "perpetual wonder" abstraction during peak transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("grinding whisper," "hum, each one contributing"); minor cliché ("resonate in chest") redeemed by context in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of print technology and cosmic belonging transforms "frequency" trope; emotional specificity in quiet transformation avoids generic spirituality.</comment>
