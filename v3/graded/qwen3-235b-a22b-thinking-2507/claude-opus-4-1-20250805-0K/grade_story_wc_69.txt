<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("expectantly resigned but no longer bitter") and embodied emotion ("eyes filled") culminate in the earned choice to pass the zither. Micro-choice admitting only three modes playable reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("let it denote not what was lost") reconfigures the vanishing arts premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("arts vanish not when institutions abandon them..."). Accumulative pressure builds through instrument additions narrowing options to communal creation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet library's sound-absorbing quality isn't atmospheric filler—it enables the music session and charges the final image ("holding the echo"). Autumn leaves simile evolves into thematic resonance ("beauty from dying leaves") by closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes transform from preservation ("sealing away") to adaptation ("creating something new") through Chen's agency in teaching the three modes. Cost is unmistakable: tomorrow the program ends, but tonight they redefine continuity through collaboration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action—students braiding sounds—not moralizing. Final image of "five different modes that somehow, impossibly, harmonized" answers the central question without stating a moral, resisting simplistic binaries about cultural preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in musical specificity ("shamisen could echo the zither's pentatonic wanderings"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during tension ("Marcus entered, then Yuki") shift to lyrical flow during creation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "velvet library absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain" avoids mixed metaphor. Closure beat ("humming five different modes... harmonized") achieves high density without figurative muddle, recharging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "dying art" trope through specific mechanics: rosette's five modes as both loss and generative constraint. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—closure hinges on sound, not dialogue—without gimmickry.</comment>
