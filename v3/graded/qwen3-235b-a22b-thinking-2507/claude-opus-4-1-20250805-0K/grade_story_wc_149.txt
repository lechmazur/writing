<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("mournful elation") embodied through micro-choices like tapping the bleeding tree while addressing the ghost; ancestral memories flood via bead without therapy-speak. Slight deduction for underdeveloped secondary motivation in ghost bride's debt logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: sunrise and crumbling bead crystallize irreversible freedom with visible cost ("tasting salt and liberation"). Orientation clear by para 2; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as density shift (cracking bead) reweights debt with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard constrains every choice—mercury pools feed vines that kill thieves, resin becomes tinctures. Final image (ordinary apples, thawing fields) charges closure by transforming the setting's very rules with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (debt repayment) tightens via bead's pulsing rhythm and Marlow's translucence, but "resonant awakenings" mechanism arrives late (para 7), slightly weakening escalation. Cost unmistakable: freedom requires dissolution of their bond, shown in weeping and crumbling bead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image (sunrise painting walls gold while fields thaw) resonates as non-literal answer to "beautiful, venomous love" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars—amber tears becoming tinctures, ordinary fruit replacing alchemy—not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "luminescent fruits pulsed like hearts," "laughter like crystalline frost." Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (short sentences as bead cracks). No head-hopping; voice distinct in ghost's "lovingly venomous" dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "mournful elation" refrain gains weight through variation. High density: "roots drinking from pools of liquid mercury" conveys setting, stakes, and character in one stroke. Minor register drift in "resonant awakenings" (slightly academic for Marlow).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemy tropes transformed via specific logic (philosopher's stone soil, mercury-fed vines). "Lovingly venomous" love reconfigured through Marlow's embodied cost—translucence, weeping salt—not generic ghost lore. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
