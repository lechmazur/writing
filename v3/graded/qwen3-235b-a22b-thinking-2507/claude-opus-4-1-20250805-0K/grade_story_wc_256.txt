<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Vera's shift from hollow ritual to creation; embodied emotion in "powerfully gentle movements" and "rough like her grandmother's lens" avoids labels. Final choice earned through micro-choices like lens use and bell improvisation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "connection isn't something you discover... you create it" reweights the premise with visible cost in the "rough" texture of new sounds. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shift to "sound of discovery itself".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Carbide lens functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (peering through it triggers shift) and charges final image ("rough like her grandmother's lens"). Golden shadows evolve from atmosphere to thematic carrier in the "deepen[ing]" light during her composition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redefining connection) tightens through Vera's agency: questioning assumptions leads to improvisation, narrowing options from prescribed ritual to creation. Cost legible in "rough" new sounds replacing archived silence, though escalation slightly delayed until lens moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: prism-bells' "imperfect surface" refracting light becomes metaphor for meaningful connection. Final image ("building, one perfectly imperfect note") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Vera's acoustic focus ("intervals that make air shimmer") and miner-heritage lens. Rhythmic control shines in cadence shifts from ritual ("prescribed sequence") to improvisation, though minor POV drift in "maintenance worker peers in" description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density in "cathedral of potential" reframing. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" equivalent ("manufactured journey through humanity's lost acoustic heritage") slightly dulls peak-beat immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archiving and human connection avoids tropes through specific details (Carolina parakeet, miner's rock-taps). Bold risk in making "lost sounds" irrelevant to closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
