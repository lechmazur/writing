<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through Mara's embodied connection to the amber and subsonic guilt, but Dr. Kepler remains underdeveloped as pressure source; micro-choices during tattooing reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the cracked pendant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively when firmware displays "Thank you for remembering us," crystallizing options with conceptual cost (digital ghosts acknowledged); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase to final lullaby image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber pendant constrains every choice—from focusing frequencies to cracking during climax—and charges the final image; meteorite ink and laboratory atmosphere evolve causally with the haunting resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency as she translates firmware's crying into constellations; the felt cost (amber's fracture, transformed guilt) visibly alters tactics and charges the closure image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "deleted things that mattered enough to haunt," reweighted by the final constellation's pulse; avoids moralizing while offering non-literal answer to digital guilt through tangible memorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "subsonic guilt" and "meteor hush" lexicon; rhythmic control shifts from static cries to mathematical translation, with all elisions (temporal folds) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "guilt had accumulated like sediment, eventually achieving its own twisted consciousness"; no figurative muddle despite lyrical peaks in the constellation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted firmware" trope through amber's physical tethering and mosquito's ancient blood; synthesis feels inevitable as digital ghosts become "tattooed onto reality itself" with emotional specificity.</comment>
