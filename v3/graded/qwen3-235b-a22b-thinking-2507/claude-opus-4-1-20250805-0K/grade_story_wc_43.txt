<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses (fractured vinyl reflection vs serene hands) and causal final choice—mounting the vinyl to gift continuity—earn her flawless goodbye motivation through embodied stakes, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the matched vinyl fragments crystallize "every ending is also a continuation" under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting hospice sounds into a "sprawling symphony" as Maya walks away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The broken vinyl fragment constrains every choice—from commissioning the frame to the final mounting—and charges the closure image, transforming from Mr. Chen’s relic into a "complete circle, cracked but whole" that reconfigures mortality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Escalation via Maya’s recording project deepens the dominant stake (finding music in dying) through protagonist agency: ventilator rhythms and chemo drips narrow options toward the reunification climax, with her departure as visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: Beethoven’s "Ode to Joy" crack evolves into the album’s symphony, offering a resonant answer to mortality without moralizing—only the mounted vinyl’s "cracked but whole" image reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hymning the mundane" reframes squeaks into sacred sounds) modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in "elevator’s ding into melody" avoids uniformity while teaching its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sunlight filled the space like an anthem" slightly strains metaphor but serves closure density. Final line’s "promise" avoids muddle by rooting beauty in "leaving" through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms hospice tropes via specific sonic alchemy (ventilator as rhythm section), with risk-taking structure where accumulated sounds reconfigure mortality—freshness anchored in Jamie’s chemo drip and Mr. Chen’s vinyl.</comment>
