<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction in bell tuner; her "infinitely patient" trait remains label-only without visible trade-offs (e.g., no exhaustion during walks). Thomas serves as observer, not active participant in key decisions—micro-choices like chalk-mark placements lack emotional stakes. Strengths: embodied actions (kneeling by fountain, heel placement) ground motivation. Final endurance earns closure but interiority stays surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: town's continued dance crystallizes options with felt cost ("keeping shared balance in a world prone to forgetting"). Orientation anchors by line 10 (Millhaven, bell tuner, pre-collapse). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via density of footsteps, not causal turns. Minor flaw: "collapse" remains off-page, slightly weakening cost legibility despite final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobblestones function as micro-setting that constrains choices (chalk-marked steps) and charges closure ("footsteps on cobblestones... children laughing"). Fountain's return to flow directly results from footsteps, proving environmental causality. Archway straightens via rhythm—physical rules remain consistent. Final image recharges "stones singing" motif with undeniable pressure, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining heartbeat against forgetting) tightens through accumulating participants and visible effects (cracks sealing, fountain flowing). Escalation driven by collective agency: children → mothers → fathers joining walks narrows options toward shared rhythm. Cost is legible in perpetual effort required ("infinitely patient, infinitely alive"), charged by final image. Perfect Accumulative escalation under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of harmony vs. forgetting emerges through concrete actions (steps as prayer), not abstraction. Final image ("ghost town that learned to live again... moving together") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo: "simple magic" is character voice, not authorial. Slight flaw: "prone to forgetting its own rhythm" edges toward abstraction but saved by tactile context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "stones singing," "symphony—now broken," "tone hung like a promise." Rhythmic control mirrors theme (e.g., "roll forward. Listen." cadence). Opening/closing lines ("thrummed with life"/"infinitely alive") bookend with textural precision. No POV leakage; lyrical compression taught early ("every footfall created a note") and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; sentences do triple duty ("footsteps on cobblestones told stories... where merchants once danced"). Final line's cadence ("infinitely patient, infinitely alive") crystallizes theme without muddle. "Prone to forgetting" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete verbs ("keeping," "moving"). High density in peak beats: tuning fork strike matches footsteps with resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magical fixer" trope via cobblestone physics (steps as structural repair). Fresh angle: collapse prevented not by force but "shared balance" ritual. Emotional truth in collective effort avoiding easy solutions. Slight deduction: "infinitely patient" archetype has familiar roots, though specificity (ebony tuning fork, chalk marks) elevates it. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
