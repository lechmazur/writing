<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (medallion drop, keystone warmth), but emotional progression under stress lacks layered irrationality; "brilliant dimness" realization risks over-clarity without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: density increases via mist luminance patterns culminating in CR ("last sacred act was imperfection") with undeniable conceptual cost. Minor deduction as mist-walking leap lacks sufficient internal escalation prior to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The keystone functions as micro-setting, charging closure when transformed from "heavy" burden to "light as mist" talisman. Spire's "crystalline walls" recharging from "last light" to "first light" crystallizes the thematic shift with environmental precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency (unstrapping medallion → stepping onto mist → activating keystone), with conceptual cost legible in "imperfection as sacred." Hairline flaw: machine pressure feels distant during mist sequence, slightly diluting immediacy of cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (failed spells → crooked lines → ice flowers blooming "rooted in nothing"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("cape woven from dawn itself") resonates without stating the thesis, though "missed note" abstraction nearly trips into thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind above earthly concerns," "brilliant dimness") with rhythmic control under pressure; tension tightens syntax ("She stepped out onto nothing"). Minor register drift in "algorithms determining exact shade of beauty" slightly jars POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("keystone grew warm... began to shift" advances character/object/theme). Final line crystallizes without overwriting, though "algorithms determining" could use stronger verb for peak propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "underachiever finds worth" trope through specific magic system (mist walking, brilliant dimness); emotional truth in "failed spell that opened doorways." Slight trope familiarity in "underachieving mage" prevents 9.0+.</comment>
