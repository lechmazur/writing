<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (burning card to destroy fate yet seeking it) drive the climax; embodied grief ("hole in soul gaped wider") avoids label-speak. Final choice earned by prior causality with visible cost: "expanding it into something wider."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: apple consumption creates "third path" with felt cost ("expanding the hole"). Accumulative lens holds—density increase (bone cathedral, pulsing apple) reweights stakes. Cost proof: "patching not just the hole... but expanding it" crystallizes trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains every choice (apples as destiny vessels); the burned card’s ash reshaping into "something new" charges the final image. Micro-setting (Mara’s palm warming with the card) directly alters tactics during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: temperature drop, keeper’s appearance, and pulsing apple deepen pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable—"expanding [the hole] into something wider" shows irreversible change. Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "bartered destinies" mechanics become the non-literal answer ("living them as one"). Avoids moralizing; final ash image reweights "reckless idealism" without stating a moral. Elena’s "fiercely gentle" trait integrates organically into Mara’s transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "inlaying meaning everywhere" filters ossuary observations. Rhythmic control under pressure ("dusky resolve settling into her bones like sediment") modulates with emotional intensity. Keeper’s dialogue carries subtext without ventriloquism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light flooded through her, not Elena’s light alone but something new" achieves high density. No figurative muddle in climax—prose accelerates with short clauses during the bite. Opening/final lines ("burned tarot card"/"ash... shape of something new") reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "magical orchard" trope via specific rules (glowing apples = abandoned destinies). Emotional truth in "reckless idealist" protagonist avoids cliché. Final ash reshaping feels inevitable yet fresh—a non-obvious synthesis of grief and hope.</comment>
