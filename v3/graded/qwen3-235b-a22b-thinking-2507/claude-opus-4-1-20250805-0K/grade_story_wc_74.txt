<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("methodically hopeful" yet paralyzed) manifests in brush-dipping micro-choices; embodied exhaustion ("paint-stained hands") avoids label-speak; final endurance earns cost via solitude loss as greenhouse becomes communal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "kindness leaves marks deeper than words" crystallizes with visible cost (lost solitude) under Accumulative lens; moonlight-to-dawn pressure reweights stakes through script accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse constrains every choice (moonlight access, herb steam whispers) and charges the final image; "saffron quiet" evolves from oppressive smog to embraced container, passing 9+ gate via environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creative drought vs community connection) tightens through script accumulation; cost legible in "greenhouse became a gathering place" (lost solitude), though off-page message flood slightly dilutes on-page pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars (dumplings, soil-hauling) not abstraction; final image reweights "saffron quiet" as holding fractured community without moralizing, satisfying 9+ quick test through resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste clean air between tomato vines") modulates under insomnia stress; rhythmic control shifts from fragmented moonlight observations to flowing dawn realization, with patterned elision taught early via daydream sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "moon-tipped brush" metaphor maintains coherence through closure; sentence rhythms vary organically ("She hadn't slept for three nights" to lyrical dawn cadence), achieving 9+ propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "art heals community" trope via specific mechanics (moonlight-activated scripts, saffron smog); "methodically hopeful" inflection avoids sentimentality, though derivative premise guardrail caps score despite strong synthesis.</comment>
