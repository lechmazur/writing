<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's contradictory impulses—clumsy fool vs precise spy—shine in the blood-smearing micro-choice; her physical disguise perfectly masks strategic agency under pressure, though minor deduction for unexplored physical strain of embroidery work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Vera's continued stitching while harmonizing with the flame forecloses inaction with visible cost (imminent coup danger), perfectly aligned with Accumulative lens through embroidered density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The needle constrains choices (extracting flame, pricking finger) and charges the final image ("threading one last secret"), transforming embroidery from decorative tool to revolutionary instrument with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crane's visit tightens pressure by confirming coup timing, forcing Vera's final chart completion; her agency drives every escalation (blood code, flame threading) with undeniable conceptual cost (revolution's weight).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through embroidery-as-resistance without moralizing; the final image reweights "unheard stories" as revolutionary intelligence, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity through Vera's embodied sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vera's perceptual signature—filtering stars through thread, hearing silences as data—creates rhythmic control under pressure; compression ("twin moons, silver spoons") teaches pattern early with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "cobalt dome caught autumn's dying light like a bruise" establishes tone without scaffold; minor deduction for "hemoglobin code" slightly disrupting POV lexicon in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through embroidery-as-intelligence-network; the "adjacent possibilities" conceit feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (craft as revolution) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
