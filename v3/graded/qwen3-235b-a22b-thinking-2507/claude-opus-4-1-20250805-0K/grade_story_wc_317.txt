<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s "clarity that comes across the hush of a possibility" versus trembling hands; micro-choices like pressing seed into earth earn closure. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak stress (e.g., fear/responsibility interwoven during planting).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "its seeds would need new guardians" crystallizes fragility of resistance. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via brook’s linguistic shift and geometric roots reweighting urban development stakes. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "babble shifted, became almost linguistic" evolves into final "brook sang on, keeping its secrets." Soil fertility directly enables glowing roots that shatter development plans, constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens: dominant stake (wild space preservation) tightens via malfunctioning survey equipment and shared guardianship. Cost is conceptual (ongoing vulnerability), but development threat remains slightly abstract; concrete surveyor intrusion would heighten felt cost earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through corpse flower’s transformed scent ("rain on hot pavement" vs. stench), reweighting "innovation" without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: "fragrance of hidden possibilities" crystallizes resistance through sensory truth, avoiding binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: Mira notices "geometric patterns" mirroring her escape rooms. Rhythmic control peaks in "storm-born silence... electric, waiting" with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; lyric mode taught early via "whisper of paper against brass" pays off in brook’s song.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "scent of rain on hot pavement, of old books, of bread baking" achieves high density. Minor overwriting in "storm-born silence... dense with unspoken change" slightly slows momentum but doesn’t obscure causality. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms corpse flower trope via scent inversion and urban context. Fresh inflection: escape room logic applied to spatial resistance ("misdirection, like her finest rooms"). Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
