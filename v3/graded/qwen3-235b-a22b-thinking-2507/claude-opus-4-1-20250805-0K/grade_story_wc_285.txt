<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thomas’s contradictory impulses—preserving promises while releasing their burden—drive the distillation climax. The woman’s embodied grief ("tears mixing with mist") avoids therapy-speak, though her characterization leans slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: fog retreat crystallizes the woman’s lightened state with conceptual cost ("weight dissolves into the river"). Accumulative lens holds throughout, with rain gutters’ ticking providing decisive temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing actively constrains choices (visibility for weaving) and charges the final image (fog lifting as burden releases). Rain gutters’ ticking functions as micro-setting that alters tactics under temporal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via Thomas’s needlework reveals the "golden thread" under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: the weight dissolving into the river while retaining the essence of faith, narrowing options to distillation alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("stars that seemed, somehow, newly visible") offers non-literal answer to broken promises—essence persists without burden—avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges organically from fog-weaving mechanics, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thomas’s "spindrift serenity" permeates syntax ("letting understanding percolate through ambient awareness"). Perceptual signature shines in fog-as-sheet-music metaphor, with rhythmic control intensifying during needlework.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rain gutters ticked their metallic rhythm" compresses time, setting, and pressure in one stroke. Figurative language ("palimpsest of promises") clarifies stakes without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise mentor" trope through specific mechanics: promise-distillation via needlework. Emotional truth in burden/essence duality avoids cliché, with "spindrift serenity" offering fresh inflection on resilience.</comment>
