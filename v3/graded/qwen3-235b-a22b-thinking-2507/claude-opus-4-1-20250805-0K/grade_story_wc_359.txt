<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in synesthetic gift, but interior conflict lacks contradictory impulses; Lyrian's choice feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle despite vivid embodied emotion ("violet that tasted of winter mint").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with conceptual cost: Council's meters shatter while aurora transforms the world, fulfilling the amber sheet's purpose with undeniable legibility in "efficiency meters shattered, unable to quantify the unquantifiable."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as active micro-setting: formations become resonant strings constraining Lyrian's action (striker impact), directly charging the final image where "sculpted hush lived on—not as silence, but as the space where miracles waited to sing."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs. rationalism) escalates through sensory density rather than causal turns; one meaningful deepening occurs when the amber sheet's true purpose is revealed, with visible cost in shattered efficiency meters and revived atrophied senses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sensory fusion ("green waves of melody poured down, mixing with magenta harmonies") without moralizing; final image reweights "sculpted hush" into active space for miracles, answering "certify wonder as essential" non-literally with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines through synesthetic compression ("turquoise sound that she could taste as cinnamon"), though "oscillating repose" slightly abstracts during peak action; rhythmic control sustains pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "museum of silence transforming into a cathedral of sensation" borders on overwriting in a high-pressure beat; final image's crystalline clarity ("space where miracles waited to sing") rescues near-9+ status.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and aurora as conductor elevates beyond trope; risk-taking in sensory fusion heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, making wonder's essential nature feel inevitable through specific mechanics like "fossilized resin" notation.</comment>
