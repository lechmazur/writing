<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (preserving truth amid forgeries) is clear and embodied through precise actions like bone-conducting detection, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her calm focus feels consistent yet underdevelops internal struggle despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the algae's eternal pulse reconfigures truth's survival with conceptual cost, and the accumulative lens holds as verification density tightens stakes; minor deduction as cost feels slightly oblique versus viscerally legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The algae-constrained ink is indispensable—visible only under its light, it charges the final image while dictating verification tactics; "vacuum-sealed volumes" and pressure shifts actively constrain choices beyond atmospheric window-dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Blackout pressure coherently narrows options as generators cycle, but escalation relies more on external time pressure than Mira's agency; the conceptual cost (truth obscured until next blackout) isn't unmistakably legible on the final page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "truth would survive, waiting in green-glowing ink" reweights "reclaimed stillness" without moralizing; the algae's pulse offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how truth persists amid erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("books sang a different frequency"), with rhythmic compression under pressure ("minutes at most"); no head-hopping, and elision of backstory serves the accumulative lens without sacrificing momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "surgically replaced specific entries" demonstrates high-density precision, though "infinitesimally thicker" slightly strains diction in a high-pressure beat without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes through sunken-city specificity—the algae's light as truth-revealer feels inevitable; "patient guardians" avoids heroic clichés while risking quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
