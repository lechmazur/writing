<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (solitude vs connection) manifest in micro-choices like seal-handling; final teaching decision earns cost through "this was different" specificity. Lacks deeper flaw escalation beyond observed secrecy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "this was different" reconfiguration. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; meteor/building recitation convergence charges final image. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Desk seal constrains choice across three beats (sealing letter, revealing history, transferring ownership) and charges closure via Marcus's palm-closing gesture. Sensory economy mirrors urgency—tea steam replaces exposition during critical reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (sharing secret ability) tightens through Marcus's escalating proximity ("transparent excuse" to "Teach me"), narrowing Elara's options to guarded endurance or vulnerable teaching. Cost legible in shifted intimacy during meteor climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ending reweights "agreed upon lies" through action (teaching living architecture) not statement. Final image of building "midnight recitation" answers thematic question via charged reciprocity—no moralizing, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fingers patiently nimble," "architecture hummed ancient frequencies") filters all description. Dialogue indirection ("How do you know these things?") carries subtext; stress compresses syntax during meteor climax without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "steam rising like incense" is sole near-cliché in peak beat (−0.1). Propulsive rhythm varies ("She taught dead languages... but her true obsession...") with concrete verbs ("pressed," "traced," "groaned"). Closure beat immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms architectural anthropomorphism via linguistic framing ("structural linguistics," "building's dialect"). Risk-taking (silent conflict, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence; "agreed upon lies" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
