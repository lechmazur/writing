<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is implied through transformation but lacks concrete struggle; "helix-minded" labels verge on diagnostic speech. Micro-choices like neural injection sequence reveal value hierarchy, yet flaws remain abstract without compounding mistakes under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (permanent neural alteration), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) weakens causality. The "museum of interrupted futures" image reweights stakes, yet orientation debt persists in geological time scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon constrains choice via tactile interaction with mirror shards, while the periscope's fractured surface charges the final image. Sensory details like "silver spirals" and "geological patience" reflect urgency without checklist repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Vera's neural modifications narrowing her options, with felt cost in irreversible consciousness alteration. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but the "seventeen dream-patterns" catalog feels procedural rather than deepening the central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—Fibonacci fractures mirroring neural pathways—without moralizing. Final image ("museum of humanity's interrupted futures") reweights ambition through Vera's synapses, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends engineering lexicon ("synaptic plasticity") with poetic compression ("quaking reverie"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("tasted the metallic fear") avoids head-hopping, though "helix-minded" repetition risks becoming a tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, but stacked metaphors ("shadows twisting like DNA strands") risk muddle in high-pressure beats. Propulsion falters slightly during the "seventeen dream-patterns" catalog; final line achieves textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms submarine graveyard trope through "archeologist of abandoned dreams" synthesis. Freshness lies in neural modification as literal bridge between mechanical/biological, though "chaotically precise" risks becoming a hollow motif without deeper integration.</comment>
