<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marion's embodied hope ("strategically creative") drives micro-choices like improvising harmonies; Sophia's arrival lacks prior physicality, slightly weakening the earned cost of reunion despite strong contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with visceral cost ("eyes carrying the weight of dwelling in between frames" and time resuming at 11:48), but orientation anchors who/where/when at ~150 words, triggering −0.4 penalty despite functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Corral bones actively constrain choice (music resonating through them creates harmonics); tidal arbor isn't merely backdrop but shapes the harmonic solution, charging the final compass direction with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation through intensifying magnetic disturbance narrows Marion's options to improvisation, but Sophia's rescue feels slightly convenient—coincidence complicates but the resolution lacks sufficient prior tactical cost to hit 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "refuge" redefinition (not finding lost but creating return paths), crystallized by Sophia's line about compasses pointing to "where home waits to be built"—resonant without moralizing, perfectly reweighting the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hammers strike strings that hadn't been tuned since tidal arbors lifted civilization skyward") shows Marion's musical lens; rhythmic control tightens during the Rachmaninoff climax without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor metaphor clash ("condensation on dry celluloid" vs. "silver emulsion dripping") triggers −0.3 density penalty; otherwise zero loops, high propulsion, and strategic telling (film reel discovery) compress backstory without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of compass storms as "divining rods for regret" transforms tropes; emotional specificity in "steely longing" avoids generic templates, though "walking through water" feels slightly familiar without sufficient transformation.</comment>
