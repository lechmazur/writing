<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in muteness-as-gift paradox; embodied emotion in "water running down arms" during transformation. No secondary character limits micro-choices, but solitary struggle with the fragment creates credible tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with visceral cost: the fragment's complete melting ("water running down Mariel's arms") forecloses preservation paths while crystallizing wonder's perpetuation. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the symphony's ripple.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (urgency of melting) and charges closure (water as cost). Whispering Bluff's cloud-sea setting actively shapes tactics by isolating the tower's broadcast mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: melting fragment (setup) → failed preservation attempts (deepening) → bell integration (tightening). Cost is unmistakable in the fragment's dissolution and irreversible world change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fragment's transformation, but final paragraph's "capacity for enchantment" edges toward thematic echo. Resonant closure image ("wonder would continue to ring") avoids moralizing yet slightly overstates the payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "color of wonder" descriptions; rhythmic control peaks in kinetic sculpture sequence. No POV leakage despite lyrical density—voice modulates perfectly from muted urgency to transcendent resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("shivered," "glistened," "rippled"). Final beat's "preserved essence of awe" risks abstraction but is anchored by "bronze and motion" specificity, avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic truth and visual wonder avoids trope pitfalls. Risk-taking in wordless communication heightens stakes, though "color of wonder" concept borders on familiar magical realism without sufficient transformation.</comment>
