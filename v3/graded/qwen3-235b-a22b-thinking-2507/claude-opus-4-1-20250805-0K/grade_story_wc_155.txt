<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied joy ("chest ache") and fog-dampened soul, but lacks concrete struggle beyond receptivity; micro-choices under pressure (tasting apple seeds) elevate, yet flaws remain too abstract for 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("let joy grow wild again") reconfigures options with felt cost of ephemerality, but "wouldn't last" lacks pinpoint legibility; Accumulative lens holds through density accumulation yet misses Q2's 9+ cost-proof requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresco fragment (tool) constrains choice—she must coax memories from decay—and charges final image ("glowed faintly in her hands"); orchard micro-setting shapes tactics, but district's pressure stays atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs via deepening knowledge network integration, yet cost ("dreams never did") remains conceptual rather than unmistakable; agency in display choice is clear but lacks visible tradeoff escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("apple blossoms never stopped blooming") resonantly answers "can joy persist?" through light-painting mechanics without moralizing; avoids thematic echo while charging prior material with conceptual cost of impermanence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("photons from memory," "lightness felt like") modulates rhythm under pressure, but "she understood now that permanence wasn't the point" slips into helpful narrator syndrome, dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop ("Marina laughed... When had she last laughed?") and near-thematic echo ("burn away the fog entirely") create minor scaffold; otherwise high density with purposeful rhythm, but artifacts prevent 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-as-resistance in fog-shrouded world elevates trope, yet "fog as depression" metaphor lacks sufficient transformation; risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes but stops short of indispensable 9+ synthesis.</comment>
