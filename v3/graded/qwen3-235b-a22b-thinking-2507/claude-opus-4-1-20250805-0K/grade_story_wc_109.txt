<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her simultaneous urgency and patience with the star's fade, embodied through brittle booklet handling and stiff joints after stillness; no stock phrasing despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: her realization that "the endless night was not a destination but a process" reconfigures the map's purpose with felt cost (surrendered immediacy), under Accumulative/Textural lens held since opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flaking gold leaf booklet constrains choice (careful closing to preserve pages) and charges the final image ("another page waited"); storm fort's tremors and frozen waves actively mirror her ambered hush state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake (documenting the star's death) tightens through her misjudged expectation of its finality; the deepening reversal—realizing it "would linger, teaching patience"—narrows her path to endurance with visible cost (abandoned urgency).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ending reweights "endless night" from destination to process through concrete particulars (booklet's crumbling pages, star's pulse), avoiding moralizing; thematic cost is the exquisite patience required to map absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in her silence-centered observations ("veins of sound through silence"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with purposeful fragments ("Listen." "But then she understood.") teaching the accumulative pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "honey" simile compresses time perception without muddle; final line’s "another page waited" charges closure with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomical obsession as cartography of absence; transforms "oracle" trope through specific methodology (cataloguing void flavors), avoiding generic mysticism with tangible booklet mechanics.</comment>
