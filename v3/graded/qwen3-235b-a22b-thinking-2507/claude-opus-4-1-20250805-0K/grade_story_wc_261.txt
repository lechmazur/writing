<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's wound-reopening compulsion as library-seeking manifests in concrete micro-choices (tracing coffee rings, palm-on-glass) with contradictory impulses; final stance crystallizes through embodied cost ("wounds meant to stay open") without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "wounds meant to stay open" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (abandoning closure quest), under Accumulative lens where pattern recognition drives escalation; orientation established by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coffee ring functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (tracing stain) and charges final image (imperfect circle = scar pattern); body-as-setting (bandaged hands) directly enables plant communication at window.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Maya's agency-driven pattern recognition (coffee rings → scars → miracle fragments), reweighting options under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "wounds meant to stay open" crystallizing irreversible stance shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars (coffee rings → dispersed healings), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "miracle" through "smaller doors" without stated moral, earning resonance via ambient healing examples.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading" stains, vegetable grief) taught early; rhythmic control under pressure ("chlorophyll dreams" to "channels through which wonder might flow") pays off pattern; no head-hopping in lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "water seeping through stone" metaphor establishes pattern paid off in "channels through which wonder might flow"; no figurative muddle in peak beats despite density ("root-whispers" to "chlorophyll dreams").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical trauma + botanical telepathy transforms "miracle" trope through ambient healing; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by coffee ring specificity.</comment>
