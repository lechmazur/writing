<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calla’s contradictory impulses manifest physically: phantom stitches while awake, poetic loss fueling myth-weaving. Her "haunting optimism" isn’t stated but tested through sewing "threads that wouldn’t exist until tomorrow," with the salt-crusted succulents embodying earned endurance under ruin. Final choice to walk the paths again crystallizes with visceral cost in "barren ground" growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: children dancing "permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide" reconfigures ruin/reverence with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by word 40 ("dawn," "red canyon," "Calla"). Backstory fragment ("three moons ago") slightly exceeds BRR limits but pivots to present action; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through golden spiral pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The illustration plate (tool) constrains choices: bleeding watercolors guide stitches, warming to trigger children’s movement. Canyon walls charge the final image as both canvas and constraint ("dancing on canyon walls"). Sensory specificity—barnacles on petroglyphs, singing shells—avoids cliché while mirroring Calla’s transformation. Tide pools’ emptiness directly enables treasure discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (transformation vs. restoration) deepen through the golden spiral overlap pattern, narrowing options to "embracing what could be." Escalation lacks on-page pressure build—the "three moons ago" discovery is backstory, not active tightening. Cost is legible in "barren ground" growth but isn’t tested through rising opposition; the labyrinth’s shifts feel predetermined rather than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete accumulation: "broken precedents" scar walls but enable new myths. Final image ("world learning to breathe again") avoids moralizing by charging prior fragments—the dancing children reweight the illustration’s "joy preserved." No thematic echo; complexity lives in "not restoration, but transformation" as the labyrinth becomes "bridge between ruin and reverence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Calla notices "impossible hues" and "frequencies only she could hear," reflecting her myth-weaving state. Rhythmic control peaks in stitching cadence ("a hundred invisible stitches") and lyrical compression ("ocean kissed desert"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during sewing with visceral immediacy ("needle pierced the air itself").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold: "dried blood and hope" compresses emotional/sensory stakes. One paraphrase loop ("stitching new myths from fragments of the drowned world" echoes earlier "weaving words") triggers -0.2. No figurative muddle; "stubborn succulents blooming in salt-crusted crevices" perfectly embodies earned hope without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes flood myth with textile metaphor: "wharf weaver" transforms poet into myth-maker via literal stitching. Fresh inflection in "broken precedents" as physical scars enabling new rules. Avoids tropes through specific logic—lunar path shifts creating golden spiral overlaps—making "haunting optimism" feel inevitable, not saccharine. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens coherence.</comment>
