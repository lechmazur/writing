<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (tracing tendril, humming) shows contradictory impulses—practical tinkerer embracing mystical tradition. Embodied emotion avoids labels; "voice cracked" conveys grief without diagnosis. Micro-choice to teach songs earns closure, but secondary pressure from villagers feels underdeveloped despite on-page presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "heartbeat of reconnection" crystallizes the vine's transformation and village's restored rhythm. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—song density intensifies pressure, narrowing options toward the moonrise deadline. No causality breaks; orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arbor functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (crouching beneath canopy) and charges the final image—blooming vine releasing "perfume of remembrance." Sensory details like "brittle tendril" and "shaft of light" evolve with urgency, avoiding static description. Environment shapes every key beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through temporal pressure ("alignment comes tonight") and Elara's deepening emotional investment, narrowing options to the harvest moon deadline. Agency is clear—her humming directly triggers the vine's revival—but the cost remains slightly abstract until the "heartbeat" payoff. One tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vine's physical transformation ("withered to vibrant"), not moralizing. The final image—"old ways lived again"—resonates as a non-literal answer to cultural disconnection, avoiding tidy binaries. No thematic echo; wisdom arises from concrete actions like teaching forgotten songs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tinkerer's tactile focus ("weathered fingers tracing") and rhythmic control under pressure ("You remember" repetitions). Voice modulates from hushed dawn to communal celebration without POV slippage. Compression in high-stakes beats ("The tendril shivered") teaches the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story ("dawn painted gold across the leaves" sets time/mood/theme). Figurative language stays coherent ("melody wound like morning mist") even in peak beats. Final line crystallizes closure without sentimentality—"old ways lived again" recharges the opening hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "magical restoration" trope through specific details: mending hearts with copper wire, harvest-moon alignment. Emotional truth in elders weeping at stories avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in making songs (not physical action) the remedy heightens stakes, though premise edges close to archetypal.</comment>
