<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "would write them—had written them" tension; embodied "feral nostalgia clawed at her chest" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice of writing the scroll while anticipating its future discovery reveals value hierarchy. Grave scene motivation slightly underdeveloped as inciting incident despite strong flaws-driven exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation perfect by paragraph 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase ("would write—had written—would write"). Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost: "narrative itself is chaos wearing costume of order." Cost proof evident in her writing the very scroll she'll later find, foreclosing linear time belief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Birch bark functions as micro-setting constraining choice (fragile archive vs. fluid dreams); wind/sap details evolve with emotional shifts. Final image of writing "on fresh bark" charges closure through tactile specificity. Mountain setting could better constrain specific choices beyond atmosphere despite strong cabin-as-archive pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (distilling chaos into narrative) signaled by first scroll crackle; deepening through Maya's realization that "narrative itself is chaos" forecloses linear documentation. Escalation driven by protagonist agency when she writes the chronicle acknowledging her fractured state. Cost legible in "jaded wonder" and "exhausted amazement" at her own existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "chronicle they were writing together" without moralizing; final image of "unaware she was already soaring" reweights prior material non-literally. Avoids thematic echo despite philosophical content by rooting insight in scroll-writing action. Conceptual repricing of narrative as chaos charges closure with undeniable social cost of lost coherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallized in "bark peeling from ancient trees" simile; rhythmic compression ("would write—had written—would write") teaches pattern early. First-person POV stays anchored despite multiple iterations; "jaded wonder" modulates to exhausted amazement under pressure. Zero head-hopping even during multi-Maya grave scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wind howled through pines that hadn't existed" demonstrates causal density. Final line "unaware she was already soaring" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Every sentence does triple duty: "hands trembling not from cold but from recognition" advances plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through "feral nostalgia" specificity; birch bark archive makes premise fresh rather than generic. Risk-taking with non-linear structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—the soaring payoff grows organically from eagle dream setup. Emotional truth in "exhausted amazement" avoids template responses to fractured reality.</comment>
