<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" drives tangible choices under pressure, with embodied emotion in her augmented senses. The fossil’s disintegration crystallizes her endurance with visible cost, though internal conflict lacks deeper contradiction beyond purposeful resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the fossil crumbles and Kira realizes she’ll "teach others to hear it themselves," reconfiguring her role with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds cohesively, with density increasing through emotional layers to the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The caves actively constrain choices via tidal breathing and thermal memory, charging the climax where bioluminescent constellations frame the alien encounter. Limestone’s emotion-absorbing property directly enables the closure, meeting the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and the final image’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kira’s agency as she maps the alien entity, narrowing options from documentation to translation with the fossil’s disintegration as felt cost. Pressure intensifies via thermal language’s "colors she had no names for," reweighting humanity’s evolution under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the fossil’s purpose shift from bridge to key—avoiding moralizing. The final image of "maps of tomorrow’s emotions" reweights the premise non-literally, offering earned resonance without stating a moral or false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingertips that could taste temperature") and rhythmic control shine during the alien encounter, compressing tension through precise thermal vocabulary. No head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical to lyrical as pressure mounts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, with high density: "conscious darkness" subtly charges closure without muddle. Minor abstraction in "strange new dance between familiar and impossible" slightly dulls propulsion, but final line’s specificity ("liminal space between sleeping and waking") rescues momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms hibernation tropes via "factually mystical" thermal emotion mapping, avoiding derivative safety. The fossil’s irreplaceable role in unlocking perception feels inevitable, with risk-taking (emotion as temperature) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
