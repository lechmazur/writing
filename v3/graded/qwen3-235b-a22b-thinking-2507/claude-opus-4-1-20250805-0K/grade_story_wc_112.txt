<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in ignoring Vasquez while "On it" — micro-choice reveals hierarchy of values (duty vs discovery) with visible cost in station destabilization. No diagnostic labels; "icy warmth" perception shows embodied cognition under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance shift: "navigator of time’s hidden dimensions" forecloses mechanic identity with felt cost (frost/glows physics). Causal lens holds throughout; lever lock narrows options decisively under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (magnetic nexus) constrains all choices — its twilight alignment dictates experiment window, causes resonance with processors, and charges final image ("twilight glow spreading like honey"). Body/tool integration flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: lever pull → time bleed → station shudder → irreversible physics shift. Cost unmistakable in "frost forming even as they glowed" — tangible price shaping final image under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "time folded like origami" evolves into "temporal vectors pointing in all directions." Final line reweights opening silence without moralizing — earned by xenobiology specimens' role in discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "mechanically warm efficiency" reframes technical jargon as embodied cognition. Syntax tightens under stress ("She pulled the lever further, and..."); zero filter verbs despite high interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost forming on surfaces even as they glowed" delivers paradoxical cost in 7 words. Final line’s "twilight hour ended" callback recharges opening with new meaning — peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through xenobiology constraints: "subdued awakenings" aren’t metaphor but causal mechanism. "Obliging sky mechanic" becomes irreversible identity shift — specific synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
