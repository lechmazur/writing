<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's somatic markers as embodied contradiction ("shoulders tightening, breath catching") powerfully drive choices, but "empathy made tangible" crosses into diagnostic label-speak, triggering a -0.5 penalty per guidelines in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—David’s transformed skepticism into "participatory wonder" visibly forecloses his original stance, while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density accumulation toward the final architecture image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as essential micro-setting; the muscovite sliver’s refractions directly constrain Maya’s gestures and charge the closure’s "illuminated architecture of human connection," satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds as light patterns deepen pressure, narrowing David’s options from skepticism to awe, but the emotional cost of his worldview shift lacks visceral specificity in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete light structures rather than moralizing; the final line reweights "pathways waiting to be illuminated" as a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("somatic markers read like sheet music") and rhythmic control shine, especially in high-pressure beats where syntax compresses ("David gasped as the light began to coalesce") without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density falters with minor redundancy ("fractally precise" repetition in para 1) and four "somatic markers" uses, risking synonym churn, though closure imagery remains sharp and propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" synthesizes fragility and flexibility into an inevitable, fresh metaphor; the neuroscience-art fusion avoids tropes through specific studio constraints and emotional truth in David’s transformation.</comment>
