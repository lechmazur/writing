<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marta’s interior contradiction—pragmatic liar nurturing hope—drives every choice. Her embodied flaw (deception as necessity) visibly costs her isolation; the young woman interaction crystallizes her hierarchy of values without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Marta’s unmeasured luck shift ("blooms in the cracks") reconfigures the premise with felt cost in her weathered hands passing the marble. Accumulative lens holds through ritual repetitions that tighten meaning toward the rustling maze.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cracked marble constrains choice and charges closure—polishing it alters the jasmine’s state, while the final image ("mended and whole") reweights the garden’s rebellion. Micro-setting (copper wires, marbles) drives tactics without symbolic overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Marta gives the marble, foreclosing her solitude with visible cost (the young woman’s skepticism). Agency drives escalation, but the conceptual cost of her lifelong deception lacks one concrete physical toll in the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mended deception" literally (cracked marbles) and conceptually (roses blooming at 2.1), avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "beautiful deceptions, mended and whole" reframes truth without stating it, charging prior material through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice distills Marta’s perceptual signature: "hedgerows that whispered secrets only she could understand" filters world through her conviction. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("fingers trailing") to urgent ("Polish this") under pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "expression both blooming and withering, like fruit ripening toward rot" layers meaning without muddle. Final triple-simile ("laughter, grief, growth") avoids cliché through precise, resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism tropes via concrete stakes: marbles as literalized mended deceptions, not generic symbols. Emotional truth anchors universals in Marta’s tactile rituals, avoiding safety-middle abstraction while heightening coherence.</comment>
