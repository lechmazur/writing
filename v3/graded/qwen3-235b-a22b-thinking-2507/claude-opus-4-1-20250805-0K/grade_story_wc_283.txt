<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority lacks concrete contradiction; "quietly inspired" is label-only without embodied struggle. Motivation shift from preservation to "spinning futures" occurs abruptly without psychological buildup. No visible cost to her realization despite thematic emphasis on stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("golden sand that sparkled like ground amber") crystallizes infinite possibility with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of centuries"). Orientation Test passed via "seventeen years" and "amber warehouse" anchors by line 4. Accumulative lens held consistently with density increase culminating in resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting only at climax (pulsing walls), too late to constrain early choices. Sensory details ("frozen honey" light) vivid but static until final unraveling. Orientation penalty avoided, yet environment fails to charge closure until last third despite strong atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vs. creating wisdom) tightens through button-glowing sequence, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—"truth began to unravel" frames Mara passively. Cost is conceptual (centuries of sand emptying) yet visceral impact diluted by abstract phrasing. Accumulative pressure deepens meaning but avoids tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "lost buttons forming a map of choices," avoiding moralizing. Final line ("everything spoke") reweights "unearthed silence" with profound simplicity, offering non-literal answer to central question. Zero thematic echo; complexity embraced via "infinite garden" metaphor without false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber-colored glass caught light like frozen honey") consistent, but filter verbs ("Mara discovered," "she knew") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. "Quietly inspired" breaks POV modesty via label-only trait. Rhythmic control strong in climax ("sand that fell was both ending and beginning") yet minor register drift in abstract moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("pulverized dreams" compresses theme into concrete image). Minor overwriting in "shimmer of compressed sound waiting to expand" slightly muddles, but closure beat ("everything spoke") achieves crystalline propulsion. No artifacts in final third preserves Q7 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "prophecy" trope through tangible mechanics (buttons as timeline markers), yet "hourglass turner" feels derivative. Canyon echo (9B) provides fresh inflection as physical sound-object. Emotional truth anchors universals via specific debris ("mother's last goodbye"), avoiding safety-middle hedging despite conceptual ambition.</comment>
