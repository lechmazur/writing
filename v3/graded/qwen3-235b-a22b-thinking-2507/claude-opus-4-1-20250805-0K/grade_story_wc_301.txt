<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses embodied in drawing his failure onto the wall while adding "the path he'd taken since"; no therapy-speak as guilt manifests through river-chronicler specifics ("cataloging mayfly larvae" during the accident).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when he writes "Mile marker zero" without a map—the cost of five years trapped in guilt made undeniable by "green overtaking gray" reconfiguring his relationship to time and rivers under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Ivy transforms from "coat" hiding the station to tactile symbol of renewal when he touches it post-epiphany; the bellows' taped patches catching light "like scales" directly charge the final image of forward motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stake (self-forgiveness vs. guilt) tightens through Marcus' agency: dusting the graffiti map forces confrontation, then drawing his own map alters tactics by making failure visible—cost legible in "five years" of numbness paid to reach this moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete river mechanics ("rivers don't flow backward") reweighted by final image of nature reclaiming the station; avoids moralizing as "the current that carries us forward" answers the central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via hydrologist's precise lexicon ("pH readings," "sediment") bleeding into poetic compression ("ivy tapped like patient fingers"); syntax shortens under stress ("His hands trembled") while maintaining scientific rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "taped patches catching light like scales" avoids purple prose by charging closure. One borderline metaphor ("dust wheezed out like a confession") saved by character-specific voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms guilt trope through river scientist's hyper-specific obsession; "daringly methodical" trait causing the accident creates fresh moral calculus where precision becomes fatal flaw, not quirky detail.</comment>
