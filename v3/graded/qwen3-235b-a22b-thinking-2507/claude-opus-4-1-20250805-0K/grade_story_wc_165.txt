<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (engineering spontaneity vs. longing for connection) drive micro-choices; "thumb along diagonal groove" embodies loss without labels. Teen interaction lacks sufficient resistance to fully earn the motivation shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("waves erased footprints"), but the teen's guitar pick feels coincidental rather than earned by Marcus's actions, slightly undercutting causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal arcade functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (timed acts, acoustic spots) and charges closure; "tide clock" pressure is tactile and essential to the final image's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (sustaining wonder against monotony) deepen through audience shifts, but the teen's transformation lacks visible struggle, making the cost of connection feel under-earned despite the tide's return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "calculated wilderness" reconfiguration at closure; final image ("waves erase footprints") offers non-literal answer to transience without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("darkness pooled," "footsteps quickened") with rhythmic control; "calculated wilderness" phrase edges toward abstraction but remains anchored in Marcus's POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "stars pricked through marine layer like pinholes" exemplifies high-density imagery that propels momentum without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of street performance tropes via chess mechanics and tidal stage; "diminished sevenths sea shanty" specificity transforms familiar material organically without gimmickry.</comment>
