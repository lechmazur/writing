<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wavering idealism" to "solidified certainty" shift, but Elara's abrupt conviction upon seeing ships lacks sufficient causal groundwork for full 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("nail grew warm... pointing the way home") crystallizes options with undeniable cost; causal lens holds perfectly from decoded stanzas to broadcast decision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" mixed metaphor violates physical logic in high-pressure beat; otherwise exemplary propulsion with no template cadence in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate fiction and historical exile protocol; copper nail's magnetic function transforms grave artifact trope through specific world logic.</comment>
