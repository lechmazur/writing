<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids diagnostic labels; "somber marvel" embodies professional awe. Micro-choices like turning the chain link reveal hierarchy of values (tradition vs. cosmic navigation). Slight over-articulation in final realization risks mid-crisis clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "depth and distance are illusions" reweights reality through the chain link's final tactile resonance. Accumulative/textural lens holds—stellar radiation discovery tightens options without causal cause-effect. Orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Chain link (tool) constrains choices as dual-purpose compass and charges the final image. Water pressure micro-setting enables navigation method—stellar radiation in "molecular bonds" isn't decorative but causal. Bioluminescent city details filter through navigation instructor's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning alien navigation) signaled immediately. Deepening via stellar radiation in water forecloses old methods with felt cost in "transforming understanding." Agency entirely Elara's—her teaching choices drive every revelation. Torres' curiosity accent deepens but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chain link resonance: "navigating by stars within" reweights "unfolded horizons" without moralizing. Final image ("depths that held stars") offers non-literal answer to cosmic connection. Avoids thematic echo—alien's line is discovery, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes: navigation instructor notices topology, pressure gradients. Lexicon ("edge geometry," "molecular bonds") stays within plausible expertise. Alien dialogue's whale-song rhythm distinct from human cadence. Stress compression ("hurt to look at directly") feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "crushing darkness" reused purposefully. Sentence rhythm varies ("She entered..." vs. "The benthic city hummed..."). Technical terms ("emission spectrum") precise. Final line avoids cliché through concrete physics: "depths that held stars."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "aliens teach humans" trope via oceanic lens—"stars within" is fresh inflection. Specific detail (chain link etched with star charts) avoids abstraction. Conceptual integrity: follows implications of "edge geometry" to cosmic scale without retreat.</comment>
