<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "movements both heavy with memory and light with possibility," but "glass remembers heat" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting embodied emotion under pressure during the couple's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: handing the warm sphere crystallizes "safety is crafted," with cost legible in her voice's "weight of years and lightness of possibility," under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned control room actively constrains choices—sweeping debris, placing spheres near the shutdown button—and the glassblowing tools charge the final image as "safe vessels," satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sphere accumulation narrowing options, but "safety" remains abstract; visceral cost (e.g., physical toll of glassblowing) would strengthen escalation beyond conceptual weight in the final exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from glass/ice duality, with the final "fragile began to grow" reweighting disaster into curiosity, though "patience preventing hearts from shattering" flirts with abstraction, narrowly avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust rises... former certainty dancing") and rhythmic control during high-pressure glassblowing beats showcase masterful focalization, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ice dripped steadily from broken ceiling tiles" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "symphony of running water" slightly verges on cliché without sufficient texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of nuclear trauma through glassblowing craft feels inevitable, but "thawing heart" metaphor risks familiarity, slightly diminishing the bold risk of Accumulative structure heightening emotional stakes.</comment>
