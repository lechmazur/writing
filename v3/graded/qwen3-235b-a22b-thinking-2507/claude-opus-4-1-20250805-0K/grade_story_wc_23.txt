<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory impulses—her own migratory pull versus duty—act simultaneously in the cranking sequences, with the brother's call crystallizing her renunciation. Micro-choices like salt-in-pocket instructions reveal a hierarchy of values paid in physical cost: "fingers stiff from gripping it through the night."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably when Marina releases the bronze foot, her "raw certainty" crystallizing with visible cost: new scratches on the artifact and depleted strength. The Accumulative lens holds through each call’s pressure accumulation, with the brother’s sulfur fields call intensifying stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The patina bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (lever for cranking) and charges the final image ("warm as a living thing" in her lap). Sensory specificity—like toxins "settling lower at night"—anchors urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina’s agency under Accumulative pressure: the child’s call tightens emotional stakes, then Diego’s sulfur fields call forces her to deploy personal knowledge ("I walked it myself"), narrowing options to word-building alone. Cost is legible in her violent tremors during the final crank.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions ("build bridges from words") not moralizing; the final image reweights the censer foot from relic to active tool, answering the central question without abstraction. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "geography of loss" in satellite-shadow navigation tactics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress-distorted details: "cells sang with terrible longing" and "toxins settle lower at night" reflect her migratory biology. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—shortening to fragments ("Dawn approached. Marina released...") during exhaustion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density propulsion in peak beats ("She pressed the bronze foot... The array groaned, shifted an inch"). Final line’s "build bridges from words" crystallizes theme without figurative muddle, while "patina bronze" and "sulfur fields" avoid generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moon-phases and radio navigation transforms migration tropes; specific tactics (salt in pocket, satellite shadows) avoid abstraction. Emotional truth in duty/longing conflict elevates beyond surface novelty, though "some of us are meant to stay" borders slightly on thematic hedging.</comment>
