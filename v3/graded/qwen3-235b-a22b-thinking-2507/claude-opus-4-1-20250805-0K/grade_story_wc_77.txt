<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (repulsion vs fascination) drives choices, but "formaldehyde" metaphor borders on clinical abstraction during peak realization, slightly diluting embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands with visceral cost (clasp transformation), causal chain unbroken from clasp theft to Fear's dissolution; disorientation (Cornelius' nature) pays off precisely at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mold and opera clasp function as micro-setting, constraining Mara's choices and charging the final image with "ruby eye closed, satisfied" reweighting decay as containment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency (reading notes backward), not coincidence; cost is legible in the clasp's shifted imagery, though Fear's "lonely" motivation slightly softens the moral calculus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through clasp's evolving images—no moralizing, only resonant CR as "repulsive allure" transforms into controlled power; avoids thematic echo by showing Fear's need rather than stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stomach turn with fascination," "silk through broken glass") modulates under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during confrontation with Fear-child.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "photographically cursed" gains specificity through "children's screams on loop," though "formaldehyde" metaphor risks clinical tone in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms fear trope via loneliness rather than monstrosity; opera clasp's memory-photographing function is irreplaceable, synthesizing setting and theme through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
