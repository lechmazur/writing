<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s professional armor vs. trembling confession; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak ("hand trembled," "dissolve like salt"). Final choice earned by micro-choices under pressure, but Marcus backstory lacks friction beyond regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("walls began to dissolve") under Accumulative lens; confessions accumulate density until Mara’s etching reconfigures stakes. Orientation clear by 40 words; lens consistent through resonant hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting: phosphorescence guides Mara’s perception, hairline fractures charge final image with "veins of hope." Constrained choice via shell’s spiral etching, but Mount Erebus specificity lacks causal pressure beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake crystallizes through confessions ("terrified of living above ground"), escalating via Mara’s agency under Accumulative lens. Visible cost in structural compromise mark and emotional shift; "heartbeat of hesitation" tightens decision without coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through confessions’ transformation—not moralized but charged by final image ("walls between hearts would grow thin"). Avoids Thematic Echo; "real apocalypse is distance" earns resonance via prior particulars, though Marcus thread risks secondary stake dilution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters caves through inspector’s lens ("structural integrity compromised"), with syntax tightening during crisis ("knife point found purchase"). No dialogue, but internal voice modulates from clinical to vulnerable without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("latent radiance that seemed to breathe with the cave itself" advances plot/theme). Final line’s "ready to speak" avoids closure muddle; figurative language ("constellation of reflected possibilities") earns payoff without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: doomsday prep refracted through emotional isolation. Conch-shell confessions transform trope via specific mechanics; risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Cultivation chamber" redefinition feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
