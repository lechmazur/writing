<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (shadows as weapon vs bridge) drives choice; embodied change via apple's taste shows cost. Motivation clear but could deepen prior stake investment beyond keeper's dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "juice ran sweet with courage to see others completely" reweights empathy's price. Accumulative lens holds through mirror revelations tightening Mira's stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse orchard constrains choice (navigating mirrors) and charges final image (apple seeds as transformation). Ice floes' physical threat makes "warmth generates from understanding" a causal environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early via merchant's shattered ambition; escalation through mirror glimpses narrows Mira's path to either reject truth or transform. Cost visible in her physical reaction to tasting forgiveness's courage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirror fragments (child forgiving father, soldier choosing mercy) without moralizing. Final image of seeds reweights "impossibility and necessity" as non-literal answer, though "tyrant's nightmare" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "emotional architecture" and shadow-woven uniform rippling. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("autumn sunshine and forgiveness") to taut during merchant's truth revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "juice ran sweet with courage to see others completely" conveys embodied cost. Final line's "impossibility and necessity" recharges premise without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms empathy trope via specific mechanics: mirrors reconstituting shattered denial into teaching tools. Risk-taking in quiet closure charges stakes without gimmickry, though merchant's backstory lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
