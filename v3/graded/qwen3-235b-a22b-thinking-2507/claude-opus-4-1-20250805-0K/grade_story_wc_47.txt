<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied through micro-choices (silencing phone, proffering moss) avoiding therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (privacy vs connection) crystallize in Marcus's arrival with visible cost in trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "yesterday" viral confession remains temporally unanchored past 120 words, triggering −0.4 penalty; Accumulative/Textural closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost via spreading moss pattern but orientation flaw caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Server racks actively constrain choices (cooling systems channeling rainwater, generators housing seedlings); moss patterns charge final image as "richest soil," transforming environment into tactical necessity rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure deepens through Marcus's intrusion—Kira's sanctuary invasion crystallizes stance without reversal; viral timeframe tightens tactics as "honeyed hush" becomes contested space with felt cost in her "protected vulnerability" modulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through moss’s "circles of darker green" reweighted as "richest soil" in final image; no moralizing—conceptual repricing ("marks become soil") answers central question through tangible growth, avoiding abstract binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: tech-meets-nature lexicon ("living tapestries," "cascading gardens") reflects Kira’s engineer-gardener duality; dialogue indirection ("Teach me?") carries subtext without ventriloquism, modulating under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scaffold in "quietly proactive" telling mid-beat (−0.2); otherwise pristine propulsion—"melting icicles left peculiar pattern" compresses backstory while advancing present stakes via moss’s drinking rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech decay and organic healing avoids tropes; risk-taking in "server room as breathing space" commits fully to premise, with moss patterns charging closure without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
