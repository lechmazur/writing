<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Child's motivation rooted in grandfather's photo creates embodied contradiction (preserving possibility vs. erasing pain); Merrick's micro-choices (selecting sharp incisors, using moonlight as guide) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in transformed inventory. No diagnostic labels; flaws (isolated vendor) compound organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation clear by 78 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (library trembling → apples filling with new light). Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost: "where once bottles of forgetting stood, now vessels of perpetual beginning" reconfigures Merrick's entire purpose with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glass droplets quantifying absence function as micro-setting that constrains choice (Merrick's method for understanding customers) and charges final image (eternal openings). Recurring apples evolve from "crystalline leaves" to vessels holding "stories that would never have to end," directly shaping closure's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake signaled immediately ("forget how stories end"); escalation driven by Merrick's agency (choosing incisors over gentle tools, guided by moonlight) narrows options to irreversible transformation. Cost unmistakable: shop's inventory reconfiguration forces Merrick's epiphany that some shops exist "to transform what cannot be sold."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of "vessels of perpetual beginning" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question (where stories begin/end), reweighting prior material through concrete particulars ("like her grandfather's mouth, forever about to reveal"). Avoids moralizing; thematic complexity emerges from child's photo and Merrick's quantified voids.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quantifying absence by spaces between droplets") and rhythmic control under pressure ("silence expanded between them like breath held too long"). Dialogue carries subtext (child's "maybe they never have to" reveals deeper fear) while Merrick's lexicon reflects vendor precision ("30ml," "incise carefully").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("bottled moonlight from the night the world's first story was told" compresses lore into propulsion). Final cadence shift ("sun began to set. Or perhaps it was rising") crystallizes theme without figurative muddle. "Mindfully scattered time" exemplifies textural specificity replacing abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "forgetting" trope into preserving possibility through specific logic (endings woven through heartbeats). Risk-taking heightens stakes: lyric accumulation of glass/cloud imagery makes Earned Stasis closure inevitable. "Parole" concept avoids abstraction via concrete moonlight vessel that charges transformation.</comment>
