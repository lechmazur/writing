<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vex's immortal weariness and contradictory impulses (stagnation vs transformation) drive micro-choices like fragment placement; Thorne's crew lacks interiority despite thematic pressure, costing 0.3.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "leaving the prismatic escondite empty" crystallizes eternal existence foreclosed; Hybrid lens (causal fusion + accumulative storm pressure) holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite actively constrains choices (magnetic window creation), but solar storm remains atmospheric rather than tactically pressuring; "translucent barriers" specificity charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Vex's agency: amulet fusion narrows options to transcendence or stagnation; "true death existed only beyond" deepens knowledge with visceral cost in the departure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Curses are just possibilities they're afraid of" avoids moralizing; final image of "light bending through impossible angles" offers resonant non-literal answer to immortality's prison without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("obsidian surface drinking light") and rhythmic control under pressure; dimensional awareness filters all description; no head-hopping despite multi-POV window.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("voice carrying weight of hushed thunder") with clear propulsion; "swimmers through heavy water" risks mixed metaphor but doesn't muddle closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms immortality trope through dimensional prison logic; "prison not gift" synthesis feels inevitable, but solar storm framing lacks fresh inflection to breach 9.0.</comment>
