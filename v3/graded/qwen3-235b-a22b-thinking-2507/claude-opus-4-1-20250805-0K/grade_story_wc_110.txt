<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through micro-choices ("spread them on wet stone"), embodied emotion ("relief... spring rain after winter"). Contradictory impulses (protecting Marcus vs. honesty) drive closure. Slight over-neatness in emotional resolution prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("mistrust hadn't vanished but begun to thaw"). Accumulative lens held perfectly: sensory density (puddles→lens→breath) tightens pressure toward Charged Poise. Final image reweights "ambiguously clear" with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Forecourt constrains choice (acoustics force whispers, rain enables lens reflections) and charges final image ("lens gathering rain/moonlight"). Micro-setting (projector lens) evolves from prop to closure symbol. Environment actively shapes every beat without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately ("weighted with what remained unspoken"). Pressure escalates via Mira's eavesdropping admission—a protagonist-driven deepening that narrows options. Cost is visceral in "relief... spring rain after winter" and the tangible "thaw" of mistrust.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "ambiguously clear" doodles to lens metaphor; final image reweights premise without moralizing. "Clarity and distortion same gift" offers resonant non-literal answer. Zero thematic echo—insights earned through concrete particulars (doodles, lens, breath).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("puddle a mirror to questions," "quartz pillars sang"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: staccato during confession ("Mira—" / "We were both..."), fluid in resolution. Zero register drift; dialogue indirection carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "transparency demanded its due" compresses theme into action. Final line achieves maximum density ("breathing became music"). Minor deduction for "spring rain after winter" slightly over-familiar, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: museum acoustics as emotional conduit, "ambiguously clear" as active philosophy. Lens metaphor transforms stock reconciliation trope through specific physics (refraction). Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
