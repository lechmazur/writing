<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "imperfect smile" after guiding Thomas to embrace flaws; embodied emotion in her off-key humming and tactile tooth-checking avoids therapy-speak. Thomas's "afraid imperfection meant worthlessness" confession earns his change through specific harp-struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands with undeniable cost: Thomas dissolving into light after realizing "imperfection meant worthlessness" forecloses his fear path. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the gorge's echo pressure tightens via sensory density until sunrise reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge constrains every choice: amplifying whispers to screams forces Mara's quiet approach, while the crocodile's tooth (warming/cooling) directly charges the final image. Sunrise's "hidden" quality creates tangible time pressure for the harp's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: distorted harp notes deepen into "weeping made of music," narrowing Thomas's options until Mara's off-key humming creates the only viable path. Cost is visceral—"afraid imperfection meant worthlessness" crystallizes the emotional price paid at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through harp mechanics: "broken and beautiful" melody rejects perfectionism without moralizing. Final image of "laughter in warming air" reweights sorrow through action, though Thomas's near-thesis ("afraid imperfection meant worthlessness") edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "hushed minutes before dawn" sensory filtering; voice modulates from spectral ("confessions whispered against it") to tactile ("modestly fearless in practiced steps"). No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via gorge's echo mechanics pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "weeping made of music" compresses emotion without muddle. "Bronze the eastern wall" and "cathedral of gold" deploy precise imagery that advances stakes. Final line’s "imperfect and eternal" recharges the harp motif with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms soul-collector trope through tactile specificity: tooth's warmth guides choices, misaligned harp enables healing. Risk-taking in lyrical compression ("laughter made of music") heightens stakes coherently, though "luminous ache" leans familiar without full freshness.</comment>
