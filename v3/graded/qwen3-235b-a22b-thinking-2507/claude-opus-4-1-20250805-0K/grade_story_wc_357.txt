<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (Council duty vs Verdance's truth), but epiphany lacks micro-choice friction in climax; embodied emotion strong though "dancing with it" realization edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: gravity restoration crystallizes "dancing with change" with undeniable conceptual cost; Causal lens holds from water navigation to monument activation without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Upward water flows and whirling silence constrain choices (navigation method) and charge final image; micro-setting triumph as arrow tip's warmth directly enables climax's light eruption.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kessa's agency: choosing "up" path and pressing arrow tip narrow options; Inversion's live clock creates visible cost in temporary plant growth collapse, reweighting colony survival stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from water/echoes as "dancing with change," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights resilience through Verdance's defiance without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water flows skyward," "vortexes of noise") modulates under pressure; minor register drift in climax ("seeds of true understanding" borders on abstraction) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts but "whirling silence" paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 (-0.2); lyrical density peaks during Inversion ("leaves continued photosynthesis") with precise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms inversion trope through orchard pilot lens; risk-taking (gravity-flip ecology) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional truth in "temporary growth" tradeoff.</comment>
