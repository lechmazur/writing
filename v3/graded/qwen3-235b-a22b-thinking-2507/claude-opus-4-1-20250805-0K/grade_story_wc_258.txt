<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shown through micro-choices like card placement; "steadily curious" trait drives her Jakarta tracking with embodied cost in the final "43 days" commitment. Marcus's skepticism provides secondary pressure that crystallizes her stance without flattening her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise when Vera corrects Marcus to "forty-three days," crystallizing her endurance with conceptual cost: value resides in connection patterns, not coins. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—card/tape density builds to this irreversible stance shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Measuring tape constrains choices (algorithmic intervals dictate card placement) and charges the final image when rolled up, reweighting digital evolution. Rain-beaded skylight evolves from atmospheric detail to "flowing river" during revelation, mirroring the archive's fluid persistence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Vera's agency: Marcus's "why those intervals?" question forces her confide moment, deepening knowledge to prove the Jakarta archive. Cost is legible in her final commitment to honor the rhythm—a tangible forfeiture of casual tracking for disciplined preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: cards reveal "value isn't stored in coins... but patterns of connection." Final rain-droplet image reweights prior material as "tiny lenses focused on the future," avoiding moralizing while crystallizing digital persistence as human truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vera's perceptual signature shines: she notices "algorithmic intervals" and UV-reactive ink, not generic details. Voice modulates perfectly—clinical precision during card layout shifts to rhythmic urgency in "multiplying paths" spiral. Marcus's academic lexicon ("cultural anthropologist") contrasts her tactile focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story: "measuring tape coiled like a sleeping snake" establishes profession and tension. Final line recharges opening ruins imagery with "mapping tomorrow's migrations," achieving high density without muddling the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms crypto crash trope through Jakarta's distributed archive. Specifics like 43-day cycles and carbonized ink feel lived-in, not quirky. Risk-taking—making digital migration tangible via physical cards—heightens stakes without gimmickry, as closure proves value in human connections.</comment>
