<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: her "senseless perception" manifests in noticing life "between violence," driving micro-choices like not hurrying to preserve roses' "meditation." Final shift earned through years of cultivation work, with visible cost in father's weapon sheathing as "learning a new language."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "we grow anyway" crystallizes stakes through action, not exposition. Accumulative lens holds—density of quiet moments builds to the seed-planting reconfiguration where pacifism becomes active strength. Cost proof: "trying to give it something—perhaps an apology" makes price undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass dome functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (Mira's "practiced silence" to avoid disturbing roses' meditation) and charges the final image ("impossible garden"). Sandbag scrap's coarse texture enabling "delicate work" exemplifies object-as-setting that shapes the climax's seed-planting ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural deepening: father's bloodied return intensifies the "harsh world beyond the dome" pressure, but his kneeling at the crimson rose ("This one knows your story") reweights options via Mira's agency. Cost is unmistakable in his weapon sheathing—a physical reconfiguration of their relationship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "engraved quiet" isn't stated but shown via her palm-pressing soil and whispering values. Final image ("something else rose") offers resonant answer to "how to persist after trauma" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through earned action ("we grow anyway").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "spaces between violence where life persisted," with syntax modulating from lyrical ("geometric patterns across the desert rose farm") to clipped ("Complete.") during father's return. Zero head-hopping; her lexicon ("senseless perception") stays character-particular under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—sentences like "She didn't merely water them; she taught them" drive propulsion with high density. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle: weapon sheathing as "deliberate care of someone learning a new language" crystallizes change without abstraction. Final line’s "quiet revolution" charges closure with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms tropes: pacifism as active cultivation ("weave continuity through chaos") feels inevitable through desert roses' "gentle insistence." Risk-taking elevates stakes—quiet climax without confrontation deepens emotional truth, with "engraved quiet" method offering non-obvious resilience logic that reshapes bounty hunter dynamics.</comment>
