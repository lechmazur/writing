<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through concrete micro-choices (keeping the tile, transcribing whale songs), but "courageously kind" phrase borders on thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost ("years trying to separate... when should have been integrating"), but the Accumulative lens isn't named early enough; ambiguity persists until midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tower functions as micro-setting (stone vibrations, tile warmth constrain choices), but environmental details rarely pressure tactics beyond atmospheric resonance in the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elena's transcription agency under Accumulative lens, but the three-day migration timeframe lacks live-clock pressure; cost is felt but not tactically leveraged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (transcription as integration), with final image reweighting "space between certainty and wonder" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo through earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct astronomer POV signature shines in sensory selection ("mathematical progression," "stellar silence"), but "unheard symphony" phrasing slightly elevates register beyond Elena's empiricist lexicon during peak realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in closure beat ("The tower would remain... but now it would also be...") dulls final image; otherwise high density with clean rhythm, but artifact touches ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of science/mysticism through transcription methodology; emotional specificity in "entangled memories" reframing avoids tropes, with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
