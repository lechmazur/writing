<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s abandonment of chest bindings earns change through embodied contradiction (safety vs. authenticity), with Torven’s vulnerability revealing shared flaw; no label-speak, only tactile choices like trembling fingers evading Torven’s grasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (abandoned clothes on rocks) under Hybrid lens; island emergence reweights Pacification’s meaning via scrimshaw’s activation, though whale-call mechanics slightly underdeveloped in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: kelp forests and bioluminescent surf constrain Mira’s unwrapping choice and charge the final image; whalebone scrimshaw’s warmth directly enables Cetacea’s emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom through truth) tightens via Torven’s arrival forcing Mira’s choice; cost legible in binding removal, but whale’s call resolves stakes it barely shaped earlier, slightly undercutting agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through abandoned dock clothes and scrimshaw’s warmth—not moralizing; final image reweights Pacification as internal transformation ("authentic souls had no need for violence"), avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in water/tide metaphors ("moved like water," "slipped away like tide") and dock-specific details; voice modulates from gritty labor to lyrical whale-song without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("muscles locking in painful rebellion" compresses Pacification’s cost), though "combative tenderness" slightly echoes earlier phrasing; no figurative muddle in peak unwrapping beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Pacification as biological imperative + island as internal state; specificity (binding chest, Torven’s grandfather’s journal) avoids tropes, with risk-taking in making violence cessation a backdrop for identity liberation.</comment>
