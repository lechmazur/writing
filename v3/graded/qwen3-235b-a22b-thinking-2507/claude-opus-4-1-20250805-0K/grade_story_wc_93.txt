<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Yann’s interior contradiction—seeing but not controlling the future—drives authentic micro-choices (stone placement) with embodied cost ("trapped between knowing and doing"). Final renunciation of her "curse" as foresight earns through revelation, though her transition to purpose lacks one visceral stumble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Yann’s new stone placement crystallizes her burden-to-purpose shift, foreclosing passive endurance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density escalation (aurora, dust, eels converging), though lens inference delays until the thirteenth stone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff’s micro-setting constrains choice (rocks placed on edge) and charges closure (pouch warmth against hip as she begins anew). Star dust and stones function as essential tools, though water’s tactile presence could heighten constraint during eel emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding patterns) deepens through revelation-driven escalation, narrowing Yann’s options from herding to guardianship. Agency shines as she actively creates the apprentice’s pattern, with cost legible in "tend these patterns through borrowed dawns"—a quiet endurance with cosmic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: eels as friction’s guardians reweight the premise without moralizing. The final stone placement offers resonant, non-literal answer to "what moves in the spaces between," avoiding thematic echo while charging the closure with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("borrowed dawn," "spaces between what moves") modulates rhythm under pressure, compressing diction during precognition flashes. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly disrupts Yann’s voice during revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via precise verbs ("writhed," "pulsed") and varied syntax. One near-duplicate ("neither true sunrise nor honest darkness" / "shades that belonged to neither night nor day") risks redundancy but serves atmospheric density without dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi and myth ("eel herder of the Frictionless Age") avoids tropes through specific logic (Fibonacci sequences as universe’s memory). Emotional truth in Yann’s burden-to-purpose arc elevates risk, though "guardians" concept slightly echoes familiar archetypes.</comment>
