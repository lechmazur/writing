<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("screaming tenderness") and embodied emotion avoid therapy-speak; micro-choices (uncorking, beckoning) reveal values under pressure. Slight tell in "three years alone" backstory reduces score from 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (two shadows dancing) crystallizes reconfiguration with undeniable cost ("real enough to hold, real enough to love"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; cost proof evident in the fallen cork's significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse constrains choice (spiral ascent) and charges final image; the stone's "ancient pulse" and beam actively shape tactics. Micro-setting (vial cork) evolves to symbolize release, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately through "Come back to me"; one deepening (guilt as prison) narrows options. Mara's agency drives escalation via purified intentions, with visible cost in Thomas's fragile solidity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "screaming tenderness" reframing love as active struggle; final image answers central question without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via physical details ("gentle violence of refusing to let go").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices textures (warm cork), scents, light distortions. Rhythm modulates from slow dawn to urgent compression ("Please," she whispered). Zero POV leakage under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "bruise healing into gold" avoids cliché with fresh metaphor. High density: "vibrations of intent... manifest memory into molecules" does triple duty. Climax prose ("jasmine scent exploded") remains clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via "intentions as tangible" concept; "screaming tenderness" reframes grief as active purification. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ synthesis test.</comment>
