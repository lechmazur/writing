<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete perception ("pentimento shadows," "indigo stains") but core motivation ("honor overlooked histories") lacks visceral urgency until Valdric's revelation; grandmother's legacy provides sufficient contradiction in "spaces between" identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mira descending with transformed painting forecloses passive observation with felt cost ("carried permission to unfasten"), while "eternal instant" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens through layered time.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Paint layers function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (knife work following intuition) and charges the final image; lighthouse foundation stone marked by painted-only constellation perfectly embodies environment-as-closure-driver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstractly historical rather than viscerally immediate; pressure accumulates beautifully through paint revelations but lacks tangible consequence for failure beyond intellectual loss under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "crystalline light that shouldn't exist" to "stories dance in droplets," with grandmother's wisdom ("too precious for museums") reweighted by the fog projection climax—zero thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: Mira filters reality through translation ("read the spaces between," "coordinates in light-patterns"); rhythm shifts from market cacophony to lyrical revelation without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pentimento shadows bleeding through" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overuse of "eternal instant" (3x) in final beats barely prevents 9.5, but closure image ("rippled outward") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden artifact" trope through linguistic anthropology—encoding stories in light refractions feels inevitable, not clever. Risk-taking (paint as historical record) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
