<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's motivation as artist is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; childhood pebble detail informs action yet doesn't create present-tense tension. "Forgiveness costs the confessor most" reveals depth but the epiphany about "fractured complexity" feels unearned without visible struggle against her own fears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: pressure builds through voice density until the canyon's "forged hush broke apart like ice." Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "The Silencers would not forgive her for this," crystallizing the stakes without physical confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bone towers actively constrain choices—acoustics refract truth into resistance, making environment causal. Final image ("transmitter of possibilities") charges the setting, fulfilling the 9+ gate where recurring objects reweight the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kira's agency: her poetry spreads "like flame," multiplying truths as Silencers approach. Cost is unmistakable in the final standoff, but escalation lacks a persistent constraint (e.g., physical exhaustion) shaping tactics beyond the setting's inherent properties.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; theme emerges through "truth, like light through water" refracting organically. Final image reweights "price of forgiveness" from abstract concept to lived resistance, offering non-literal resolution without stated morals—textbook 9+ thematic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "bone rose like accusations" and rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences as boots approach). Minor register drift in "impromptu poetry session" slightly jars the voice during high-stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "scatter into music" shows rather than tells, with zero loops. Only microscopic issue—"spread through the towers like flame through dry kindling" slightly over-ornaments a pivotal beat, preventing 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "truth as light" trope through specific bone-tower acoustics; emotional truth in "forgiveness costs the confessor most" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry, meeting 9+ quick test with inevitable synthesis.</comment>
