<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s fault-tolerant oracle trait manifests in embodied contradictions (truths "swaying like prayer flags"), not abstract labels. Her micro-choice to smudge her signature—prioritizing protection over recognition—crystallizes her arc with visceral cost ("weight of swallowed truth in her chest like a second, wiser heart").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: Mira’s marginal existence culminates in taping the smudged illustration, reconfiguring truth’s survival with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds via sensory density (aurora’s "intimate sorrow"), not causal turns, with cost legible in the final heartbeat metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mountain station micro-setting constrains every choice (sleeping in supply closet, magnetometer calibration), while the botanical illustration charges closure as a recurring object. Final image—aurora-light on petals—reweights truth’s weight through environment, avoiding generic symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (truth’s survival in margins) tighten through Mira’s agency: calibrating the magnetometer, drawing the flower. Escalation under Accumulative lens peaks with aurora’s arrival, narrowing options to smudging/protecting. Cost is unmistakable: carrying "nothing and everything" in her chest, altering her descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts—smudging signatures, marginal existence—not abstraction. Final image (illustration taped to window) resonates as a non-literal answer: truths thrive in electromagnetic sorrow, reweighting "fault-tolerance" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; sorrow is embodied, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: oracle’s "frost-numbed fingers" and "altitude sickness" metaphors filter all observation. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Night fell with particular weight") avoids uniformity. Compression taught early (fever dreams) pays off in closure’s crystalline quiet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "truth of it rushed through her like altitude sickness" merges emotion, metaphor, and character). Figurative language ("grief made visible") sharpens pressure without muddle. Final line’s cadence crystallizes the conceptual cost flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specificity: "fault-tolerant oracle" grounded in weather-station marginalia, auroral sorrow as electromagnetic truth. Emotional authenticity in Mira’s quiet endurance avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (closure as Charged Poise) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
