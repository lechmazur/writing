<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("heart hammered rhythms") and micro-choices under pressure, but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet psychologically underdeveloped despite seven-year backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("Kova stood changed"), Accumulative lens held through density escalation. Slight BRR violation: "seven years" reflection summarizes without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as essential micro-setting constraining choices (bare feet in "spaces between feelings"), but spatial choreography blurs during climax ("prowling cat made of departed music" lacks tactile anchors).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through constellation pressure driving agency (zigzag casting), but reflection fragment weakens causality; cost legible yet preparation summary dilutes escalation's visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through final whisper ("some songs never die") and winter blooms; avoids moralizing while reweighting premise via conceptual cost—no thematic echo, pure resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("constellations moved in their sleep") with rhythmic control, but "voicing silence" concept introduces abstraction in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless density and propulsion; minor figurative muddle in "feral lullabies that made frequencies shiver" (sound can't shiver) but no closure impact. Zero scaffold in critical beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-physicality avoids magical realism tropes; rail spike innovation transforms "straight lines" into thematic constraint. Risk-taking (voicing silence) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
