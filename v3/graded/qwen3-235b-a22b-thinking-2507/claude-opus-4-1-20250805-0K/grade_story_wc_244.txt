<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sadie’s embodied contradiction—jocular mask slipping to reveal depth—drives the transaction’s cost. Marcus’s motivation crystallizes through the phone trade, but Sadie’s interiority relies slightly on told backstory ("seventeen floods") rather than fully shown struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Marcus holding the phone crystallizes his transformed purpose with undeniable cost ("loneliest people aren’t the victims"). Accumulative lens holds as details accumulate toward this reconfiguration; only minor thematic echo in final line slightly dampens cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-covered station functions as micro-setting that pressures choices (Sadie emerging from shadows) and charges the final image ("ivy whispered agreements"). Moon rock and satellite phone constrain actions, though station’s history risks slight exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (loneliness vs. purpose) tighten when Sadie reveals the phone’s true function, forcing Marcus’s choice. Escalation driven by Sadie’s agency (rumor chain setup), but "cure for loneliness" line borders on thematic echo, slightly softening cost clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete transaction ("reciprocity isn’t charity"), avoiding direct statement. Final image reweights reciprocity as "economy of human need," but Sadie’s last line risks thematic echo though saved by character voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice distinctiveness shines: Sadie’s "desperately jocular" rhythm ("raccoons are union now") contrasts Marcus’s earnestness. Prose modulates under pressure—accelerating in dialogue, slowing for reflection—without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "thermos like a peace offering" advances setting, character, and tension simultaneously. Minor deduction for "desperately jocular edge" repeating trait label, but no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms disaster-relief tropes via specific mechanics (Malaysian coffee rumor, moon rock purification). "Polite anarchy" concept feels inevitable yet fresh, though loneliness theme slightly familiar—elevated by concrete transactions over sentimentality.</comment>
