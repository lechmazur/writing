<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during crisis; Mira's realization feels inevitable without visible struggle between options. Interiority shows embodied emotion ("world tilted") but no layered resistance to accepting paradox as solution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: "Quantum Folklore" classification reweights reality rules with undeniable conceptual cost ("Council of Empirical Facades"). Monsoon's approach and glowing seed make cost viscerally legible while holding Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost orchids function as micro-setting that constrains choice (deadline) and charges final image (petals reflecting stories). Ridge bloom's seven-year cycle creates tangible pressure while "empirically whimsical" seed physically manifests the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Escalation driven by Mira's agency: swallowing seed → encountering contradictions → reframing truth. Monsoon deadline creates irreversible pressure; cost is unmistakable in "purple lightning tracing horizon" and Council's challenge to her classification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: contradictory myths ("sleeping giant" vs "cosmic serpent") and shifting island names embody "luminous doubt." Final line ("what could be more real than stories...") resonates without moralizing, reweighting the premise through earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "petals translucent as forgotten names," "laughter recorded on seismographs." Under monsoon pressure, syntax tightens ("Show me truth," "The world tilted") while maintaining lyrical precision without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "pulsed with an empirically whimsical warmth—measurable yet inexplicable" compresses concept into rhythm. Minor repetition of "luminous doubt" (three uses) borders on scaffold but deepens meaning each time.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Quantum Folklore" transforms cliché through specific cultural mechanics (riddles, starlight tea). Risk-taking elevates stakes: centering survival on narrative multiplicity feels inevitable in hindsight yet fresh, with emotional truth in "truth nonetheless—luminous in its doubt."</comment>
