<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lacks layered emotional contradiction during crisis; "quietly deliberate" trait shows control but insufficient internal struggle against the universe's weight despite high stakes. Final renunciation of ignorance as safety feels earned through causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "learning not what runes could do, but what they must never be allowed to do again" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Causal lens holds impeccably through loop-closing mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Floating observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (telescopes reveal void coordinates) and charges final image ("shadows would have nowhere left to go but exactly where they belonged"). Tool (key) directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lyra's agency under causal lens: noon's approach tightens options as shadows flee, forcing her to reinterpret runes. Cost is unmistakable in the burden of guardianship crystallized at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sealed awakenings' mechanics rather than moralizing; final image reweights runes' purpose as containment without stating a thesis. Avoids sentimentality by grounding "nightmares" in concrete loop-closing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in rune/physics-focused noticing ("shadows that fell upward at noon"). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("tracing runes in the air" vs. opening's deliberate climb).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; "loops closed with a whisper that sounded almost like relief" achieves high density without muddle. Slight cadence uniformity in mid-beat ("brass gears meshed... silver threads connected") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and mundane objects (spoons) avoids trope recycling. Risk-taking in Spoon Convergence premise heightens stakes coherently, with runes' inverted logic feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
