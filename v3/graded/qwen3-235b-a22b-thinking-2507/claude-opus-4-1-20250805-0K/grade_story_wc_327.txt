<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "needed that curse now" versus inherent risk, but micro-choices lack visible cost escalation during the diamond activation; the final transformation feels inevitable without struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "her veins finally cooled" crystallizes the cost, while starlings dispersing reconfigures language preservation. Accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition, though the dying speaker's off-page death slightly softens the cost's immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Copper veins constrain choice (carving towers) and charge the final image as canyon threads; bone towers' resonance directly enables the hybrid language. Sensory specificity ("dried lavender crumbling") masterfully embodies the core concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the diamond's curse activation and starling pattern shift, but escalation leans on external revelation (birds' gap) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The "final exhale" moment makes cost undeniable yet feels slightly detached from the canyon action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through texture-as-language ("silk dragged across bark"), avoiding moralizing. The copper-sealed diamond reweights loss as transformation without stating a thesis, though the "tunnel of echoes" concept risks near-allegorical clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "consonants softening like worn stone" filters urgency through tactile detail. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("starlings wheel against dying light") to precise ("angled the diamond") under pressure, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ten thousand extinct languages cascading" slightly overloads the diamond activation beat but pays off in the starling epiphany. Final line’s "languages not yet born" achieves crystalline propulsion without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "dying language" trope through texture-centric mechanics; copper veins as both tool and cost feels inevitable. Risk-taking in non-verbal translation heightens stakes, though canyon’s bone towers echo familiar mythic imagery.</comment>
