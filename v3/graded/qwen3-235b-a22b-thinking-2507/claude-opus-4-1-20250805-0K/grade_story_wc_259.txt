<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (purifying the plague) is concrete and consistent, with embodied emotion in memory absorption ("tears streamed down her face—not her tears"). Contradictory impulses (seeking forbidden knowledge to destroy it) drive the climax, though minimal backstory slightly limits depth within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "carrying ten thousand years of memory in her cells, forever changed" crystallizes the conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds as pressure tightens through memory absorption, with twilight-to-dawn timeframe anchoring stakes. No orientation issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bronze pagoda actively constrains choices (chaotic steps bypassing defenses) and charges closure as "empty" symbol. Twilight light evolves with action ("pulsing as she transformed"), while the saffron veil functions as micro-setting tool during purification. No generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira's agency: absorbing darker truths (tier 5 revelation) and shattering the vessel under guardian pressure. Cost is visceral ("memories fragment and recombine") and conceptual ("anguished joy" as transformed wisdom). Single tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "transmuting their civilization's end into a beginning" crystallized in Mira's exit, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "atoms of nostalgia" from treasure to warning without abstraction. Ethereans' flaws resist false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("impossible geometries that hurt to perceive") with rhythmic control under stress ("dancing—no, convulsing—no, transforming"). No POV slips; diction compresses appropriately during memory absorption while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "anguished joy" avoids cliché through precise context. High density: "atoms of nostalgia" simultaneously conveys concept, stakes, and theme. Final line ("purpose finally fulfilled") recharges pagoda motif without sentimentality. Minor redundancy in "recursively loops".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "crystallize memories" trope transformed via chaotic movement mechanics and purification-as-sacrifice. Emotional specificity ("texture of extinct fruit") avoids generic trauma. Bold risk in subverting hero tropes with self-destruction as redemption.</comment>
