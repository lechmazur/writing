<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sarai's embodied contradiction—weeping from "strange, cold warmth" while fitting tesserae—grounds her transformation. Micro-choices (pressing the stone, tracing patterns) reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels. Final renunciation of "restoration" earned through prior causality and visible cost ("minaret would remain fallen").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "the plaza would never recover its former glory" crystallizes irreversible loss while reconfiguring options. Accumulative lens holds through vision-density escalation; cost legible in "strong enough to hold the weight of transformation." Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tessera functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (vision triggers) and charging the final image ("placed her hand on another damaged stone"). Sensory details ("frost coating," "hot iron" sensation) evolve causally with emotional beats, avoiding static symbolism. Final starlight fracture image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative deepening: each vision narrows options (past trauma → future possibility) under Sarai's agency. Brotherhood threat intensifies pressure but resolves through stance crystallization, not coincidence. Cost unmistakable in "minaret would remain fallen" trade-off for new creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (renaming clay tablets, arranging tesserae), not moralizing. Final image—"refugees returning, building new homes from old stones"—reweights "aberrant mercy" as generative without stating a moral. Avoids false binaries; Brotherhood's view gains no false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "strange, cold warmth" and "shattered sky's strange light" filter reality through Sarai's retrocognitive lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure (fragmented visions vs. flowing climax). No head-hopping; free indirect style ("her curse—to witness...") maintains psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multitask ("The tessera gleamed crimson... warm despite the frost" establishes setting, object, and paradox). Figurative language ("embrace hot iron") remains coherent in high-pressure beats. Final line’s "fractures spreading starlight... like a promise" delivers closure propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms retrocognition trope through "invitation" reframing. "Aberrant mercy" gains freshness via specific stakes (renaming clay tablets, Brotherhood persecution). Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; final reconfiguration ("creating space for what comes next") grows organically from tessera mechanics.</comment>
