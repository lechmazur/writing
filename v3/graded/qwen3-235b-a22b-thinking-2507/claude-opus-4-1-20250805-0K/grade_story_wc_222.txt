<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Renn swaps secrets for questions, embodying "sacredly playful" through concrete micro-choices (crude wooden pieces vs master's ice). Slight underdevelopment in conflicting impulses during climax prevents 9.0 despite strong embodied motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the mirror reveals conceptual cost (loss of certainty) with the Keeper's eons-long laughter and "intentionally wrong" sky. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts, with cost legible in the spire's singing harmonies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Ice spire functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Renn feels starlight hum through palm during swap, and final image charges closure via "ice sang harmonies that had no names." Environment directly shapes tactics and reweights the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Renn's agency: swapping pieces transforms "certainty vs wonder" into visible cost (Keeper fading, sky's reconfiguration). Escalation driven by her choices under Accumulative lens, with conceptual price undeniable in the amended board's final state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through chess piece transformations; final line ("greatest treasure was not knowing") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction by rooting insights in concrete actions like the child's constellation drawing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("constellations swimming backward," "time itself confused") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; voice stays anchored in Renn's wonder-focused lexicon even during high-stakes swap sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "veils of frost" and "harmonies that had no names" exemplify textural specificity. Only minor density dip in master's backstory fragment (line 8), but strategic telling compresses transit without harming climax propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "apprentice vs master" trope through specific, grounded mechanics (hollow chess pieces as knowledge vessels). Emotional truth in Renn's thief philosophy feels fresh, with risk-taking (swapping answers for questions) heightening stakes coherently to closure.</comment>
