<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs curiosity) drive micro-choices like tracing condensation; "risk everything" line shows embodied cost without therapy-speak. Inspector's "my brother" revelation forces stance crystallization with visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: Margot's phrasebook reveal forecloses safe Commonwealth compliance. Causal lens holds perfectly—"condensation pattern → watershed theory → rivers flow outward" creates irreversible knowledge shift with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Condensation rivulets constrain discovery (validating watershed theory) and charge final image as "dendritic pattern" reappears on charts. Rusted desk isn't backdrop—it forces tactile engagement with maps, making micro-setting essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Margot's agency: Commonwealth duty vs truth-seeking. Condensation epiphany narrows options (rivers flow outward), forcing the "risk everything" choice with visible cost in her hand moving to the phrasebook.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "patience of buried water" resonates without moralizing. Final image of phrasebook-as-rosetta-stone reweights "singular convergence" as linguistic/hydrological harmony, avoiding thematic echo via earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartographer's eye for asymmetrical frost patterns and dendritic rivulets. Voice modulates from dry wit ("terrible weather") to technical precision under pressure, with falcon's "herald's gesture" showing subtext-rich dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "condensation formed rivulets that ran downward, branching and merging" does triple duty (image/plot/theme). Final line recharges "worrisome tranquility" motif with conceptual weight—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydrology and linguistics: phrasebook dog-ears transform from ornamental detail to discovery key. Emotional truth in "risk everything" avoids cliché; specificity (asymmetrical frost, rusted desk) grounds universal stakes.</comment>
