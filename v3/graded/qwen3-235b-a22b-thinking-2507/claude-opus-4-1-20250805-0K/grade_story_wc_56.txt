<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking external truths while avoiding personal lies) drives the closure choice; embodied emotion via weathered hands and "serene upheaval" avoids therapy-speak. Final decision to confront father earns cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "ready to dock" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost of confronting family lies. Accumulative lens holds—density increase in reflections narrows options to facing truth. Cost legible in "foundations we laid ourselves."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (sundial) constrains choice: its hidden compartment reveals confession, and bridge reflection creates "impossible shadow" charging the final image. Sensory details like "mirror-black water" filtered through Mara’s archaeological bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoiding personal deception) tightens through Mara’s realizations, narrowing options to running or confronting. Escalation driven by agency: opening the compartment forces the climax. Conceptual cost of complicity made undeniable in final reflection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: sundial inscription reweights from historical to personal. Ending offers non-literal answer ("greatest discovery... recognizing her own reflection") without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through embodied realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers read surfaces like braille") and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from measured ("thoughtfully clear moment") to urgent ("serene upheaval"). No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Mara’s POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding: "she'd been seeking" repetition is intentional echo, not loop. Propulsion via strong verbs ("drifted," "clicked open"). Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly jars POV lexicon in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "legend seeker" trope through specific moral calculus: chasing Van der Meer’s lies mirrors avoiding father’s sweatshops. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
