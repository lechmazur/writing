<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in dual nature ("analytically artistic") shown through concrete micro-choices like placing boot on crack and sketching the fortress. Slight abstraction in "unspoken truths" desire prevents 9.0 despite earned transformation from trembling to steady purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "tomorrow she would wake in her apartment, the drawing her only proof." Orientation perfect within 120 words; accumulative lens holds through mist-thickening and arrow progression to crystallized stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brass ticket punch (tool) constrains choice by parting mist and charges final image through sketching. Sensory specificity ("pavement hummed beneath her sole," "shadows in five directions") evolves with urgency while avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping unmappable vs. daylight reality) tightens through accumulative pressure: each arrow deepens disorientation until the fortress demands stance crystallization. Conceptual cost legible in trading documented world for "secret geography" with visible forfeiture of ordinary life.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "mysteries weren't meant to be solved but navigated" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image of backward-walking cartographer offers resonant answer to central question about truth's nature, avoiding sentimentality through "careful, impossible maps."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via cartographer's precision ("tracing cracks," "elegant geometry of intention"). Rhythmic control under pressure evident in fragmented clauses during spatial distortion ("buildings becoming suggestions rather than certainties") without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mist began to thicken with purpose" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting risk in "painful clarity" of stars redeemed by closure linkage when final sketch inherits that clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and emotional truth avoids trope recycling. "Fortress of unspoken truths" made visceral through shifting architecture of "confessions that died in throats," transforming familiar midnight quest via specific, character-driven logic.</comment>
