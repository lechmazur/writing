<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vera’s gold-seamed face embodies contradiction (healer/breaker), while Mira’s coin-clutching reveals visceral conflict between disappointment and inherited hope. Their choices—Vera’s vial-pouring, Mira’s cracked coin acceptance—earn the final smile through embodied stakes, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Mira’s realization ("wonder isn’t about being perfect") reweights identity with conceptual cost (ruined foundry, Vera’s scars). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density (rain, coin light) tightens toward crystallized stance without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Foundry’s rain-slick floor (blood vessel patterns) and Vera’s gold-sealed face constrain choices, charging the final footprints-as-constellation image. Every detail filters through alchemist’s urgency: "vials that glowed faintly amber," moonlight as "liquid mercury."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake (weight of names) tightens via Mira’s coin revelation and Vera’s kintsugi demonstration. Agency narrows options: the coin’s splitting forces Mira to confront identity’s fragility. Cost is visceral—Vera’s scars, the foundry’s ruin—shaping tactics toward acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coin’s transformation, not moralizing. Final line ("luminous regret that makes us human") reweights "wonder" as invitation, avoiding binaries. No thematic echo—insights arise from concrete alchemy, not abstract sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vera’s alchemist lexicon ("distilled intention," "transmute souls") shapes perception. Sentence rhythm shifts from sparse tension ("A shuffle in the darkness") to lyrical resolution ("footprints that caught the light"). No POV drift; "bitter as wormwood" feels character-particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. "Water still dripped... like liquid mercury" advances atmosphere and theme. Every phrase charges momentum: "cracks in broken pottery waiting to be filled with gold" pays off in coin’s transformation. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zodiac coin as identity-measuring device transforms tropes. Alchemy/kintsugi fusion feels inevitable, not checklist-driven. Emotional specificity ("she was apprenticed to Master Chen before he tried to transmute souls") avoids generic templates, resisting swappability.</comment>
