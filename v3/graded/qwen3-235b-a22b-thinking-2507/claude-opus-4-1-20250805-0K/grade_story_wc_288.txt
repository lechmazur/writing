<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices ("crushing isolation into independence" made concrete via museum curator role), but micro-choices under pressure lack escalation—Marcus' tea merely confirms insight rather than testing her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the sundial casting Kira's shadow crystallizes coexistence with extinction's absence, with conceptual cost in "measuring time between what was lost and what could still be found." Accumulative lens holds through resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brass sundial (tool-as-setting) constrains choice and charges closure—its shift from reflecting "time itself" to casting Kira's shadow reweights extinction's meaning. Tidal library's atmospheric shifts mirror her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by sundial's warming and stone circle hum narrows options toward coexistence, but the "brittle awakening settling" lacks tangible cost—conceptual stakes overshadow visceral tradeoffs despite the resonant shadow image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final shadow image reweights extinction as coexistence without moralizing; "carrying forward extinct wisdom" emerges from mammoth-herder memory rather than thesis. Avoids thematic echo by making "independence" a verb forged in atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "clouds rolled beneath glass floor like forgotten seas" and atomic reflection refracting selves. Stress compression ("brittle awakening settling") heightens texture without disrupting voice, taught early through fragmented memories.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No prose artifacts in peak beats; "brittle of transformation" metaphor avoids cliché by linking to ice/diamond physics. Slight synonym churn in "cracking open like an egg, spilling centuries" edges toward scaffold but pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "last of extinct species" trope through tidal library's micro-setting and "coexistence" as active translation—not preservation. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, proven by shadow's irreplaceable role.</comment>
