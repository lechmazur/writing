<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses (rigid chemist vs. yearning mother) act simultaneously in foam observation and texting micro-choices; embodied grief ("loosened grief transforming") avoids labels. Flaws drive inevitable mistakes without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elena’s texts crystallize options with felt cost ("grief transforming into something else entirely"). Accumulative lens holds—density increase in foam patterns reweights stakes without causality breaks. Orientation clear by line 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Braided ravine constrains choice (release chrysalis) and charges final image ("three voices becoming one"). Micro-setting (foam patterns) directly triggers insight, avoiding postcard description through causal pressure on Marina’s decision-making.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marina’s agency: foam observation deepens knowledge ("divergent path" insight), narrowing options from clinical apologies to "symphonically" text. Cost legible in "loosened grief transforming" under accumulative lens without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through foam’s "rhyming" patterns and chrysalis release—no moralizing. Final image reweights "divergent path" as symphonic convergence, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity (science/music as complementary, not equalized).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Marina notices "helical patterns" and "structural color" through chemist’s lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Delete. Too clinical.") taught early; no head-hopping. Lyric compression pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; sentences like "loosened grief transforming into something else entirely" do triple duty. Final line recharges motif with precision ("three voices becoming one"). No figurative muddle in peak beats—foam imagery remains coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer chemistry/music through lived detail ("Debussy built chords... through structure"). Avoids STEM stereotypes; emotional specificity ("I was wrong to see only one path forward") feels inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
