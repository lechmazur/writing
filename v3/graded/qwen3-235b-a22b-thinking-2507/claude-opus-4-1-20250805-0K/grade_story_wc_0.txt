<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes through micro-choices (skipping department meetings, building observation stations) rather than alternating summaries; resignation earned by accumulated dust-pattern observations with visible career cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via final notebook entry reweighting decay as instruction; cost legible in "career suicide" accusation; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through dust-pattern density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse mud and butterfly dust constrain choices (salvaged materials for stations) and charge final image; rot smell and fractal mold directly shape her observational shift without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mathematical vs patient observation) tightens through agency-driven dust-pattern documentation; resignation forecloses neutron star career with felt cost ("career suicide") under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (butterfly dust as data, colleagues' "theatrical mourning"), not abstraction; final line reweights decay without moralizing while honoring complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("microscopic dust," "fractal patterns") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in final paragraph avoids syntactic monotony despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mud-caked benches and persistent smell of rot" compresses setting/character in one stroke; final line’s resonance achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist finds wisdom in nature" trope through neutron star researcher’s specific epistemological shift; risk-taking in quiet closure deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
