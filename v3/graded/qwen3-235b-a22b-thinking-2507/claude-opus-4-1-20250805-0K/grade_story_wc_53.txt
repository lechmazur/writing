<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's internal conflict between eroded ambitions and emergent purpose is embodied through micro-choices with the camera wheel; her final stance crystallization as memory keeper earns visible cost via "ambitions eroded not through failure but through success" without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly when ghost dissolves and waters restart; Accumulative lens holds through voice-fragment accumulation; cost legible in "world built itself without us" crystallizing irreversible surrender of rebuilding dreams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic Lagoon actively constrains choices as micro-setting—its voice-absorbing waters supply the story's very mechanism; the disposable camera wheel evolves from tool to temporal bridge, charging the final image where waters "learn how" to move again.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuilding vs. preserving) tightens through Kira's agency when she reframes fragments as "instructions. Warnings. Maps"; cost crystallizes as conceptual forfeiture—"we wanted to build a new world... but the world built itself without us"—narrowing her path irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: the carousel's halt and ghost negotiation reweight "eroded ambitions" into earned transformation; final image ("waters began to move again, slowly, as if learning how") resonates without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time moved differently here," "weathered fingers") filters all observation; rhythmic control under pressure modulates from stillness to "timeline snap" without head-hopping; elision of time layers taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rust eating through iron" metaphor integrates causally with theme; final line's propulsion ("as if learning how") recharges the carousel motif with earned hope, avoiding purple prose while maximizing density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of floating carnival + voice archaeology avoids derivative tropes; "lagoon's memory keeper" reconfiguration feels inevitable through prior particulars; risk-taking with nonlinear time heightens stakes without obscuring the closure's emotional charge.</comment>
