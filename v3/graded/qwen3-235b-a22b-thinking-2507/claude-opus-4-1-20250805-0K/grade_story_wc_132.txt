<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (control vs surrender) act in scene; final merging earned by grandmother's wisdom with visible bodily cost ("greenish tint" fingernails). No diagnostic label-speak; embodiment anchors epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: dissolution of boundaries crystallizes options with undeniable cost ("no longer fully human"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density (ferns reversing, glowing moss)—with cost legible in merging leaf and bone-deep transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (linden leaf) constrains choice at climax; mossy trellis charges final image as Marcus touches it with transformed skin. Rainstorm actively tightens decisions ("three weeks early"), avoiding postcard description through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs becoming) tightens when leaf merges with palm; cost visible in physical transformation. Escalation driven by Marcus's agency ("loosened his hold"), reweighting options under accumulative lens with irreversible bodily price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (leaf merging, moss recognition), not abstraction. Final image reweights "study vs become" without moralizing—grandmother’s grafting wisdom crystallizes into Marcus’s embodied understanding, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (botanical precision: "veins rearranging," "DNA helix thorns") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from measured observation to fluid acceptance; no head-hopping, with reflection anchored to linden leaf’s glisten.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "watercolor on wet paper" metaphor clarifies dissolution without muddle. High density ("fronds becoming something prehistoric") propels closure. Final line recharges "threshold" motif with crystalline specificity, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms metamorphosis trope through botanical specificity (linden’s cellular shifts, DNA thorns). Emotional truth in reluctant surrender ("wanted to grip it tighter") avoids generic templates; storm-season urgency feels indispensable, not derivative.</comment>
