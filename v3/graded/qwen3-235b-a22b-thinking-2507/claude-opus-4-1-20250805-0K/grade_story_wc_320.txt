<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (Guild pragmatist vs silence-seeker) manifests in discarding quantum processors for the fragment; embodied epiphany via "spaces around silence" avoids label-speak. Micro-choice to connect fragment personally rather than use Guild tech reveals hierarchy of values with felt cost in the final renunciation of monetization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: dawn-lit towers + "promise" fragment crystallize stance crystallization with conceptual cost (rejecting Guild's commercialization). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through density increase in resonance patterns. Cost proof: "tune her life differently" shows visible trade-off with institutional power.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Whisper Gorge’s mineral rain and lunar pull actively constrain choice—swaying towers create signal gaps essential for the shard. The Hollywood fragment evolves from pocket object to tool to charged symbol, charging the final image through tactile specificity ("now-cool fragment... weight like a promise").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via lunar perigee’s gravitational distortion narrowing options to one window. Agency-driven escalation peaks when fragment resonance reveals silence’s potential, forcing Maya’s renunciation of Guild pragmatism. Conceptual cost lands in the final line’s "listen closely enough," avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "pause between heartbeats" reweights silence as generative space. Final image ("every ending was just a beginning...") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, resisting binaries through Maya’s rejection of both Guild exploitation and pure silence-as-absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: signal interpreter’s lexicon ("spectral receivers," "frequencies") shapes all observation. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented cadence ("Static filled her awareness—the cosmic background radiation...") taught early and paid off in shard sequence. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "amber shadows across weathered equipment" exemplifies textural specificity. "Serenely electric" avoids register drift through POV-consistent technicality. Final line’s "born" recharges "beginnings" motif with propulsion—no figurative muddle despite lyrical density in shard sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic silence trope through signal interpreter’s professional lens and tangible fragment. Emotional specificity in "spaces around silence" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently; the gorge’s mineral rain isn’t generic but pressures tactics via lunar sway.</comment>
