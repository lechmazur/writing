<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses before transformation; Mira's seamless acceptance of change weakens internal conflict despite strong embodied emotion ("fingertips tingle with forgotten memories"). Micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values only after moonstone prodding, missing pre-crisis struggle crucial for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost (silver-threaded hair, transformed eyes dissolving moonstone speck). Orientation perfect by line 3; accumulative lens held through leaf-pattern escalation. Cost proof solid: "becoming part of her story" crystallizes irreversible change with folklore weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ashen Arbor constrains every choice: upward-falling leaves dictate decoding method, petrified branches frame twilight hush. Micro-setting triumph—moonstone speck’s dissolution charges final image while moss growth alters arbor palette. Environment actively shapes tactics, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trees' ascension choice) signaled early but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Mira’s agency emerges only after moonstone rings; the "choice approaching" feels revealed rather than earned through her struggle. Cost visible but not deepened by prior resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seed-monuments translating leaf-warnings into "conversation between earth and sky." Final image ("moss grew wherever she touched") resonates without moralizing, reweighting folklore as living dialogue. Avoids thematic echo via concrete particulars like "Dreaming Willow" shrines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "seeds hummed frequencies," "veins that formed letters" filter world through seed-sorter’s expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure—"leaves swirled faster now"—avoids syntactic monotony. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from precision to "mossy delight" euphoria.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "petrified branches stretched between clouds like bridges of bone" establishes texture without scaffold. One paraphrase loop ("forgotten things"/"lost varieties") barely dents density. Final line’s "symphony only she could comprehend" avoids cliché through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "earth vs sky" trope via regional folklore mechanics (seeds as linguistic syllables). Fresh inflection in gravity’s "rebellious children" reframing. Emotional specificity in "mossy delight" avoids generic wonder; arbor’s ash-gray palette made "alive" through earned transformation.</comment>
