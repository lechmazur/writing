<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marcus's shift from calculation to song, with embodied flaws (voice cracking) revealing vulnerability under pressure. Micro-choices like touching the puppet's cheek concretely manifest his value hierarchy, though Eliza's absence limits relationship crucible depth despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the beam igniting while tears "belonged to no one and everyone" crystallizes the cost of tender confrontation with ending. Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation—each step up the stairs narrowing options toward singing—without causal breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens apparatus constrains Marcus's final action (placing the puppet head), charging the closure image where light "refracted and multiplied" through cracks. Sensory details like "bruised plum" dusk evolve causally with plot, avoiding symbolism by mirroring internal shifts through tool-based interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation tightens through Marcus's agency: the puppet's discovery transforms abstract clockwork into embodied stakes, culminating in singing as the only path forward. The cost—tears and backward-moving hands—reconfigures inevitability into "terrible love," though the singular stake lacks secondary friction to push toward 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the lullaby's "cracking" voice reweights "ending" as connection, not erasure. Final image ("you were never alone, even in ending") resonates without moralizing, earning wisdom through Marcus's flawed performance rather than abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in time-as-light metaphors ("fracture and refract across centuries like light through a prism"), modulating rhythm under pressure with purposeful fragments. Slight register drift occurs when "quantum threads" momentarily clash with lyrical voice, but cohesion holds through emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion shines in sparse, charged phrases ("light gathered in its cracks"), though "bruised plum and copper" risks decorative overwriting in a high-pressure beat. Zero loops or scaffold, but one borderline stock metaphor ("spider-webbed with cracks") prevents 9.0 despite crystalline closure imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday tropes through the lullaby mechanism—fresh synthesis where melody adjusts time—avoiding abstraction via specific "taffy-stretched peace" details. Emotional truth in Marcus's untrained voice elevates risk-taking, making the premise feel inevitable yet revelatory in hindsight.</comment>
