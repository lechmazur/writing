<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira's interior contradiction ("wildness" vs "sculpting impatience") manifests concretely in rod-placing precision under pressure; Tomás' minimal presence effectively applies secondary pressure. No therapy-speak despite high stakes, though micro-choices beyond rod placement lack specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "freedom always felt like falling" crystallizes conceptual cost while "someone was thinking their first free thought" reconfigures options. Accumulative lens holds through lunar-path accumulation; 73-hour deadline creates tangible pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Basalt columns and frozen lake constrain choices (rod placement on ice cracks) and charge the final image ("frozen lake reflected the brightening sky"). Moon's reflection guides action while glacial transformation mirrors the revolution's quiet progression—environment actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the 73-hour deadline and dawn approach, narrowing options to precise rod placement. Cost ("freedom feels like falling") is legible in Kira's anticipation of panic, though secondary pressure from Tomás could deepen the trade-off beyond logistical support.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "water working through stone" reweights revolution as accumulation, not upheaval. Final image ("magnetic viaduct hummed its new tune") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "patience of geological time" proximity to thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("magnetic pull humming beneath volcanic rock," "wildness building in chest") reflects Kira's mapping profession. Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate ("steps soft but deliberate") to lyrical ("like ice claiming a lake") under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; "sculpting her impatience into something harder than basalt" integrates metaphor with action. Minor paraphrase loop in "revolution required the patience of geological time" followed by "patient accumulation of small changes" costs 0.3 but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms revolution tropes through geological patience and lunar mechanics—specific details (73-hour polarity shift, meteorite iron instruments) create freshness. "Water freezing" metaphor synthesizes premise into inevitable emotional truth without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
