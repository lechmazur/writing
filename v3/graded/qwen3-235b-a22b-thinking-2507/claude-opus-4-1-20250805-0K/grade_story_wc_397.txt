<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marlene’s euthanasia-tourist motivation manifests through embodied contradictions (e.g., parasol as both weapon and compass), with the palm-cutting micro-choice crystallizing her transformed stance without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of singing with the ice reconfigures "endings" with conceptual cost (abandoned boats, shrinking world), while the Accumulative lens holds through calibrated ice-break escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The marina’s micro-setting constrains every choice—from evacuation timing to Marlene’s ice-watch vigil—and charges the closure as both physical space and metaphorical "frozen cemetery" made visceral through cracking sounds and thinning ice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Marlene’s agency (volunteering for ice-watch), narrowing options as calving intensifies; the felt cost—her palm’s pain and the family’s shrinking world—reweights survival in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "windborne solace" reframes mortality via ice physics and parasol lace, avoiding moralizing while the final line ("endings that refuse to end") offers non-literal resolution to the euthanasia premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ice sing its breaking songs") modulates under stress with rhythmic shortening ("The marina sang louder after midnight"), while elisions (Swiss procedure details) are taught early and paid off in the closure’s transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension ("boats sat trapped like insects in amber" merges setting and theme), with no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the calving sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of euthanasia tourism with Arctic disaster relief avoids tropes through specific physics (ice calving as "sigh") and the parasol’s evolving role, risking quiet closure that pays off with "strange harmony" earned by prior particulars.</comment>
