<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest in frantic triage (saving only 50 slides) versus desire to preserve all, culminating in earned endurance via "I promise to begin again" with visible cost in collapsing library. No diagnostic label-speak; embodied tension in "fingers, numb despite gloves" fumbling the founder's slide.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: library's physical collapse ("ice became rain") crystallizes the transition from preservation to renewal, reconfiguring stakes through Elara's vow. Accumulative lens holds as measurement density builds to the founder's vow reweighting all prior meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Frozen Library actively constrains choices: failing cold forces urgency, flickering slides dictate triage, and the vault's physical decay directly pressures Elara's actions. Micro-setting (satchel, calipers) charges closure as saved slides "seed a new archive," fulfilling 9+ gate via environment shaping tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving meaningful vows) tightens through accumulating measurements (6.3→9.7→beyond scale), narrowing Elara's options until the founder's vow forces conceptual trade-off. Cost is unmistakable: physical collapse and loss of thousands of vows paid for renewal, driven entirely by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "luminous vows" measured by frequency evolve into cyclical renewal via "I vow to remember them all" → "I promise to begin again." Final image reweights meaning without moralizing, offering non-literal answer through slides seeding new archive while avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in archival lens ("footstep rang like a prayer bell against ice"), with rhythmic control tightening under stress ("Ice cracking beneath her feet"). Zero head-hopping; projection's "voice like winter wind" filtered through Elara's POV maintains focalization while modulating intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("warmth seeping from walls like blood from stone" compresses worldbuilding and stakes). Final line recharges "quartz hush" with new meaning while maintaining propulsion. Peak-beat clarity in "Light exploded outward" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "dying library" trope via specific mechanics: vow-frequency triage, magic lantern slides as physical stakes, and founder's meta-promise redefining preservation. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing climax feels inevitable through prior accumulation, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
