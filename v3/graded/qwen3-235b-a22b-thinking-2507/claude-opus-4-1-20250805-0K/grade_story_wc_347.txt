<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (freedom vs duty) manifest physically through walnut handling and “graceless beauty” movements; cost of her endurance—perpetual imprisonment—is embodied in frost-sealed labyrinth without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes cost: Mara watches travelers leave while frost seals her in, reconfiguring her hope ("Perhaps tomorrow...") against irreversible stakes; Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inverted orchard and walnut constrain choices—seed’s removal anchors curse mechanics; final image of "twisted trees" charges closure by embodying Mara’s trapped state beyond mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frost deadline tightens tactics organically; travelers’ arrival forces Mara’s seed sacrifice, narrowing options to endurance with visible cost—her continued imprisonment made legible through "frost forming now, delicate and deadly."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through inverted orchard’s physical reality: "reluctant caretaker" endurance answers "What sustains us?" without moralizing; final line ("that was enough") resonates as earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("offhandedly exact precision," "graceless beauty") persists under stress; rhythmic control in high-pressure beats (e.g., "luminous trails appeared, marking safe passages") avoids syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "worn smooth from years of nervous handling" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction: "almost sounded like approval" slightly anthropomorphizes birds without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of inverted ecology and caretaker duty avoids trope; "roots growing from fingertips" transforms curse into visceral metaphor. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
