<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("edges soft as grief") but lacks contradictory impulses in peak naming moment; micro-choices under pressure strong yet motivation remains static without escalation of internal conflict during transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with undeniable cost ("erased by the saving"), but reflection exceeds BRR limit (22% vs 20% cap), slightly muddying present-frame micro-choices despite coherent accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atlas page functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges final image; observatory's lens and wax cylinders actively shape tactics ("scattered light began to crystallize"), avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency in naming fears under accumulative lens; cost ("echo of sacrifice—to save what you love and be erased") unmistakable on final page, reweighting eternity as companion rather than terror.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sea monsters' transformation without moralizing; final image ("companions in her eternal voyage") offers resonant answer to "nameless fears" by recharging atlas page with earned wisdom, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusk paint the sky in bruises") with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, and lyrical compression taught early ("bruises," "grief") pays off in closure's crystallized monsters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "edges soft as grief" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-deduction for "nameless fears" bordering abstraction but saved by immediate dramatization through ink-to-substance transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transcends psychopomp trope via specific emotional logic: "echo of sacrifice" synthesizes grief/eternity into fresh, inevitable concept; risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
