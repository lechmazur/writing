<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak pressure; "variant allegiance" is stated but not dramatized through conflicting actions. Interiority remains steadfast without visible struggle beneath the devotion, weakening the Earned Stasis cost of her isolation ("never meeting the Prophet").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the Prophet's broadcast crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("shaping his rise through fragmented transmission"). Orientation is immediate (cobalt portico/storm), and the lens holds through density escalation to the final cerulean shadows.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico actively constrains choices (pressing ear, opening panel during storm) and charges the final image ("cerulean shadows reaching toward futures"). Storm pressure forces tangible adaptations, making the micro-setting indispensable to both tactics and closure resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating transmissions (pirate stations, child's numbers), but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Agency in broadcasting patterns is clear, yet Marlowe's physical/emotional toll during the storm lacks embodied contradiction—e.g., no tremor in her hands as she cranks the panel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through subtext ("harmonics not apocalypse"), avoiding moralizing. Slight overstatement in "lonely visionary had midwifed a new age" nudges toward explanation, but the Prophet's final broadcast reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tomorrow tastes like copper") shines under pressure. Minor register drift in "reality's origami creases" slightly disrupts the scientist's voice, but rhythmic control during the storm (short clauses amid static) sustains tension without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops, but high-pressure beats contain mild overwriting ("reality's origami creases smoothing and reforming"). Figurative language remains legible, yet "paradox would kill most people" edges toward purple prose without sufficient payoff in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio static as prophetic conduit elevates the "prophet" trope. Emotional specificity in Marlowe's technical mysticism ("Fibonacci sequences in morse code") avoids abstraction, though the archetype's familiarity caps the risk distinction just below 9.0.</comment>
