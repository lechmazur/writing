<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak in peak moment; "no fear" reaction to darkness lacks embodied struggle despite pacifist training. Micro-choices under pressure (e.g., photograph selection) show values hierarchy but emotional calibration feels too textbook-perfect during integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "weightless with joy tempered by understanding" crystallizes the integration's price. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through tear-drop dissolution and ship transformation, reweighting humanity's fracture with visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled ship functions as essential micro-setting—warships becoming gardens during climax charges the final image. Gravitational mechanics constrain choices (floating/sinking during meditation), though early "patchwork" description lacks specificity until the transformation beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via photograph dissolution sequence narrows options meaningfully under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in "joy tempered by understanding," but the shadow dimension's danger lacks concrete manifestation beyond "whispers/screams," slightly diluting visceral stakes despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("first human complete") reweights "last human born" into a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Theme emerges through stitching action and ship transformation—complexity embraced via "capacity for creation/destruction finally whole" without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature (tear topology, weight shifts) sustains rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "bodhisattva" exposition; grandmother-AI voice lacks differentiation but doesn't contaminate Mei's lyrical interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "oil on water" shimmer and "recycled parts remembering origins" achieve high density without muddle. Slight overwriting in "opalescent sheen" but final line ("ghostly resolve transformed") earns conceptual repricing with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Buddhist shadow work with sci-fi: gravitational emotion mechanic transforms tropes. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—ship's transformation feels inevitable from prior particulars, avoiding gimmickry while charging closure.</comment>
