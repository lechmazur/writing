<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("breaking was the only path to becoming") manifests in iterative micro-choices during crozier reconstruction; embodied sensitivity drives tactile decisions under heat without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: turning from Nexus crystallizes irreversible identity shift with conceptual cost ("something altogether more dangerous"), driven by accumulative pressure of 23 attempts under textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ember Nexus constrains every key choice—heat dictates ash dispersal patterns, molten core enables blood sacrifice—and charges final image with crystallized flame staff emerging from its heart.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus's agency: failed restoration attempts narrow options until blood sacrifice becomes inevitable, with visible cost in shredded hands and shattered monastic identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final "frozen bloom" image reweights creative destruction without moralizing; "burn everything down to grow something new" emerges from ash-weaving actions rather than thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in alchemical precision ("twelfth prayers unanswered") and heat-distorted focus; incantation syntax fractures under pressure while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "ashes began to dance. First, they formed..." shows minor paraphrase loop but propulsion remains relentless with crystalline specificity in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through lived-in details ("tears of mercury," "scarred hands") and morally complex Church critique; emotional specificity in stifled creation avoids generic underdog narrative.</comment>
