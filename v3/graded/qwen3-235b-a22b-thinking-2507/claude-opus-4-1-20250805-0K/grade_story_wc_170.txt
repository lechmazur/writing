<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "calm despite urgency" embodied in brushwork, but "borrowed heartbeat" risks abstraction; final choice earned through coded lullabies' progression. Sophia's absence limits relationship crucible despite emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "borrowed heartbeat growing stronger" crystallizes stakes with visceral cost under Accumulative lens. Orientation perfect within 50 words; lens consistency exceptional through dawn-to-bell rhythm. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism parapet constrains choices (light-bending informs painting method) and charges closure via rainbow-mist sparrow. Terrace echoes pressure tactics by amplifying sounds; "dusky harmony" hues actively mirror emotional state. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reaching Sophia) tightens through vanishing dawn hush and heartbeat urgency. Agency in painting/singing drives escalation; cost legible in "time contracted" and fragile hope. Accumulative pressure peaks with sparrow's song without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through prism light and coded lullabies: art as bridge to unconscious. Final heartbeat image reweights "borrowed" from burden to hope without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via concrete terrace-as-dream-portal mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "rainbow fragments trapped in crystalline balustrade." Rhythm modulates from lyrical dawn to staccato urgency; elision of coma cause taught early and pays off in sparrow's song. Zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "Violet shadows held golden promises" does triple duty. Minor scaffold in "She painted while singing..." sentence slightly dulls immediacy. No loops; final image ("blooms with doors") achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms maternal grief via art-metaphysics synthesis. "Borrowed heartbeat" trope made irreplaceable through prism-light logic. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; sparrow's lullaby payoff feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
