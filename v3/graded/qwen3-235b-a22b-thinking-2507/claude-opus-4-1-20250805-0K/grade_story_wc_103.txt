<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: trembling fingers yet deliberate steps onto bridges, "desperate need" versus final laughter. Final renunciation of retrocognitive imprisonment earned via dissolving photographs' cost—no therapy-speak, only moss-bark-mutable texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: fragment dissolution reconfigures time as "infinitely mutable" with visible cost ("each particle... took one of her other selves"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of fading images tightens stakes toward crystallized final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Living bridge garden constrains every choice: hyperbolic paths force temporal navigation, vines whisper chlorophyll secrets. Final image ("bridges laughed with her") charges closure—environment isn't backdrop but active participant in redefining time's texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: each fading photograph narrows options until dissolution forces renunciation. Cost legible in "one layer of the retrocognitive trap" vanishing—Accumulative escalation reweights "texture of time" from sought mystery to cultivated reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "time had texture because it was made of discrete moments" crystallizes via dissolving photographs. Final image ("she was its gardener") reweights prior material without moralizing—earned through vine-weaving metaphors, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "language of chlorophyll and cellulose," time "granular, crystalline." Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during fragment disintegration ("Not violently, but gently")—teaches lyrical compression paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "bleeding colors like watercolor paintings" serves dual purpose (image + temporal metaphor). Final beat "rough like bark, soft like moss" avoids overwriting—propulsion maintained through concrete verbs ("pulsed," "twist," "dissolving") without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through gardening lens: "time was a living thing, and she was its gardener" synthesizes maze design with temporal texture. Risk-taking (hyperbolic geometry as temporal conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry—fresh inflection feels inevitable.</comment>
