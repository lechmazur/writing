<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete micro-choices ("midnight lettuce," "conversations with moths") that embody Lila’s sacred witness. Only slight thematic echo in grandmother’s "absence is presence" line risks over-articulation but stays grounded in character context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "bread tasted of forgiveness and time" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors instantly; Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly through density shifts to the final crumb-by-crumb reckoning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Bread and gardens function as micro-setting, constraining Lila’s path ("led her deeper") and charging the final image. "Midnight lettuce" and "thornrose hedge" exemplify tactile specificity that shapes every choice without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lila’s deepening realization that attention "freed" the grandfather’s spirit, narrowing options to continued witness. Cost is visceral in "every crumb of love received"—a felt, conceptual price that reconfigures her ministry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through uncloaked bread and guerrilla gardens, never stated. Final line’s "forgiveness and time" offers non-literal answer to "sacred in ordinary things," avoiding moralizing while reweighting all prior particulars with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("moths writing messages," "shadows falling upward") defines Lila’s voice. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: fragmented revelation ("He was my grandfather") contrasts with lyrical closure, zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rosemary and time" compresses meaning elegantly. One borderline phrase ("benevolent secrets") skirts sentimentality but is redeemed by concrete action ("squash hiding beneath forgotten statuary"). Closure imagery remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism tropes via "heuristic kindness" and "midnight lettuce." Emotional specificity in "unauthorized seeds as acts of faith" avoids generic templates, making the sacred persistence feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
