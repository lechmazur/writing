<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows expertise but lacks contradictory impulses; Mira’s flawless insight undercuts struggle. "Softly ingenious" trait is told, not shown through tradeoffs. Micro-choices (tracing constellations) reveal values but emotional depth stays abstract without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: feather’s dissolution and "mysteries inhabited" reconfigure meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by word 15 ("burnt feather," "observation tank," "drowned city"). Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric escalation to the final vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and coral architectures constrain choices (Mira’s observation method) and charge the final image ("vibration of ancient songs"). Sensory details are selective, pressure-driven, and avoid tourist cataloging. Micro-setting (feather in tank) directly shapes the luminous respite’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the city’s rhythm) tightens through atmospheric deepening, not causal pressure. Cost is conceptual (feather’s purpose fulfilled) but stakes remain abstractly intellectual without visceral friction. Agency lies in observation, not decision, limiting escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "burnt feather" and coral-star dialogue: mysteries as lived experience, not puzzles. Final line ("inhabited") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by grounding insight in concrete dissolution of the feather.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "stone breathed," "fish moved in patterns that matched constellation charts" filters world through Mira’s astrologer lens. Rhythm modulates from clinical ("bioluminescent algae") to lyrical ("ascending souls") under pressure. Zero head-hopping; Chen’s dialogue serves subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crimped and blackened" and "breathing with light" offer textural specificity. Final line’s cadence ("sleeping until the stars would call again") recharges motifs without overwriting. Minor register drift in "ceremonial wings" but no closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Landscape astrologer" transforms underwater city tropes via coral-star symbiosis. Emotional truth in Mira’s quiet belonging avoids generic wonder. Risks lyrical structure but cohesion holds through feather’s reprise. Derivative elements (sunrise timing) are elevated by context.</comment>
