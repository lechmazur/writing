<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Arbiter’s cynical professionalism vs Marcus’s "protected vulnerability," but Marcus’s grief lacks embodied specificity beyond voice cracks; daughter remains off-page weakening relationship crucible despite potent micro-choice with burning questions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: hollow mirror reflecting "gray spaces" crystallizes moral complexity with visible cost in Marcus’s posture; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through wind chime revelations and rice-paper burning without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam physically enables closure by illuminating the mirror’s shift, while wind chimes function as micro-setting constraining revelation; "October wind" and "campfire ashes" anchor tactile urgency without postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (nuance vs certainty) tightens when Arbiter corrects "you killed her with simplicity," narrowing Marcus’s options; cost is visceral in his grip on the hollow shard, driven by verbal agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects: mirror’s emptiness→gray reflection reweights absolutes without moralizing; final image of "gray light dawn" offers non-literal answer to "shades of gray" question with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Arbiter’s lexicon ("conscience for hire," "dose of uncertainty") creates distinct perceptual signature; wind chime "stories the wind remembered" modulates rhythm under pressure without POV leakage or dialogue contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "designer uncertainty" compresses complex idea economically; only flaw is "hollow mirror shard" repetition in climax, slightly dulling closure image despite intentional motif function.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "grieving father" trope via Arbiter framework; "moral fog" premise gains freshness through lighthouse beam literally revealing gray spaces, avoiding abstract moralizing while risking quiet closure.</comment>
