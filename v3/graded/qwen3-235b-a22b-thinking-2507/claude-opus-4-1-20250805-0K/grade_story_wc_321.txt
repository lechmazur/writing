<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "three years or thirty" ambiguity and merging selves, but "resiliently positive" label intrudes twice without embodied cost, triggering diagnostic-speak penalty at peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with compass reweighting time's meaning, but "clocks run sideways" vagueness slightly muddies Accumulative lens escalation before grotto convergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spectral grotto constrains boarding choices and charges final image as solidified bridge, while hourglass (micro-setting) directly enables the merger—environment and tool jointly satisfy 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when hourglass warms and selves converge, but "losing coherence" static radio exchange lacks tangible cost escalation until final act, missing one visible price mid-beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mother-artist-scientist" fusion and compass final image—no moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration of "permanent transience" into living all paths simultaneously.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "constellations that spelled different stories" and "edges flickering," though tense shifts ("had been," "smiled") briefly disrupt psychic distance during convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "infinite moments suspended between never and always" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat, diluting immediacy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing-ferry trope through Marcus’s hourglass-as-tool (not symbol) and "compass to now" resolution—fresh synthesis where emotional specificity avoids genre clichés.</comment>
