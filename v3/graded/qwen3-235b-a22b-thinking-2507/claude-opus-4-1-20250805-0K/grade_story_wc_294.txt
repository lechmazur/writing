<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s inherited calm and contradictory impulses (connection vs. territory protection) drive choices, but final paragraph’s "patient wisdom" slightly over-articulates internal state, risking thematic echo despite strong embodied choices like rearranging bills.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: TerraLoop’s dissolution crystallizes the cost of circular thinking, with "greatest robbery" final line reweighting the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Abandoned train actively constrains choices (acoustics for whispers, skylight vantage), and the money collection charges the final image; "shadows and light played their eternal game" transforms setting into thematic engine without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Marcus’s phased interventions (bills → maps → recordings) deepens the circular-path stake under Accumulative lens; TerraLoop’s dissolution shows visible cost, with Chen’s recognition crystallizing the irreversible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars—no moralizing; the final bill-adding ritual offers resonant non-literal answer to "paths that trap us," avoiding Thematic Echo despite poetic language by grounding insight in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("perpetual twilight," "dusky harmony") and rhythmic control modulate with pressure; syntax shifts from lyrical to crisp during Marcus’s revelation, with no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances multiple elements (e.g., "rusting into the hillside like a wound healing over" establishes setting/theme/tone); final paragraph’s density intensifies without muddle, propelling toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms startup/crime tropes through the specific lens of circular paths; emotional truth in Marcus’s quiet guardianship avoids safety middle, with "phantom thieves from statistical noise" providing fresh, non-obvious insight.</comment>
