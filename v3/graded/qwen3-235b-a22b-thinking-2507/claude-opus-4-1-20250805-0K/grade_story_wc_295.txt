<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's embodied exhaustion ("tired eyes," physical interaction with objects) and micro-choice placing the memory card reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Slight over-articulation in epiphany ("Brief, beautiful...") risks label-speak but is redeemed by the daylily's concrete payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the memory card in the atlas crystallizes the generational relay with conceptual cost (fleeting comprehension vs. eternal stars). Orientation flawless within 100 words; Accumulative lens holds through sensory pattern accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The daylily constrains choice and charges closure—its one-day bloom symbolism reweights the final image. Observatory micro-setting (brass housing, audio-converted whale song) pressures perception but lacks tactical constraint beyond observation tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding cosmic warnings) deepen through pattern recognition, but escalation lacks resistance—Hayashi's skepticism crumbles too easily. Cost is felt (cosmic loneliness to shared burden) yet visceral weight diminishes the quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects (telegram → memory card), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("burden... shared across centuries") reweights the daylily's transience without stating a moral, earning resonance through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "starlight whisper," "translucent as stained glass" filter astronomy through tactile poetry. Voice modulates perfectly—Hayashi's dialogue carries distinct scientific weight while Mira's narration gains rhythmic precision under revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "whale song, mournful and profound" achieves high density. Minor cliché ("dawned slowly") prevents 9.0, but final line’s cadence ("midnight solace of infinite space") delivers propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cosmic message" trope via generational relay and dream-chronicler lens. Daylily’s temporal symbolism (one-day bloom = human comprehension) is a fresh inflection that grows inevitably from prior details, avoiding derivative echoes.</comment>
