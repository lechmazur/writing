<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt manifests through embodied choices (sorting carvings, pocketing watch hand), not therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses—truth-seeking vs. complicity—drive his closure choice. Minor deduction: internal conflict could deepen the "corrupt bargain" tension earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "setting them down completely" crystallizes stakes with visible cost (destroying business). Accumulative lens holds—carvings’ pattern break reweights truth’s burden. Orientation clear by paragraph one; cost legible in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Driftwood carvings function as micro-setting, constraining Elias’s choices and charging the final image (watch hand added to "museum of tempered regret"). "Salt-worn wood" specificity mirrors his erosion; cobalt terrace’s bruised purples reflect internal state without cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. comfort) tightens via Elias’s agency: decoding carvings forces the "corrupt bargain" realization. Pressure escalates through accumulative density (coordinates → refugee ships), culminating in felt cost—business closure—foreclosing his livelihood path decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through carvings’ physicality, not moralizing. Final image reweights "manufactured memories" as unsustainable—"weights... lifted by setting them down" avoids tidy resolution while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "bruised purples," "sieved hush" filter world through Elias’s guilt. Rhythm modulates with tension (short clauses as horror dawns). No head-hopping; reflection stays anchored to driftwood’s tactile cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean but "weight of withheld truths" slightly abstracts in mid-beat. Minor scaffold in reflection ("he’d inherited...") stays within BRR limits. Closure beat ("setting them down") avoids loops; cadence shift intensifies finality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: genealogist’s trade in false memories collides with grandfather’s carved confessions. Avoids tropes via specific mechanics (driftwood coordinates, watch hand). Risk-taking (accumulative pressure over confrontation) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
