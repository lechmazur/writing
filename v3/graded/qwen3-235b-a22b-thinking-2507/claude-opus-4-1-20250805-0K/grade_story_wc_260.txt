<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina's contradictory impulses—using the chameleon's pain to save the sanctuary while believing she was rescuing it—manifest physically in the surgery scene ("each extraction peeling away another layer of deception"). Her final confession choice is earned through embodied degradation under stress ("trembling fingers," mist absorbing confessions), avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the reattached tail's "careful" grip mirrors her shattered self, while "three hundred animals would need new homes" crystallizes the fallout. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation (moonlight, stitches, dawn) tightening her stance without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The terrarium glass barrier evolves from deception tool to truth-seer ("a barrier she'd built but could finally see through"), constraining her choice during surgery and charging the final image. Mist literally absorbs her confession, while moonlight makes the tail's "blaze" pivotal to the reattachment act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: each removed bio-chip deepens the cost ("facades falling away") as missed calls loom. The dominant stake (sanctuary survival vs. integrity) tightens when she chooses truth ("the creature deserved that much"), with visible forfeiture—her career, the sanctuary—driving the confession.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the tail's journey: from "impossible colors" to "holding firm" with "genuine emotion." The final line ("just a lizard now, just alive") reweights the premise without moralizing, answering "what is real?" through the chameleon's quiet resilience after the shimmering deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vet-specific diction ("micro-sutures," "subcutaneous light emitters") grounds POV, while stress narrows perception to "each precise stitch." Only minor register drift in "facade" is redeemed by immediate physicality ("peeling away deception"), maintaining rhythmic control through high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "scales still shifting through impossible colors" establishes uncanny tone economically. Near-flawless density: "stars wheeled overhead through the workshop's sky panels" merges setting, time, and emotional shift. Slight tell in "exhausted from maintaining artificial brilliance" avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms conservation tropes through vet-specific moral calculus: the bio-chip twist makes her motivation (saving sanctuary) relatable, not monstrous. Specificity anchors universals—"fooled hundreds of visitors," tail reattachment surgery—avoiding safety-middle choices while risking emotional rawness.</comment>
