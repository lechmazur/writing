<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (craving connection vs fearing truth) embodied in crank-throwing choice; "eloquently silent" flaw constrains action with visible cost. Slight epiphany thinness in short form prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: "not-knowing felt like freedom" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (shattered glass, lost connection). Lens (Accumulative) holds through standing wave intensification; cost proof in "unable to know if her choice was right".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sepia room's golden shadows evolve into deepening dusk, charging the final image. Crank handle (micro-setting) constrains choice and shatters with the glass. Room specificity slightly generic but redeemed by closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Victoria's agency: perception waves narrow options to mastery or destruction. Escalation via intensifying standing waves under Accumulative lens; cost (shattered connection) is visceral and closure-linked. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: "some gifts too heavy" reweighted by mockingbird's unknowable song. Zero moralizing; final image answers central question through particulars. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber-tinted air", "yawn of evening") with rhythmic control under pressure. Slight early label ("eloquently silent") quickly embodied; no head-hopping. Compression taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat; high density ("standing waves rippled through amber-tinted air"). Minor paraphrase loop ("first yawn of evening" repetition) costs -0.2. Strategic telling avoids pivotal-beat summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms trope via vinyl consciousness capture; "not-knowing as freedom" angle feels fresh. Specific details (brass crank, sepia room) anchor universals. Bold risk in quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
