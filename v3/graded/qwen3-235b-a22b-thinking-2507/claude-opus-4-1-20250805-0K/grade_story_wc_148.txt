<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal journal discovery; Marcus's transition from despair to testimony feels unearned despite strong embodied details like "paint scuffed by desperate fingernails." Micro-choices under pressure remain underdeveloped at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the lattice's transformation crystallizes truth with conceptual cost ("every scuff... spell out the real story"). Journal discovery slightly convenient but hush motif teaches the Accumulative lens early; cost proof solid in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lattice functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its maze-like shadows evolve from cruel joke to truth-map, constraining Marcus's choice to "hover-carve" testimony. Copper light's sensory specificity ("amber repose") mirrors internal resolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus's realization that the lattice "sustains impossibilities," shifting from passive hush-chasing to active testimony. Supply boat deadline provides live clock, but the journal discovery lacks sufficient friction—knowledge shift feels abrupt without prior investigative attempts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "truth lives in spaces between heartbeats" reweights into Marcus's heartbeat as hush. Avoids moralizing; final image ("lighthouse prison... hold the truth") delivers conceptual repricing without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("copper light paint the confession booth's lattice"), but journal discovery summary ("discovered something... hidden beneath loose stones") momentarily breaks POV modesty. Rhythmic control peaks during testimony's cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Hover-carved" slightly muddles physical logic in high-pressure beat; "copper light grew deeper, richer" borders on overwriting. Otherwise impeccable propulsion—sentences like "The lattice seemed to pulse" compress history into visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "cry wolf" trope through lighthouse prison's physical impossibility (hovering) and ritualistic truth-carving. Emotional specificity in Marcus's reclaimed name ("True-Tongue") avoids generic redemption; copperlight repose subverts gothic expectations.</comment>
