<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied sensory translation ("truth pressed heavier"), not summary; final choice to "map the repairs" earns through cyclic shard history with felt cost in fraying reality imagery. No diagnostic labels under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options ("map the repairs") with undeniable conceptual cost in "fraying edges of reality." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation; orientation clear by line 15. Cost proof: "gift transformed from curse to cure" lands on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Repair bay micro-setting constrains all navigation choices and charges closure as "place of restoration." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (grease→violet whispers), with bioluminescent fungi and underwater shifts directly altering tactics. Environment essential to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when mother reveals map makers cause decay—a protagonist-driven deepening that forecloses exploration. Cost ("gift was also their curse") is visible in fraying reality and alters tactics immediately. Single meaningful escalation suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard's transformation ("curse to cure"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost: "infinite universes waiting to be saved" offers non-literal answer to "withheld truth" without stating a moral. Organic resonance from sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("engine grease→violet whispers"), rhythmic compression under stress ("Another redirect, more violent"). Elisions taught early via sensory translations; no head-hopping. Voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "synesthetic ribbons" serves pressure without muddle. Every sentence advances story ("shard pulsed faster" triggers nexus shift). Final line recharges shard motif with propulsion: "vast work ahead" implies ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "search for parent" trope via sensory mapping mechanics. Specificity ("realities where color sang") avoids genericness; risk-taking (sensory translations as navigation) heightens stakes coherently. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
