<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "volcanic tenderness" duality—destruction/creation embodied in scarred hands. Avoids diagnostic labels; "trembling fingers" and "tasted of smoke" ground epiphany in sensation. Near-miss: ancestral "promise" risks abstraction but saved by woven molecular structure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: final touch collapses centuries with visible cost (scarred hands, fugitive status). Accumulative lens holds—each fragment deepens pressure without coincidence. Cost proof: "time above thought her terrorist" crystallizes sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tapestry fragment constrains every choice—from decoding to memorization—and charges the final image. Sensory specificity ("copper and centuries," "limestone corridors") filters through Mira’s textile expertise. Micro-setting as environment: threads dictate tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: vandalized portraits become maps she alone can read. Dominant stake (rescuing imperishable memory) narrows options to memorization. Cost legible in "world above thought her terrorist"—identity sacrificed for truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through woven molecular structure, not moralizing. Final image reweights "volcanic tenderness" as destruction/creation unity—answering "how to preserve truth" without abstraction. Avoids thematic echo; "resurrection of denied future" resonates through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: textile scientist notices "anachronistic fibers," not architecture. Rhythm modulates with pressure—staccato during revelation ("Thread by thread"), flowing at closure. No head-hopping; stress compresses diction ("volcanic tenderness" intensifies meaning).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" repetition risks loop but evolves meaning (hands → final touch). Zero scaffold; every line advances stakes. Near-slip: "fused artistic sensitivity/scientific rigor" slightly abstract, but saved by "UV light map" specificity. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms arsonist trope through textile science—memory preserved in thread patterns, not stone. "Vandalized portraits as improvements" is fresh synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes; specificity ("Central Europe cave painting") avoids genericity.</comment>
