<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera's contradictory impulses (professional duty vs sacred preservation) manifest physically through film handling; "kissed the film strip once, tasting silver and salt" embodies micro-choice with visible cost. Avoids therapy-speak despite high emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Vera's walk out carries the cost of her professional lie ("Building cleared for demolition") while the film's preservation reconfigures stakes. Accumulative lens holds as emotional density peaks with Eleanor's letter before the crystallized exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (film storage in corners) and charges closure ("booth held its breath"). Art Deco curves catching shadows like "cupped hands holding secrets" makes environment inseparable from emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake (honoring unsent letters vs demolition duty) tightens through psychometric overload ("decades of goodbye letters layering like double exposures"). Vera's agency in preserving the film carries visible cost via her professional deception, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment>Vera's final act of threading letters onto her blank wall offers resonant non-literal answer to "unused love" theme without moralizing. Eleanor's ticket stub confession ("stored my love in the leader tape") deepens complexity beyond sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("cool brass of the projector, feeling decades of fingerprints") with rhythmic compression under pressure ("words without melody that had been spoken"). Slight register drift in "spatially imaginative part of her gift" prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder of her own heartbeat" demonstrates rhythmic propulsion without scaffold. Near-flawless density though "brittle celluloid holding frames of a movie nobody remembered" has minor redundancy in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted cinema" trope through psychometric specificity (emulsion absorbing breath fog). "Incubator" metaphor for unused love feels inevitable yet fresh, with demolition stakes heightening risk without gimmickry.</comment>
