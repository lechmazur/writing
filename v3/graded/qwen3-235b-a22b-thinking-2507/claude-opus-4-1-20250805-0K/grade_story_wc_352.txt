<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism-mind trait drives concrete choices under pressure; contradictory impulses (urgency vs. precision in grotto) and earned renunciation of normal life through "feeling them burn" show embodied cost. Slight emotional flattening in high-stakes moments prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds flawlessly from doodle discovery to Charged Poise closure. "Latent blaze burned carefully controlled" crystallizes conceptual cost of eternal vigilance with undeniable pressure. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto functions as active micro-setting: inverted gravity forces navigation choices, crystal nodes supply critical resources. Body (prism-mind) charges final image through "feeling combinations burn." Mist's tactile role slightly underspecified during crawlways.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation: Orin's vellum overlay and gravity-timed rush narrow options. Cost ("feeling them burn") legible when memorizing combinations. Dominant stake (containing knowledge) tightens through single decisive turn with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "seeds of vigilance" concept reweighted in closure as internalized burden. Final image reconfigures knowledge preservation without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing "too dangerous to be forgotten" through prior stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-mind revealed three realities") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression ("gravity shuddered") taught early. Minor register drift in "fossilized throat" description slightly disrupts archivist voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "water droplets fell upward like silver rain" achieves triple duty (image/pressure/tone). Final line recharges "latent blaze" motif with precision. No figurative muddle in peak beats; opening/closure anchor voice flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope via prism-mind mechanic and gravity inversion. Emotional truth in vigilance burden avoids safety middle. "Blood of sacrificed" detail provides verifiable freshness without quirks. Risk heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
