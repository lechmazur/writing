<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (Chen's wonder vs. fear, Mira's warmth vs. resolve) drive closure; final choice earned through cicada exchange with visible cost in his renewed commitment. No diagnostic labels—emotions embodied via tidal metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes: "every ending is the pause before beginning" reweights time's meaning with conceptual cost (Chen's fear transformed). Accumulative escalation via layered biological observations culminates in Mira's insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Grotto micro-setting pressures choices: wet rocks demand careful footsteps, tidal pools supply star-mirrors that charge Chen's realization. Jade cicada's recurrence constrains final image, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation deepens dominant stake (abandonment vs. witnessing) through Chen's "foresee" confession, raising emotional cost. Mira's agency drives the crystallization—"fear would mean believing endings"—with felt cost in his past retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from cicadas/sea stars without moralizing; final image (Chen holding cicada as pools prepare for tide) offers resonant answer to time's texture. Avoids Thematic Echo—insights earned through spider crab observation, not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: marine biologist's selective noticing ("microscopic symphonies," "texture of transitions"). Dialogue carries subtext (Chen's "weight of knowledge" vs. Mira's "witness"), rhythm modulates with wave's arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density: "truth rarely announced itself directly" advances character/theme/voice. Figurative language sparse but potent ("bioluminescent plankton sparkled like fallen stars"), diction consistently scientific-poetic. Final line recharges cicada with cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine biology and time philosophy: cicada symbolism transformed via tidal ecology. Specific details (sea star's dual action, hermit crab's shell choice) avoid generality; risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
