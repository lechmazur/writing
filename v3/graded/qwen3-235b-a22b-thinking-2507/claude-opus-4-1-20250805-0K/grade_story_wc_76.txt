<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "bleak exhilaration" and embodied choices like counter-clockwise wire winding. Flaw: grandmother's burden/solution framing edges toward convenient backstory without sufficient micro-choice anchoring in the present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the backward-sweeping beam reconfigures time's purpose with undeniable cost ("tide would return, but the light would continue"). Causal lens holds tight from yoyo discovery to stone inversion without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hunger stone isn't just setting—it actively constrains tactics (winding against its writhing darkness) and charges the final image where light "illuminates what had been lost." Micro-setting specificity elevates beyond atmospheric window dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elara's agency: each lens piece removed tightens options as latent radiance pulses stronger. Cost is visceral in the stone's "writhing" resistance and the irreversible tide retreat, making the final reversal feel earned under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the backward light's function—"repairing the past" resonates without moralizing. Final image avoids sentimentality by making conceptual cost undeniable: illuminating "what had been lost" reweights time's value without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: time mechanics color every observation ("water dripped backward up the walls"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short, urgent sentences during dismantling versus lyrical closure cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "darker than absence" exemplifies textural specificity. Only minor deduction: "bleak exhilaration" borders on label, but immediate embodiment ("laughed, a sound both bitter and triumphant") saves it from therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-reversal tropes through clockmaker specificity—the yoyo's "rhythm of motion" as cosmic key feels inevitable. Emotional truth in repairing loss avoids abstraction, with risk-taking (backward physics) heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
