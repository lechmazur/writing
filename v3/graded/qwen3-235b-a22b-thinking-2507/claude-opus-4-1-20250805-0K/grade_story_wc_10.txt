<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "tears frozen on cheeks" as embodied grief amid scientific focus; micro-choices like selecting 432 Hz fork reveal hierarchy of values (grief vs discovery) with visible cost. No therapy-speak; flaws (isolation) compound through sensory deprivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "tears frozen on cheeks" crystallizes emotional price of her realization. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—thermal patterns accumulate meaning until the final reframing of loss. No causality breaks; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Winterglass isn’t backdrop but constraint: transmits vibrations, refracts auroras into prismatic data. Frost patterns on leaves directly alter her observation method. Tuning fork case (micro-setting) charges the final image with Kepler’s initials—a recurring object that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes lack tangible escalation—her "must rectify" feels internal without external pressure or deadline. Accumulative deepening works (thermal patterns intensify), but the felt cost (frozen tears) is emotional rather than altering tactics. Dominant stake signaled early but not tightened sufficiently for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through thermal transcription: "music that could be seen and felt" avoids moralizing. Final line reweights loss as "secret language" without stating theme. No Thematic Echo—Indigenous consultants’ wisdom is shown through Mira’s embodied shift, not abstract sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "thermal phrases," "frost patterns pulse with unheard rhythms" filter all observation through her deafness. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences for wonder, staccato for action ("She began to transcribe"). Zero register drift or filter verbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning ("crystallized breath against Arctic shore" establishes setting/emotion). Final line recharges "winterglass" motif with "sing in temperatures." Figurative language ("golden warmth spread like ripples") remains precise in peak beats—zero muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms deafness tropes via thermal botany: "unshaken marvels" isn’t metaphor but lived science. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—aurora as "sound waves she could no longer access" gains devastating weight when reframed as visual music. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
