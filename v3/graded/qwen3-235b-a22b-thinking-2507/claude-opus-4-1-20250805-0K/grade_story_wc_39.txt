<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Marcus's collecting shifts from obsession to purpose via Elena's grief; embodied tears "carved clean tracks" avoid cliché. Minor flaw: vagrancy's roots stay unexplored, slightly thinning his transformation's inevitability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the ocean gave it back" crystallizes loss/recovery with felt cost (Elena's trembling hands). Accumulative lens holds; one tightening (finding her) suffices, though the single micro-turn risks thinness at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Music box constrains choices (drives Marcus's walk) and charges the final image (grandson's visit). Sensory hierarchy excels—"salt-stiffened blanket" filters setting through Marcus's tactile reality. Slight deduction: "feral loft" lacks closure integration beyond symbolic mention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving vanishing memories) tighten when Elena recognizes the melody, forcing Marcus's pivotal choice to sit with her. Agency-driven escalation with visible cost (her forgiveness altering his purpose). Minimal deduction: societal indifference could heighten urgency earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Elena's jarred story, not moralizing; final image ("laughter mingling with melody") reweights "lonesome splendor" as earned purpose. Avoids sentimentality via her anger ("I threw it in the ocean"). Near-miss: "translator between generations" skirts thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices sounds first ("dying languages of the shore"), voice modulates from lyrical ("positively wistful") to sparse ("the ocean gave it back"). Rhythmic control under pressure flawless; minor deduction for one elevated phrase in his POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tears carved clean tracks" exemplifies high-density prose. Final line recharges "lonesome splendor" with bittersweet precision. Deduction: "positively wistful" slightly drifts from Marcus's lexicon in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-collecting as poetry transforms "penny poet" trope. Specificity ("Portuguese Grandmother's Lullaby" jar) avoids genericity. Deduction: "vagrant" backstory lacks uniqueness, risking archetype proximity despite strong execution.</comment>
