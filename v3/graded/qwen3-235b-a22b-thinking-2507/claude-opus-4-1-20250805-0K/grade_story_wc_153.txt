<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "armor built around her gift" vs. vulnerability, but Marina's off-page absence weakens relationship crucible; embodied emotion strong yet "deeper wounds where unsent letters carved" flirts with label-speak risking −0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "fierce tenderness of admitting she'd been wrong" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory accumulation (condensation windows → new words) reconfigures options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mangrove roots ("frozen screams") and gargoyle shard constrain choices—shard's crumbling charges final image while water depth shapes movement; sensory selection (brackish air, knee-deep wading) filters through medium's urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency as condensation windows force confrontation with unsent letters, but external pressure from spirits lacks tangible opposition; "Marina waits" refrain tightens options yet feels slightly abstract without physical consequence beyond emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shard channeling "fear away from love" reweights "unsent letters" as active burden; avoids moralizing by ending on transformed hope ("weight lifting"), though "healing required exposure" edges close to thematic echo in final third.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "roots twisted like frozen screams" and spirit songs harmonizing with "truths never spoken"; rhythmic control under pressure peaks with "time folded backward" cadence shift, though Marina's dialogue risks over-articulation in flashback.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("condensation rose like morning mist" → "frosted with messages"), but "singing spirits wove melodies through brackish air" risks mixed metaphor (weaving melodies); no closure-dulling artifacts despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "unsent letters" trope through gargoyle shard's physicality and mangrove setting; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry, with "fierce tenderness" redefining maternal apology beyond generic templates.</comment>
