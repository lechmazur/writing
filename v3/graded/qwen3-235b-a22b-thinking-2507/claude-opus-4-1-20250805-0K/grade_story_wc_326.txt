<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via heartbeat spikes during digital reintegration, but motivation lacks sufficient internal resistance to "fetch wisdom" beyond solitary focus; no secondary pressure to test values under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "178, 179" heartbeats crystallize dual existence while ink fades, proving Accumulative lens holds. Radio static clearing anchors time without disorientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Porcelain shard constrains choices (ink conduit) and charges final image reflecting dual selves; observatory’s snowfall actively pressures perception ("breath cloud in unheated space").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marcus’s ink experiments narrows options toward conceptual cost ("part of him had died"), but dominant stake (digital reintegration) lacks competing fear to deepen tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s "ephemeral geometries" resolving into "both dead and alive" without moralizing; final heartbeat count reweights life/death binary via conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "porcelain shard caught green glow" and heartbeat rhythms; compression of digital failure ("weeks of error") taught early and paid in ink patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "galaxy wheel matched spiral" shows high density. Near-miss: "digital shadows he'd become" slightly drifts register but redeemed by concrete ink actions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error + digital ghost avoids trope through specific ink method; "death certificate prophetic" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet startling.</comment>
