<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "tender and distant" packing and embodied grief/joy while painting; no label-speak. Fishermen underutilized as secondary pressure slightly weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably in final image ("perfectly whole" reconfiguring impermanence) with visible cost ("confused grief"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly from mirror crack to cave revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Phosphorescent algae isn't backdrop—it enables shell discovery, while seashells function as micro-setting constraining Marina's painting choice and charging the final image's "permanent in its impermanence" resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marina's agency: journal revelation forces redefinition of "permanent things," with immediate cost in her painting act. Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens knowledge without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through shells' evolving meaning—final "permanent in its impermanence" reweights prior material without moralizing. Journal quotes stay diegetic, avoiding authorial intrusion in the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Painter's perceptual signature ("pearl-white spiraling into shadow") persists under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from mechanical packing to flowing cave discovery. Zero head-hopping in tight 3rd-limited POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spider-webbing" metaphor pays off organically. Final line’s cadence ("perfectly whole") recharges "impermanence" with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "temporary eternity" through painter’s practice—derivative premise transformed by lived detail (43 years, tourist forgetfulness). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
