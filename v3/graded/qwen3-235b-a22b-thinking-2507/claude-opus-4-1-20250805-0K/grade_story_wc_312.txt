<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s lukewarm magic flaw actively enables success (stronger mages would’ve shattered realms), with exhaustion post-ritual embodying cost. Contradictory impulses—grief vs. scientific rigor—drive micro-choices like precise dew-rate calibration under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: fishing boat’s bell ringing reconfigures cosmic stakes with visible cost (Mira’s collapse). Causal lens holds—third drop’s suspension triggers realm overlap, narrowing options to her delicate execution without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as active tuning fork, not backdrop: dawn humidity constraints force the three-drop timing, directly shaping tactics. Final image of its "soft humming" charges closure by reweighting the setting as a boundary guardian.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via the third drop’s suspension—a causal escalation where Mira’s precision forecloses catastrophic collision. Cost is visceral in her collapse, scaling perfectly to the length; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the broken bell’s "harmonics no intact instrument could produce," rejecting power for precision. Final reflection avoids moralizing by tying "naive" belief to actionable physics, reweighting cosmic rules through the lighthouse image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice distills Mira’s scientific obsession ("dripping rates of condensation") into character-particular phrasing. Minor overwriting risk ("prayer made of stone") is offset by precise later diction, with psychic distance tightening under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "translucent fish flickered" shows textural specificity. Slight tell in backstory compression ("burning through savings") costs 0.2, but final line’s "ringing bright and true" delivers resonant propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "mediocre mage" trope through acoustic physics—broken bell’s fracture creates essential harmonics. Risk-taking (science as magic) heightens stakes coherently, with the sapphire viaduct’s tuning-fork logic feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
