<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta's "gently persistent wisdom" manifests through concrete actions (rationing her stores, refusing credit) rather than summary, and her final delegation feels earned. Lacks contradictory impulses during peak pressure—no visible struggle when supplies dwindle—slipping just below 9.0 despite strong micro-choices like pausing on the bell rope when Samuel questions anonymity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the final bell shift from survival to celebration crystallizes the community's woven identity with Marta's exhaustion ("she was tired now, her work complete") as undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the pattern break when shadows gather autonomously at six months tightens options irreversibly, reconfiguring meaning without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (midnight anonymity hinges on its location) and charges the closure: Marta listening to "anonymous footsteps gathered below" in its shelter reweights the initial "forgotten prayer" image with earned resilience. Recurring bell tolls shift from desperation to celebration, avoiding symbolism through tactile use (fingers tracing silver, rope-pausing).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pattern breaks—officials' arrival tests the community's cohesion—but Marta's late-stage delegation slightly weakens protagonist agency. Pressure accumulates impeccably under Accumulative lens: the basket's appearance (week 4) and Samuel's silent accompaniment deepen the dominant stake (dignity through anonymity), with Marta's fatigue providing visible cost that alters her final choice to step back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the bell's reweighted meaning and officials' bafflement at the "unified silence" avoid moralizing while answering the intergenerational support question non-literally. Final image ("echo lived on in every heartbeat") crystallizes the cost of sanctioned years without abstraction, resisting tidy binaries by showing systemic neglect alongside human resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "benevolent shadows" and "amplified quiet," with rhythmic control intensifying under pressure (e.g., the staccato "No one pointed, no one spoke" during officials' visit). Avoids head-hopping; single-POV consistency is flawless except one slight tell: "human nature with a gently persistent wisdom" edges toward summary where showing might deepen.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: every sentence advances momentum (e.g., "Teenagers began tending gardens..." compresses months of change without scaffold). Zero loops or figurative muddle—even the poetic final line avoids purple prose through concrete "heartbeat" motif. One minor issue: "gently persistent" description slightly tells where showing (e.g., cracked hands from rationing) could heighten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "community resilience" trope through specific mechanics: anonymity as anti-shame system and bell as heartbeat. Fresh inflection lies in rejecting savior narratives ("not a savior, not a neighbor")—Marta's wisdom emerges from cultural specificity (terra-cotta arbor, antique bell). Avoids safety middle but falls shy of 9.5 by not fully exploring systemic complicity beyond officials' frustration.</comment>
