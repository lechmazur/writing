<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—duty versus curiosity—drive every micro-choice (e.g., pocketing goggles, decoding mid-ascent), with embodied emotion ("breath misted as altitude stole warmth") avoiding label-speak. Final endurance (climbing anew) earns cost through prior causality: her tactile decoding reconfigures sorrow into agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: "sorrow needn’t freeze us solid" reweights the premise with felt cost (shattered belief in Thorne’s frozen death). Accumulative lens holds—each floor’s revelation tightens pressure via density increase, culminating in the diary’s tangible warmth against her palm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining choices (tilting to project coordinates) and charging the final image (leather "warm against her palm"). Frost-etched windows evolve causally—reflecting clouded sky then revealing coordinates—proving environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (decoding Thorne’s truth) escalates through Mira’s agency: each floor’s discovery narrows options (e.g., ice cracking forces urgency). Cost is legible in "sorrow needn’t freeze us solid"—her prior worldview shattered, now embracing active hope with tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "small joys preserved like pressed flowers" rejects tidy morals. Final image ("tenderness survives") reweights sorrow through the goggles’ lens—a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mira notices "ice crystals danced... like suspended grief," filtering the world through scientific tenderness. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Fourth floor. Fifth floor.") modulates with emotional intensity, teaching its pattern early without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances meaning (e.g., "gears clicked like a grandfather clock counting backwards" compresses time and tension). Figurative language ("ice cracking like breaking bones") clarifies physical stakes without muddle, even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the "found diary" trope through specific mechanics (goggles revealing coordinates via light). Emotional truth ("joy beneath anguish") avoids generic templates, with the spire’s narrowing walls heightening stakes through bold structural risk that never obscures clarity.</comment>
