<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Embodied emotion ("serene anger," albino features catching light) and micro-choices (deliberate ink spill) show strong interiority, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during the climax; motivation remains abstract despite clear stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost (her life's work culminating in understanding), but the avalanche backstory fragment slightly oversteps BRR limits by summarizing without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian pool and disappearing ink actively constrain choices (her methodology hinges on ink patterns), while the wind-carved encampment evolves with the eclipse to charge the final image of her merging with temporal patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the eclipse countdown ("three minutes until totality ends") and ink's reverse cascade, with agency rooted in her observations; cost is legible in her transformation from anger to understanding as options narrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ink patterns reweighting time's nature—"consciousness never separate from time"—without moralizing; the final image of her disappearing into work resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind-carved encampment," "quantum foam") and rhythmic control under pressure, but the drone's technical description momentarily drifts from her plausible lexicon during high-stakes observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold with high information density; minor deduction for "quantum processors capable of detecting chronological anomalies" momentarily elevating diction beyond her stressed POV in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms time-dilation tropes through specific scientific framing ("consciously wild methodology") and emotional truth in her shift from anger to understanding, avoiding generic abstraction with verifiable details like ink's quantum behavior.</comment>
