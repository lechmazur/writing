<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (memory vs creation) drives choices; embodied grief via charcoal-stained fingers avoids labels. Epiphany earned through Maya's note and cave drawing, with visible cost in "could never perfectly recall making." No therapy-speak in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: leaving memory safety for creation, cost legible in irreversible cave drawing. Accumulative lens holds via sensory buildup to resonant final image. Orientation clear by 100 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains choices (narrowing passages, drawing surface) and charges final image. Charcoal under nails mixes with stone—micro-setting shapes tactics and closure. Sensory details filtered through artist POV avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory vs creation) tightens through protagonist's agency: finding paint, interpreting note, drawing on cave wall. Cost crystallizes in irreversible act ("could never perfectly recall making"). Escalation via sensory deepening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: charcoal transforming into color, crystals humming. Final image reweights "rectify imbalance" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Maya's note states goal but closure shows earned shift through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: artist notices pigments, refractions, tactile stone. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Lyra's fingers flew"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "grief like charcoal dust" and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("cadmium yellow on crystalline purple" does triple duty). No figurative muddle—final line's "aurora of colors" charges prior motifs. Sentence rhythm accelerates during creation scene without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via artist-specific logic (mnemonic gift as barrier). Charcoal/stone fusion feels inevitable, not quirky. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
