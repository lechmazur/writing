<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "walls between thoughts" reflection vs quantum realization; embodied "laser button warm under thumb" avoids therapy-speak. Chen backstory anchors present choice but slight convenience in timing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("revolutionize her guarded heart"); causal lens holds from anomaly discovery to phone call. "Light pass through" crystallizes irreversible stance shift with relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent barriers constrain choice (detecting anomalies) and charge final image ("let light pass through"). Spongy substrate enables silent movement; laser's refraction teaches quantum rules through action not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (security vs connection) tightens via quantum discovery narrowing options to call Chen. Cost legible in "carefully guarded heart" revolution; agency drives escalation from detection to personal vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through laser/barrier physics: "boundaries don't have to be barriers" shown via fungal communication, not stated. Final image reweights mushrooms as "familiar strangers" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spatial modeling ("constructing 3D networks without computers"); rhythmic control in "burned through her like quiet wildfire." Dialogue carries subtext but "missing you" slightly over-articulated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "consuming old certainties with patient heat" risks cliché but redeemed by quantum context. Laser button repetition shows purposeful motif. Final paragraph propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fungal quantum entanglement transforms "familiar strangers" trope through bioluminescent communication. Emotional specificity in security specialist's walls vs mushrooms' bridges avoids abstraction; premise inseparable from voice.</comment>
