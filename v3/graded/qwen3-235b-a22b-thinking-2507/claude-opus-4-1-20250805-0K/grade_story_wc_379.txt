<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elena's embodied trauma ("tears fell like rain after drought") and Marta's quiet agency feel authentic, but Jorge/Mrs. Chen verge on archetypes with minimal internal contradiction. The micro-choice of extending the locket lands powerfully, though Elena's vocal recovery lacks sufficient struggle escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("This home") reconfigures meaning with visible cost (Elena's tears), but shelter transition lacks spatial anchoring early. Orientation Test passes via "Riverside" payoff, yet postal resolution feels slightly convenient, diluting escalation stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (neighbors gather there), with dawn light mirroring hope. Tarnished locket and sparrows' breadcrumbs charge the final image, though shelter scene lacks equivalent tactile specificity to fully constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering connection) tightens meaningfully through Marta's "Show me" agency, but postal solution escalates too smoothly without visible cost (e.g., bureaucratic hurdles). Elena's muteness breaking lacks sufficient friction to fully charge the final image under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through actions ("listening could unlock what seemed permanently sealed"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("This home") reweights the locket's meaning without stating a moral, with Sofia's letters providing concrete emotional aftereffect through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marta's perceptual signature shines ("curator's instinct"), but Jorge/Mrs. Chen dialogue converges in lexicon during shelter scene. "Sandstorm calm" motif modulates effectively, though filter verbs ("Marta understood") occasionally dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm with purposeful variation ("tears fell like rain after drought"), but minor synonym churn in shelter transition ("squatted gray against morning light" followed by "awakening streets"). No closure-impacting artifacts, though one template cadence weakens mid-beat propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "community heals" trope through specific mechanics (17 letters, postal records) and avoids sentimentality via Elena's muteness. The locket-mailbox connection feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
