<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Viktor's precise chess moves versus his anxious stone-worrying; the dent's transfer to Mira crystallizes earned renunciation with tactile cost. "Beauty lives in difficulty" echoes as embodied wisdom, not therapy-speak, avoiding diagnostic labels in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as flawless Charged Poise: Viktor's "I stay" crystallizes options with visceral cost in the stone transfer, while aurora correlates with magnetic field reweighting exile as home. Orientation anchors by word 15; accumulative lens holds through density of magnetic/chess correlations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus actively constrains choice—the magnetite/quartz board forces impossible positions that mirror Viktor's dilemma. Auroral correlation charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate as environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single deepening suffices: Mira's "Will you leave us?" crystallizes Viktor's stance, narrowing options to renounce title. Cost is unmistakable in stone transfer and "gift disguised as exile" line, driven entirely by protagonist agency under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-magnetism correlations, not abstraction; final line "finding home in the spaces others called exile" reweights premise without moralizing. Mira's earned insight ("beauty in impossible positions") avoids thematic echo by showing, not telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: Viktor notices magnetic effects before chess implications ("knights leaned toward north"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical twilight to terse gameplay; dialogue distinct with Mira's simplicity versus Viktor's complexity. Minor register drift in "thoughtfully precise arrogance" contained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story (e.g., "pieces sliding mysteriously" shows nexus while setting up board play). Figurative language sparse but potent ("light bleed from sky"). Slight register lift in "hopeful melancholy" saved by "hard-won" grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess as universal language via magnetic board transforms trope. Emotional specificity in quiet renunciation (vs. triumphant return) avoids abstraction. "Correlating silences" made literal through magnetism creates non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
