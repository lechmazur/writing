<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Marcus’s thumb-cutting micro-choice while turning the disc, embodying his tension between connection and distance; Eleanor’s “made her up” admission avoids diagnostic labels through embodied vocal cracks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Marcus’s “endings are beginnings” line crystallizes their limbo with visceral cost (Eleanor’s shattered voice); Accumulative lens holds as tunnel acoustics deepen the estrangement stake without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel’s electromagnetic fields actively constrain choices—disc hums against trains, minutes loop—charging the final image; utility tunnel isn’t backdrop but functional micro-setting altering Marcus’s tactics through spatial acoustics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marcus’s agency in cultivating disconnection; Eleanor’s admission of fabricated memories delivers felt cost, but escalation lacks one visible trade-off (e.g., disc damage or missed call) to elevate beyond deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Eleanor’s “made her up” revelation reweighting “endings as beginnings” without moralizing; final image’s “beautifully lost” practice crystallizes the answer, though Marcus’s line risks slight thematic echo without sharper irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in Marcus’s selective attention to vibrations and silence; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—Eleanor’s fragmented speech (“Does she?”) contrasts Marcus’s lyrical cadence without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: “melodically haunted” evolves from description to embodied trait in Eleanor’s voice cracks; final line’s “singing its ancient frequency” recharges the disc motif with layered propulsion, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms “wrong number” trope through tunnel’s physics-driven estrangement; risk-taking (time dilation, disc as tool) heightens stakes coherently, with Marcus’s thumb-cut revealing irreplaceable specificity in the closure beat.</comment>
