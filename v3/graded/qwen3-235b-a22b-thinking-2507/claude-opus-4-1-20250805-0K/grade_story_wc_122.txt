<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines through "numbness wrapped around her heart like scar tissue" and bone-deep vibrations; micro-choices (jury-rigging needle, palm placement) reveal contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. Final transformation earned by tactile causality but edges toward over-articulation in closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("emotional permafrost cracking") under Accumulative lens; density escalation via vibration patterns reweights stakes perfectly. Orientation anchors by word 5, but final thematic echo ("sometimes we must move in reverse...") slightly softens the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cavern walls actively constrain choices (natural amplification enabling bone conduction) and charge closure ("footsteps creating their own rhythm"). Every detail—stone floor, cool air, fractured needle—serves tactile urgency without static description, meeting 9+ gate through environment-driven tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Lucia’s agency (backward playback trials) deepens the dominant stake (numbness vs. connection) via vibration density shifts. Cost legible in "fractured tip worn down," though the single pressure point lacks a secondary complicating turn for 9.5+ under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "filament of hush" physics and marrow-deep resonance, avoiding moralizing until the final paragraph’s near-echo ("sometimes we must move in reverse...") risks slight thematic overstatement despite earned context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fingers reading air’s pressure changes") and bone-conduction syntax ("notes arriving before their birth") create unmatched rhythmic control. Zero head-hopping; stress compression ("crawled up through her bones") heightens pressure without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wounded path through grooves" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "profound music of vibration" abstraction, instantly redeemed by "marrow, waiting patiently for those who listen with their bones"—no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms deafness trope via vibration physics and backward-play mechanics; "mirrored hush" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Risk-taking (soundless music) heightens stakes coherently, with drum maker’s ghosts charging closure beyond surface novelty.</comment>
