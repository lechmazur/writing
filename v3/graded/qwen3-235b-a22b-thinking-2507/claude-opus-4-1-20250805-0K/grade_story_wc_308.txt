<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "movement was mastery" past vs present stillness, but "true navigation happened in stillness" risks diagnostic label-speak; embodied cost in weathered resolve saves closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"I am still here" crystallizes centuries of endurance with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through echoing pulse resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bone towers function as active micro-setting: their "hollow cores" preserving echoes directly constrain Yula's stillness tactic and charge the final heartbeat image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through vulture/swallow patterns escalating pressure; her synchronization choice forecloses movement with visible cost—centuries of dust as embodied sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "navigating the universe from her single point" reweights stillness as active journey without moralizing; avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless—"ghost of one" for pulse, dust as "second skin"—rhythm modulates with pressure; lyric compression taught early via canyon's "endless conversation."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "grain a year" metaphor multiplies purpose without muddle; final line’s "heartbeat of deep time" crystallizes closure with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "stone skimmer" trope via acoustic time navigation; risk-taking (stillness as agency) heightens stakes without gimmickry, rooted in bone-tower logic.</comment>
