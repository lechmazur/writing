<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (claustrophobia vs duty) embodied in "walls pressing inward" and "throat swallowing her"; micro-choice to push deeper despite panic earns closure. Marcus's static presence limits relationship crucible despite strong individual interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("She would return every year... journal pressed against her chest") crystallizes stance with visceral cost ("carrying memory... like a prayer"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density; tidal pressure tightens options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded corridors actively constrain movement ("each meter" tightening); phase chamber's amber light and gold flecks charge final image. Sensory selection narrows under pressure ("sonar rig pinged softly" during crisis).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal promise to global protection ("digital cancer" threat). Tidal clock forces irreversible choice; cost legible in "carrying memory... like a prayer" as Elena accepts eternal vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gold flecks reweighted from map decoration to "constellations" of memory. Final image ("heart that no longer beat but still remembered") answers "remember us" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water like amber preservative") persists under stress; rhythmic control in "clean emptiness" climax. No head-hopping; compression taught early via map fragments pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ten billion conversations" crystallizes density. Minor overwriting in "neural pathways of a sleeping giant" (0.3 deduction) but closure lines ("breathed deep... like a prayer") propel flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms undersea cable trope through "digital cancer" specificity and phase-shifted memory. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors sci-fi premise.</comment>
