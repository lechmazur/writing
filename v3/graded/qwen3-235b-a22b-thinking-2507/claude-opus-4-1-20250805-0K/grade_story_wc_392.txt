<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot's internal conflict between observer and participant crystallizes through the lantern's memories, with resignation as earned renunciation. Jerome's backstory shows authentic contradiction (ghost vs man), though "spiritual death" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "baptized by the storm" crystallizes her stance shift with visible cost (resignation, broken observer wall). Orientation anchors by line 25; Accumulative lens holds as memories intensify pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lantern as micro-setting constrains every choice (handling, memory triggers) and charges the final image. Subway tunnel's physicality shapes tactics (echoes, grates), though occupational details lack precision without harming closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (breaking bondage) tightens when Margot realizes Jerome died from "heart too full," reframing the death. Cost is unmistakable (resignation, system rejection), though escalation leans slightly passive via lantern revelations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lantern's history without moralizing; final image of "shadows that looked like all the people" resonates as non-literal answer. Avoids pitfalls but "spiritual death" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (noticing brass wear, heartbeat sounds) modulates under pressure. Minor register drift with "baptized by the storm" slightly mars climax, but rhythmic control in memory sequences elevates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No major loops, but "spiritual death" and paraphrase-loop ("calm precision"/"calmly") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. Propulsion strong except minor scaffold in reflection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms Underground Railroad trope through specific modern bondage (workplace control). Risk-taking (memory mechanics) heightens stakes coherently; "heart too full" insight feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
