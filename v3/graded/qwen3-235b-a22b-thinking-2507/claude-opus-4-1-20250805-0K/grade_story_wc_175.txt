<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (“overlooked histories persisted like seeds”) is concrete and embodied through micro-choices (knot patterns, stem-bending), but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; closure choice (honoring impermanence) is earned though internal tension remains subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: monarch’s departure crystallizes the cost (“would die before reaching destination”) while dissolving structures reconfigure impermanence as honor; Accumulative lens holds with “interrupted cadence” pattern tightening meaning under moisture’s pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Grotto’s moisture enables the story’s core action (dissolving structures), yet fails to constrain specific choices beyond atmospheric texture; “prisms hanging like unfinished sentences” shows vivid sensory hierarchy but doesn’t alter tactics or charge closure decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Mira’s agency: knotting stems creates signals that attract the monarch, narrowing options to one final act; cost (“faintest trace of presence”) is unmistakable in the dissolving structures and butterfly’s doomed flight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (dissolving monuments) and final image (“interrupted cadence continued in spaces between remembered and allowed to fade”), reweighting impermanence as honor without moralizing; avoids all anti-patterns through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature (“powdery scales catching filtered light”) and rhythmic control, though “blushing stillness” description lacks modulation during monarch’s arrival; no head-hopping, but tension peak slightly flattens voice texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in opening (“mosses draped like curtains and ferns sprouted from crevices that wept perpetual dew”) creates scaffold; otherwise high density with no figurative muddle, though “air itself might bruise” edges toward stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms “honoring erased histories” through specific, grounded choices (moth-scale braille, dissolving knots); risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently, with closure image (“beauty that wouldn’t last”) feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
