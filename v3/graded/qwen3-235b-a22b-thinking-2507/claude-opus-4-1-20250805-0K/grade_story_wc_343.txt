<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "dustily curious nature" driving her isolation versus Guild sociability; final renunciation of "discovery" for "rediscovery" carries felt conceptual cost in the phrasebook's child's sketch, though minor abstraction in "dustily curious" slightly dilutes embodiment during peak realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: her shift from "great discovery" to "rediscovery" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost in the final line ("translating their luminous language"), perfectly sustaining the accumulative/textural lens through pattern density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hopscotch board constrains choice repeatedly (tracing constellations, decoding sequences) and charges the final image via the margin sketch, elevating micro-setting beyond atmosphere; minor deduction as airship’s brass hull/rigging whispers don’t actively pressure tactics during the breakthrough.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: her noting patterns directly triggers the breakthrough ("They're writing"), narrowing options from passive observation to active translation; the conceptual cost of humility ("she hadn't discovered anything") reweights stakes decisively, though winter’s approach lacks tangible pressure on immediate choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the phrasebook’s evolution from "seventeen dead languages" to the child’s sketch, with the final image ("rediscovery of what we had lost") offering resonant non-literal closure; nearly flawless but "rediscovery" phrasing edges toward thematic echo without sufficient image-based deflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature as cartographer ("traced fingers," "noted coordinates") creates rhythmic control under pressure, with syntax tightening during the murmuration breakthrough; minor deduction as "dustily curious nature" momentarily drifts from concrete observation into abstract labeling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "starlings contracted into a dense sphere, and there it was—a pulse of golden light" propels momentum; deduction for slight overwriting in "whispered conversations of wind through rigging" where atmospheric detail risks diluting the breakthrough beat’s urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms cartography tropes through specific synthesis (starlings as living maps, hopscotch as cipher), with emotional truth in Elara’s shift from ambition to humility; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes but the "Great Silence" backdrop lacks verifiable detail to push beyond strong execution.</comment>
