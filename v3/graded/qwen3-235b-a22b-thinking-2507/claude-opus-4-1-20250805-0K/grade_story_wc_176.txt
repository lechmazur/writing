<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "forgiveness hadn't ended her responsibility; it had revealed her true inheritance." Micro-choices like braiding with "technically gentle movements" reveal hierarchy of values under pressure, though backstory density slightly blurs present-frame urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "ice walls began to sweat" crystallizes temporal pressure. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—aurora pulse and rope vibrations reweight stakes through pattern recognition, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rope (tool) constrains choices and charges closure via "sweating" ice walls mirroring emotional release. Sensory hierarchy excels (caster notices "investment material"), but "aurora ribbons" borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: density increase in released names ("Aanyu" to ancestral "Elsa") reweights stakes under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in "tears freezing" and melting ice, though tightening leans slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bronze bells singing "saved names forever"—resonant non-literal answer to preservation. Avoids moralizing; "endless braid of preservation" saved by concrete rope linkage, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: caster notices "shed strands as lost wax." Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical discovery to fragmented climax ("She wept then"), though "ghost-echo" slightly strains voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "bronze still hummed with heat." Minor cliché ("tears of relief") prevents 8.8+, but closure beat ("ghost-echo... playing old names") remains clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: human-hair rope transforms "lost wax" metaphor into literal preservation mechanism. Risk-taking feels inevitable, though "endless braid" phrasing slightly echoes familiar tropes.</comment>
