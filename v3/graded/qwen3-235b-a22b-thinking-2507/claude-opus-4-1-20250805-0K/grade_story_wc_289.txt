<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira’s ghostwriting paradox—she crafts others’ love while hiding her own encoded messages—but Chen’s sudden confession of keeping her letters lacks sufficient prior causality for full emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: the installation’s reflection crystallizes "you are not alone" with undeniable social cost, under an Accumulative lens where pattern density reweights longing’s universality without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lotus temple’s reflective pond functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—doubling the installation to charge the final image—while rain-soaked marble petals anchor sensory urgency in Mira’s tactile work with wire.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency in revealing her notes and building the spiral, narrowing options to embrace shared vulnerability; the felt cost of universal loneliness crystallizes in Chen’s handhold as the stars appear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through the installation’s refracted light—no moralizing—where the pond’s double reflection becomes a resonant answer to "are we alone?" by reweighting solitude as shared humanity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mira’s perceptual signature—obsessing over spirals and light refraction—creates rhythmic control under pressure; dialogue carries subtext ("You ghost-write love, but never your own") while avoiding uniform tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic quiet" and "thrush’s nest reimagined in light" deliver high density without muddle, though "whimsy was wisdom wearing dancing shoes" risks slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghostwriting tropes through the thrush’s spiral motif—fresh synthesis where encoded glass slides in wire become inevitable proof of universal longing, avoiding sentimental middle-ground.</comment>
