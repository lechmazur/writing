<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (continuing vs. breaking the chain) manifest in visceral micro-choices; daughter's first word sacrificed before name shows hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("weight of that small body against her chest").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Mei's empty-looming smile with tear-formed bead crystallizes irreversible cost; bamboo's final growth reweights prior material under Accumulative lens. Cost ("unable to tell them her own name") legible in exact sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Loom functions as micro-setting: "hummed with recognition" constrains choice, while tear-formed bead charges final image. Bamboo's "held its breath" actively witnesses sacrifice, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mei's agency (weaving daughter's name last), but bamboo's "hunger" lacks coherent pressure development; raveling silence deepens stakes yet opposition remains atmospheric rather than actively narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final bead holding daughter's hair offers non-literal answer to "messages across impossible distance," reweighting "stoically sparkling" from object to sacrifice without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "silences speak louder" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "silence raveled like fabric unwoven"; rhythmic control under pressure ("thread pulled through reality's weave") with no head-hopping. Patterned elision (generational backstory) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "raveled, pulling apart at its edges" demonstrates textural specificity. Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" near closure but doesn't obscure cause/effect; peak beats avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms weaving trope through memory-sacrifice mechanic; "raveling silence" as active cost-system feels inevitable. Emotional specificity ("fevered but trusting" child) avoids generic templates while bamboo's witness elevates risk.</comment>
