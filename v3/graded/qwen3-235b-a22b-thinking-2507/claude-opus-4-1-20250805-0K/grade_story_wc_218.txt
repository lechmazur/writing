<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via tumor-as-bridge, but "remodel human perception" edges toward abstract summary. Trembling hands during final connection embody cost better than later conceptual phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: palm-on-pillar crystallizes stakes with visceral cost ("six months was an appointment"). Accumulative lens holds through copper network escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Copper wire functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tension levels, spiral directions) and charges the phosphorescent final image. "Living stone pillars" avoids genericism through electromagnetic specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when copper links to temple foundation, narrowing options to translation vs resort. Tumor's electromagnetic signature creates unavoidable trade-off: life for interspecies bridge, visible in final documentation act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through copper vibrations and stone phosphorescence, not moralizing. Final image reweights "remodel" into interspecies recognition without stating morals, though "monument to respect" borders abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: botanical precision ("cramped handwriting between pressed leaves") blends with neurological awareness. Rhythm modulates from systematic wiring to shuddering climax without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "copper wire vibrated... something shifted" demonstrates triple-duty propulsion. Final line ("monument to interspecies respect") risks abstraction but is redeemed by "slow collaboration of wood and stone" texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tumor-as-translation-tool transforms "dying mentor" trope through electromagnetic specificity. Avoids derivative pitfalls via copper mechanics and stone memory, though "architectural frequencies" slightly echoes common fantasy lexicon.</comment>
