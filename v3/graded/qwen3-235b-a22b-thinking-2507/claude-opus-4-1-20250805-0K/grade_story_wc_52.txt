<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not moving on—but moving with," rooted in tangible details like Thomas' marginalia. Embodied emotion via knife precision and transformed hands avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction for "crystallized time" bordering abstraction despite strong grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: the handless clock "hold[ing] time" reweights "here and gone" with undeniable cost in "steam rose... here and gone, but the warmth remained." Accumulative lens established early via kettle countdown and rain rhythms.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight actively pressures choices (shifting shadows on hands) and charges closure’s "rust-hued peace." Kettle steam mixing with wood scent makes micro-setting constrain carving pace. Deduct 0.2 for one borderline generic phrase ("shifting shadows").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Margaret’s agency: carving faster as kettle whistles narrows options, crystallizing "presence persists in spaces it once filled." Cost unmistakable in vanishing steam versus enduring warmth. "Crystallized time" concept risks slight abstraction but saved by physical clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—unwrapped paintings, lion’s roar—not moralizing. Final line "hold it" reweights "here and gone" with resonant non-literal answer. Deduct 0.1 only for "crystallized time" near-redundancy despite earned context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: wood grain viewed through botanical lens, Thomas’ laugh in zoo roars. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Two minutes, maybe less") flawless. Deduct 0.1 for purposeful but slightly repetitive "hauntingly practical" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("rain beaded... like tears that wouldn’t fall"). Final line’s rhythm crystallizes theme without muddle. "Crystallized time" phrasing risks abstraction but anchored by physical clock carving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms grief tropes: "moving with" not "on," handless clock as artifact. Avoids sentimentality via ash wood’s scent and steam. Deduct 0.2 as "crystallized time" concept isn’t wholly novel despite impeccable execution.</comment>
