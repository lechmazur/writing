<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in canine specifics (failing eyes, bloodhound bones) avoids anthropomorphism; contradictory impulses (distrust of nose vs ancestral gift) drive the final choice with visible cost of ending/starting retirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the howl crystallizes reconfigured stakes (finding bodies → guiding the living) with felt cost ("retirement had ended and begun simultaneously"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (waxed leaf) constrains choice and charges final image; Heap’s crushed automobiles pressure navigation, but "wild hush" motif lacks active constraint on tactics despite atmospheric consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: leaf’s chromatic compass narrows options to magnetic north-northwest; cost (end of retirement) is legible but secondary stake (bloodline key) remains underexplored, slightly diluting dominant grief-distance tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: "distance measured in grief" reweights the leaf’s symbolism without moralizing; final image (howl as summoning) offers resonant non-literal answer to scattering/connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scent-focused, rust/motor oil priority) modulates under stress; voice avoids human abstraction ("chromatic compass," "bloodhound bones"); minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("amber wax glowed like trapped sunlight" → functional map); slight overwriting in "glass craters" description, but no closure-impairing artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bloodhound courier mythology with grief-as-navigation; risk-taking (animal POV, non-human closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming post-apocalyptic tropes through sensory specificity.</comment>
