<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (destroying vs preserving evidence) manifest concretely in shredding clippings while saving water-stained letters. Final choice to integrate dual identities earned through cataloging method and meteorite talisman. Theodore's late reveal slightly undermines causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "preserving its echo in the vast archive of her healing heart." Accumulative lens holds through dust/music pattern reconfiguration. Backstory block risks reflection-led mode but anchors present via micro-choice (burning clippings).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Attic micro-setting constrains every choice: dust motes guide cataloging method, skylight frames pivotal moments. Final image of music "rising through floorboards like pigeons" charges closure through tactile specificity. "Brittle as autumn leaves" cliché prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake tightening occurs when preserved letter reveals her own training method, changing knowledge under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "blooming back into herself" with emotional forfeiture of clean reinvention. Accident backstory slightly dilutes dominant pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through paper trails/meteorite particulars: "truth lived not in official records but in spaces between words." Final image reweights premise without moralizing—cosmic debris finding purpose crystallizes "who we're becoming" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "dust motes became her meditation" with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from brittle to resonant across seasons. One filter verb ("she had discovered") in high-stakes beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat with high density ("mapping music's path through dusty air"). "Brittle as autumn leaves" cliché and slight telling ("became her meditation") prevent 9.0. Final paragraph propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes pigeon training with archival work into fresh reinvention trope. Meteorite chip as cosmic debris finding purpose transforms cliché through specific stakes. Risky lyric structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
