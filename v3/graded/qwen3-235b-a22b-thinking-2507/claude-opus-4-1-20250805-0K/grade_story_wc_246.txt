<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira's choice between redemption and truth; embodied through pen's weight. "Confidently uncertain" label triggers diagnostic-speak penalty (-0.4) mid-crisis, slightly undermining flaw authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: transmitting dual coordinates crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost (erased growth vs. saved lives). Hybrid lens holds from causal decoding to textural reconfiguration; cost proof explicit in "losing the three months of desperate searching".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Grandfather's pen functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (anchor against revision) and charging final image (drifting beside coordinates). Anomaly's selective filtering directly pressures tactics—environment shapes the climax without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: transmitting dual coordinates forecloses easy redemption with visceral cost. Escalation slightly softens mid-beat due to "confidently uncertain" abstraction, but climax's trade-off (truth vs. salvation) remains unmistakable under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "wrong seeds grow unexpected gardens" reweights struggle without moralizing. Final image crystallizes non-literal answer to central question—no thematic echo, just resonant reconfiguration of Mira's growth through cosmic editing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("tracing constellations of data"), but "confidently uncertain" injects corporate diction violating POV lexicon mid-crisis. Otherwise, rhythmic control under pressure (microgravity syntax) and consistent focalization elevate tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion flawless ("The bent light wasn’t just distorted—it was selectively filtered"). One paraphrase loop ("discovery started... until she'd noticed") earns -0.2, but closure beat remains pristine with crystalline density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "contingent relationships" physics made visceral through cosmic history-editing. Risk-taking (non-linear reality) heightens stakes coherently; emotional specificity in guilt-driven discovery avoids trope recycling. Transformation test passed.</comment>
