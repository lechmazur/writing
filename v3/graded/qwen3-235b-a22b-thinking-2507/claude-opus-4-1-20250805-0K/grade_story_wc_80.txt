<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "stoically sensitive" embodied through suppressed grief during bottle-sealing ritual; micro-choices like holding satchel high reveal hierarchy of values without therapy-speak. Avoids stock phrasing by grounding emotion in tactile details (barnacles, inkwell click).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "dreams are safe now" reweights absence through the bottled message, with the tangible three-month wait crystallizing temporal sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts from documentation to ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The inkwell constrains choices (dipping pen in rising water) and charges the final image ("click echoing"); submerged orchestra pit mirrors internal state through warped floorboards. Sensory hierarchy filters brackish water through surveyor’s tactile expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through tide’s pressure narrowing Edmund’s window, but the turning tide lacks causal teeth—it threatens time without physically impeding his ritual. Agency shines in bottle-sealing choice, though water’s encroachment feels atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" evolves from abstract concept to embodied truth through empty seats/silence, resolving in the final image where ripples become "witnessed absence." Avoids moralizing by letting the bottle’s fragility embody the theme’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in surveyor’s lexicon ("subsidence," "brackish water") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats (bottle-sealing). Compression of backstory via grandmother’s letters stays anchored in concrete cues like chandelier light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "crystals still catching light" does triple duty as image/motif/cost-signifier. Minor register drift in "archeologist of abandoned dreams" risks abstraction but is rescued by immediate physical action (wading through water).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms flood narrative through surveyor’s preservation rituals—notes in walls, bottled messages—making absence tangible. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via inkwell’s evolving significance without gimmickry.</comment>
