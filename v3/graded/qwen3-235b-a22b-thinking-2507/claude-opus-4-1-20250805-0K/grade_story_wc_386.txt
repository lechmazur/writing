<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (treasure to truth-seeking) through embodied choices like "wove truth carefully from fragmented messages," avoiding stock phrasing. Final choice to continue the mission is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the fading spirits' "purpose finally being fulfilled." Slight BRR excess in reflection block but anchored by micro-choice to transcribe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "ghosts had chosen their messenger well" crystallizes Marina's role amid fading spirits, reconfiguring the premise through "borrowed starlight" imagery. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—density increases via frost-pattern visions, pressure tightens through formula transcription without causal breaks. Cost legible in "spirits began their fade into morning light."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (snow globe) constrains choice: candlelight angle dependency forces precise action during transcription, charging the final image as "truth now exposed." Glacier shrine details ("rivulets into walls frozen for centuries") evolve causally with melting wax, avoiding static description. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Marina notices only what matters for decoding, like warped plastic edges through gloves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen under Accumulative lens as Marina transcribes: "twelve more globes" revelation narrows options from single mission to global responsibility, with visible cost in the chemist's fading ("purpose finally being fulfilled"). Pressure coheres through her agency—angle adjustment for light, careful transcription—not coincidence. Moral calculus sharpens in "precious cargo disguised as wreckage," weighing truth against emotional burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging meaning emerges through concrete action: melted snow globe's "dream architecture" encodes hope, while final image ("windows of connection opened in unexpected places") reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; insights earned via "fifteen years" struggle. Emotional aftereffect lingers through "salvage artist of impossible things"—complex resonance where purity coexists with wreckage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "frost patterns... emerging and receding like breath on glass," reflecting Marina's ghost-whisperer lens. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during transcription ("Show me," "She began transcribing"). Slight register drift in "salvage artist" phrasing, but consistent with her role. No POV leakage; focalization stays anchored in tactile details like diving gloves.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; sentences vary rhythm for propulsion ("Marina pressed... feeling its warped plastic edges"). High density: "candlelight like borrowed starlight" does triple duty (setting, theme, closure). No figurative muddle in peak beats—transcription scene uses concrete verbs ("began," "understanding"). Final line "carrying borrowed starlight" recharges opening motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms ghost trope: snow globe as data storage for antidote formula, "windows of connection" as collective unconscious interface. Emotional truth in Marina's quiet dedication ("not just wreck-diver or ghost whisperer"). Risk-taking heightens stakes—biological weapon backstory feels fresh through specific Arctic context and "dream architecture" decoding. Avoids safety middle via moral ambiguity of "something worse than war."</comment>
