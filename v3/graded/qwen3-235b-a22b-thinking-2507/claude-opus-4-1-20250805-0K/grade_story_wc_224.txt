<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied sensation ("ache of kneeling," "smell of rain"), avoiding stock phrasing. Contradictory impulses—craving visions versus painful memories—drive her journey downward. Final choice earned via tactile memory of soil, though scholar delivery feels like off-page convenience slightly weakening causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: abandoning mercury visions for planting carries felt cost ("memories hurt") and forecloses prophecy path. Accumulative lens holds—sensory accumulation crystallizes into "Charged Poise" at soil chamber. Cost proof: "memories hurt" paired with planting action makes sacrifice undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: blindness transforms leather spines and stone texture into active constraints that guide her choices. Soil chamber’s dark earth charges the final image, though its late arrival (after 40% mark) narrowly misses 9+ gate despite reweighting the closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her physical descent—agency-driven escalation as stone guides her toward soil. Dominant stake (reclaiming self vs prophecy) narrows options when she plants, with visceral cost ("memories hurt") altering tactics. Minor deduction: scholar’s delivery slightly softens opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "buried talents" motif: stone’s "memory of seeds" becomes word-blooming plants, answering "shape of home" without moralizing. Final image reweights prophecy as growth ("she grew it from seeds"), avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("felt stories through worn bindings," "texture of a feather") reflects blindness. Rhythmic control peaks in high-pressure beats: "Something thundered... not sound but possibility" compresses diction without losing texture. Patterned elision taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences layer meaning ("mercury rippled... reflecting not her face but the shadow"). "Hidden thunder" slightly overwrought but fits tone. Final image recharges stone motif with precision—"feather-soft yet eternal" dissolving into soil—elevating closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: oracle’s buried gardening talent manifests as literal word-blooming plants. Avoids trope through specific, verifiable details (silver-blind navigation, bark-page books). Emotional truth in "satisfaction of first green shoots" elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
