<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied action (decoding knots under time pressure) and contradictory impulses (scholarly precision vs grief for lost fisherman). Final choice to teach granddaughter earned by prior causality, though "eternal truth" phrasing slightly over-articulates epiphany. No second character present limits relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (fragility of tacit knowledge) when Mara plans to pass on rope knowledge. Fog lifting crystallizes options without sentimentality, but "eternal truth" risks thematic echo. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow actively constrains choices (snow dissolving mirrors knowledge urgency, fog enables focus) and charges final image. Recurring objects (rope, fulgurite) evolve causally with decoding progress. Meets 9+ gate with micro-setting shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vanishing knowledge) signaled immediately through rope's "final record." Escalation via decoding progression (storm patterns → rock mapping) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Visible cost in fisherman's death and time pressure ("by morning") drives agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (knot math, fulgurite physics), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "secret weavers" as natural emergence without stated moral. "Eternal truth" phrasing skirts thematic echo but redeemed by actionable teaching plan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tactile marine details ("numbed fingers," barnacle patterns) and compressed rhythm during decoding ("Seven loops over, three under"). Slight register drift in "philosophical seed collector" but balanced by concrete actions. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("fog thickened... fog began to lift") and repetitive "infinite patience" phrasing. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but "weathered planks" generic. Final line avoids cliché through concrete verbs ("rolling eternal").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime knowledge preservation with scientific concepts (fulgurite, fractals). Transformation test passed: swapping "knots" for "carvings" would break tactile decoding process. Avoids romanticizing through practical applications (storm prediction).</comment>
