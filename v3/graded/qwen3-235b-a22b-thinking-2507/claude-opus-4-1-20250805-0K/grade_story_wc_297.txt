<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "root-bound" as strength, not flaw; embodied emotion ("electricity through water") avoids labels; final choice earned by grandmother's seed-collecting parallel with visible cost in trembling hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: signing covenant crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("roots and wings finally the same"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern escalation; orientation anchored by word 5 with cobalt glade's sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cobalt glade actively constrains choices—kneeling triggers grass parting, final pulse charges closure; blue hour's deepening pressures timing; "waxy leaves" and "scars in earth" function as micro-setting driving action without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density: clipping warms → grass parts → maze grows → scars revealed; dominant stake (preserving time's fabric) tightens through Mira's agency; cost legible in scarred future-self and trembling hands at covenant signing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions ("linking through scars"), not abstraction; final image reweights "root-bound" limitation into "roots and wings same thing" without moralizing; "anxious elation" pulse charges resonant answer to time's fracture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices "waxy leaves bend but not break," compresses under stress ("She knelt and pressed"); rhythm modulates from lyrical ("scattered sapphires") to urgent short sentences; zero filter verbs or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver lines hanging like cat's cradle" exemplifies high-density imagery; sentence rhythm accelerates with "roots spreading outward," breathes in covenant description; no figurative muddle in peak signing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via "root-bound" lens; cobalt glade's specificity avoids genericity; "linking through scars" as navigation method feels fresh; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's cost.</comment>
