<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (daylight documentation vs. nocturnal truth) drive her final choice to paint unseen tenders' hands; cost of deferred revelation legible in stained fingertips carrying "a gift she hadn't yet given" without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sensory density (shifting pigments, resin luminescence) tightens into Charged Poise closure where snowfall crystallizes understanding; cost undeniable in "fingertips stained with phosphorescent paint" as she leaves postcards for future discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber resin and postcards function as micro-setting—constraining tactics (night-only visibility) and charging closure when left behind "edges barely visible," transforming the pavilion into a dormant bulb holding "summer and darkness in equal measure."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stake (uncovering postcards' purpose) deepens through seasonal work; agency-driven escalation (resin mixing, candlelight choices) narrows options to night-only creation, with felt cost in deferred witness as she walks away knowing "someone... would see what bloomed in darkness."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "beauties that refuse the sun's scrutiny" reweighted by final image of postcards hidden for "child staying past closing," avoiding moralizing while answering "why flowers bloom at night" with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "pigments that seemed to shift," "world hushed itself toward winter" filters all observation; rhythmic control peaks in closure cadence ("soft as petals, patient as the moon's slow journey") without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "copper roof catching last light like a held breath" demonstrates textural specificity; final line’s metaphor ("patient as the moon's slow journey") charges closure without muddle, achieving high density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "artist finds inspiration" trope through generational secret-keeping (postcards as instructions) and emotional specificity—universals anchored in "phosphorescent paint" and "loose panel," avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
