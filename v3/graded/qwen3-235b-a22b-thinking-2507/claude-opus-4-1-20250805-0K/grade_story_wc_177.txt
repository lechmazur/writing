<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "precisely playful smile as survival mechanism," but Kira's fatalism lacks visible struggle during neural interface activation; motivation ("discover why") needs friction against storm urgency to earn final acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost in "tasting rust and time" and "gritty truth that all foresight is hindsight"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through temporal paradox buildup to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and wafer seal constrain choices (seal as exit marker), but storm's "seventeen minutes" isn't tactically leveraged; micro-setting via neural crown's "crystalline nodes" charges closure with trapped stars imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake tightening falters—Kira follows pre-visions without adapting to storm's countdown, making flood threat passive pressure; conceptual cost ("becoming the child") lands but lacks visceral tactical tradeoffs during escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "rust-tasting seal" and backward footprints; avoids moralizing with earned resonance in final line's metaphor, reweighting "paths choose walkers" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles ("moss painted walls in ghostly blues"), but "scientist named Chen" breaks POV modesty; rhythmic control under pressure flawless despite minor register drift in "quantum processors."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "thunder shook dust like tears of iron" exemplifies high-density propulsion; only scaffold risk is "could see everything... never understood why" slightly telling before showing in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope through sensory grit (rust taste, moss-light), avoiding derivative pitfalls; "paths choose walkers" gains fresh weight via Chen's quantum dreams, making philosophical risk feel inevitable.</comment>
