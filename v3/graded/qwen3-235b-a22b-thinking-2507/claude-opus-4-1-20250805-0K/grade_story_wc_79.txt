<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (dread vs. need to know) manifest in micro-choices like chart-scattering during translation; flaw-driven compulsion to map the unmapable earns closure's cost without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "deep, geological groan" of waking turtles; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through spiral-pattern escalation with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turtle shells function as micro-setting constraining choice (maintenance hatch access) and charging final image; "sunlight felt heavy" modulates dread through embodied perception without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency decoding the crack, foreclosing safety with visceral cost ("sunlight pressing down with dread" paid in "geological groan"); single escalation suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("would map whatever came next") reweights cartography as existential necessity without moralizing; theme emerges from spiral-language particulars rather than abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("mathematical perfection," "pattern languages") persists under stress with rhythmic control; "ink bleeding where hand trembled" shows not tells interiority without filter-verb dilution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "salt-thick air like a prayer unanswered" earns poetic density through acoustic architecture payoff; final line's cadence recharges "spiral-shell cartographer" with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Turtle-city trope transformed via pattern-language cartography; emotional truth in mapping compulsion feels specific ("twelve sleeping turtles" not generic giants) without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
