<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("calibrated treason" vs "unfinished transformation") culminates in authentic confession with embodied cost—blood on thorn, burning documents. Near-cliché "pearl of blood" slightly undercuts specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: burning forgeries transforms "calibrated treason" into honesty that "sharper than any forged blade." Stalactites' rhythm anchors the felt cost of surrendering her craft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sanctuary constrains choice—dripping stalactites time the "pearl twilight" decision, aurora light reveals grandmother's inscription. Marble altar's physicality charges the key's activation and confession's final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single deepening suffices: "pearl twilight" arrival intensifies pressure, narrowing options to truth or lie. Brother's life as dominant stake is viscerally felt, though escalation relies heavily on internal shift rather than external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—burning forgeries reweights "calibrated treason" as self-betrayal. Final image (genuine signature mattering more than forgeries) answers central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: calligrapher's precision shapes syntax ("tools arranged with precision of weapons"). Minor register drift in "wisely enduring" label slightly dilutes voice during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats, but verbatim repetition of "stalactites dripped their patient rhythm" creates scaffold. Otherwise flawless propulsion—"flames took them equally" crystallizes thematic shift with visceral clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" transforms spy tropes through moral specificity—forging peace treaties versus condemning brother. Rose thorn elevates beyond archetype via blood oath weight and confession anchor, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
