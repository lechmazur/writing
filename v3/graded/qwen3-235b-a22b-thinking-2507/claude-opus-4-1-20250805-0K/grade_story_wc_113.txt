<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation (completing Elisabetta’s music) intensifies organically under dismissal pressure; embodied emotion when stepping deeper into flood shows contradictory impulses (drowning vs. artistic duty). Flaw: "lately inspired" trait lacks deeper conflict beyond others’ skepticism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the self-sustaining note and restored program crystallize the "in between" cost (Marcus’s temporal displacement). Accumulative lens holds—density increases via water reflections, with cost legible in "perfectly dry, holding a restored program" (Q2 cost proof test passed).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flooded pit actively constrains choices (water depth forcing Marcus chest-deep) and charges closure (water’s reflection enabling ghostly orchestra). Final image of restored program reweights the setting’s role, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (finishing the interrupted note) tightens through Marcus’s agency: transcribing, then playing in rising water. Escalation culminates in visceral cost (near-drowning to sustain the bow), reconfiguring options under accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"In between spaces" theme emerges through concrete actions (pit’s liminal role, water reflections), not abstraction. Final image—the dual-dated program—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Marcus notices water’s "shivering" surface and "trembling reflection," filtering details through musician’s bias. Rhythmic control peaks during the play sequence ("suspended between drowning and playing"), with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("violin case floating beside him like a patient dog" fuses character/setting). Minor scaffold: "The water damage wasn’t destroying it—it was revealing something else entirely" slightly over-explains, dulling immediacy in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story tropes: Elisabetta’s need isn’t remembrance but artistic completion. Risk-taking with quiet closure (note continuing post-play) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming "in between" from theme to causal driver.</comment>
