<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically ("throat closed around words sharp as card edges") while micro-choices (palming the crack, laying cards) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final acceptance of time's mercy earned through grandmother's hidden pattern, with visible cost in "choking beauty" of reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost in "choking beauty of time's strange mercy" reconfiguration. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (crack sealing) and cadence shift ("cards fell like black snow") reweight dominant stake. Orientation clear by word 50 with cloudbound glade anchoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Saucer crack functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must place palm over it) and charges final image (sealing with starlight). Silver grass chiming and transparent apology-leaves directly pressure ritual tactics, avoiding ornamental description through causal integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfastening birth-shadowed-by-death) tightens through Accumulative density: card-laying intensifies ritual while "midnight rain" glimpses deepen emotional cost. Agency-driven escalation culminates in crack sealing, with conceptual price ("choking beauty") charging final image under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: traced hands as cartomancer's map, not stated moral. Final reflection-shifting image reweights "accumulated time" without sentimentality, avoiding thematic echo through earned resonance in "invisible ink" birth announcement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of lilacs and lightning") with rhythmic control under pressure: short staccato sentences during card-laying ("The cards fell like black snow"). Patterned elision (hospital corridor detail) taught early and paid off in closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold—every phrase advances atmosphere ("silver grass that chimed when touched"). Figurative language precise in peak beats ("words sharp as card edges"), final line recharging "traced hands" motif with devastating simplicity. No loops or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific logic: birthday hand-tracings become cartomancer's guide to reclaimed time. Emotional truth in "choking beauty" avoids sentimentality; fresh synthesis feels inevitable through ritual mechanics and glade's physical rules.</comment>
