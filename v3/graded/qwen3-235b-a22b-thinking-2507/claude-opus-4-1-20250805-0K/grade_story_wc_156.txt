<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("methodical nature warred with playfulness") feels underdeveloped; the pivotal coin-flip choice lacks visible struggle between restoration duty and wonder, reducing earnedness of her renunciation despite strong embodied details like trembling brush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: "Sound Wave Garden" setting revealed too late (~180 words) without functional disorientation payoff; otherwise perfect Accumulative/Textural closure with felt cost in her active resealing of the coin and painted-over spiral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sound Wave Garden micro-setting brilliantly constrains choice—acoustic panels enable the frozen-pause climax and coin-flip's multiplicity; "reflected sound" mechanics directly charge the final image of cyclical discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (certainty vs wonder) deepen effectively through the coin's alternating faces, but the cost of sealing the magic feels underweighted; Elena's smooth pivot to playfulness lacks the visceral trade-off escalation demands under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids thematic echo by embodying "cyclical discovery" through resealing the coin; final image of the waiting nickel reweights the premise with conceptual cost, though the "treasures meant to be found" line skirts moralizing but is saved by action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brush trembled," "voice fracturing into harmonics") persists under pressure; rhythmic control in the frozen-pause sequence showcases intentional compression without head-hopping, teaching the temporal distortion pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("methodically uncovering layers beneath layers") and borderline bodily cliché ("playfulness rising in her chest"); otherwise exceptional density where every line advances atmosphere or tension, especially the garden's acoustic mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop tropes through specific sensory mechanics (acoustic panels bending whispers) and Elena's restorer perspective; the "nested awakenings" concept feels inevitable via the mural's physical layers and coin's dual faces.</comment>
