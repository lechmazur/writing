<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "preemptive nostalgia" physicality and summer-quill's truth-resonance requirement; embodied choice to write terror/beauty earns closure without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: lightning illuminating faces during ritual crystallizes irreversible stakes ("fog-stone may never release") with undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt actively constrains choices (writing requires "truth resonance"); observatory micro-setting shapes every tactic with "only highest peaks accessible" pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Lyra realizes nostalgia itself defines humanity, foreclosing passive preservation; visible cost ("fog-stone may never release") reweights options under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights lightning from "silent theater" to "ancient fire" illuminating ritual, answering "what makes us human" through embodied action without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "shadows told stories - short ones from recent traumas"; rhythmic compression under pressure ("We must conjecture") avoids syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "alabaster seas that trapped entire cities" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; minor abstraction ("building themselves anew") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms memory-archive trope through shadow-length metrics and "preemptive nostalgia" as active humanizing force; specificity avoids generic "collective memory" treatment.</comment>
