<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "elegant cruelty and kindness intertwined" without label-speak; micro-choices like carving plans anonymously reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: carved plans left for factions to "discover" crystallize interdependence with undeniable conceptual cost ("wouldn't claim credit" for anonymity).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Amphitheater's "stone lungs" breathing constrains Mara's solution timing; the surveyor's chain charges the final image ("kissed the chain before coiling it away") while shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency analyzing resin types, culminating in the "elegant cruelty" insight; cost legible in her tremble and forced anonymity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "encrypted compassion" motif—resin binding envelope becomes hidden care in floodgate design—avoiding moralizing with final water-flow image reweighting prior conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in thermal rhythm observations; rhythmic control under pressure ("She began to tremble...") with purposeful compression taught early via "stone lungs" metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "stone lungs" metaphor sustains clarity while multi-tasking (setting/character/theme); only minor overwriting in "elegant cruelty and kindness intertwined" slightly dulls peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcanic patience as active teacher; risk-taking in quiet climax (carved plans) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming mediator trope through generational chain logic.</comment>
