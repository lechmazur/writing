<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's embodied rebellion through drumming micro-choices feels authentic, though Dr. Chen's underutilized presence slightly weakens relationship dynamics. Her contradictory impulses (compliance vs. encoded resistance) intensify credibly under dissolution pressure, culminating in earned closure through physical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with undeniable cost ("Mira felt her body failing in the physical world"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation. One tightening—releasing the drumming pattern—sufficiently inverts the system while maintaining causal integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as essential micro-setting, constraining Mira's drumming tactics and charging the final image ("sang with voices that would never be silenced"). Sensory specificity in acoustic flowers and auric lagoon avoids symbolism clichés while shaping the closure's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early (harvesting vs. creating consciousness), with Mira's agency driving the inversion through drumming subnet. The physical cost of dissolution remains viscerally felt while reconfiguring options into collective creation, satisfying escalation under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from drumming and auroral sorrow without moralizing; the nursery metaphor reweights memory preservation into generative creation. Final image ("transformed it into a nursery for dreams") delivers resonant non-literal closure that avoids thematic echo while embracing conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct sound-centric perceptual signature ("frequencies only the dying could hear") maintains rhythmic control under pressure, with patterned elision (drumming setup) taught early. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to transcendent harmony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high-density prose ("auroral sorrow, each wave carrying fragments of lives interrupted") advances plot and theme simultaneously. Figurative language in peak beats ("releasing the pattern... possibilities crystallize") remains clear while accelerating momentum toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tech tropes through drumming-as-resistance creates emotional specificity. The sound wave garden's transformation from cage to nursery feels inevitable yet surprising, with risk-taking (collective dissolution as victory) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
