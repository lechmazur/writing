<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("prudently adventurous") drives micro-choices like compass use during descent; claustrophobia embodied through breathing focus rather than labels. Final transformation earned by causal chain but "mournful melody" slightly over-tells emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation flawless with "geometric wound in earth" by para 2. Causal chain (blueprint → music → nexus → revelation) tightens options meaningfully. Cost crystallized in "walls still pressed close, but he understood them differently" though "eternal dance" distracts minimally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Compass constrains choices (guides descent, pocketed during fear) and charges closure as "two compass points waited to draft new blueprints." Blueprint's glow during organ music directly alters navigation tactics in shifting corridors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conquer claustrophobia to gain knowledge) tightens when music "transfixes" him in shifting corridors. Cost is visceral—fear persists but transforms—but organ music's origin slightly convenient as pressure source.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" concept reweights reality through Marcus's final understanding ("space itself could be convinced to change"). Theme emerges implicitly via "proof that prudent adventure could unlock impossibilities" avoiding moralizing, though "wistful anthem" borders thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "corners that hurt to perceive directly" and tactile compass details. Rhythm accelerates during descent ("walls pressed closer"), slows at revelation. Minor deduction for "eternal dance" cliché marring otherwise controlled stress modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "organ music drifted through the stone" does triple duty (sound, setting, theme). Final line "orchestrate new mutinies" crystallizes theme perfectly. Slight overwriting in "mournful melody that spoke of abandoned sanctuaries" dulls one peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Claustrophobia-as-asset ("plan every escape route") transforms spatial exploration trope. Emotional truth in fear/transcendence balance avoids generic rebellion. Freshness capped as "spatial mutiny" concept slightly familiar despite strong execution.</comment>
