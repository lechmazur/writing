<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; interiority remains professional rather than character-particular. "Hazy precision" shows struggle but no embodied emotional contradiction beyond disorientation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (expanding convergence, six-month timeline). Accumulative lens holds: wind observations accumulate density toward crystallizing understanding of time-dilated field.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain movement and warp physically at convergence point. The patch charges the final image when held to light, reweighting its meaning from evidence to symbol of future adaptation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Maya measures convergence expanding "by millimeters each hour," forcing immediate action. Cost is visceral in the six-month timeline, but agency lacks deeper personal tradeoffs beyond professional duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete investigation: "reality rapidly adapting" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of patch catching sun implies adaptation, avoiding simplistic binaries while charging prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in technical observations ("anemometer," "wind speeds of zero and infinity"). One filter verb ("Maya had traced") slightly dulls immediacy but voice modulates effectively from protocol to visionary clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "plume spiral upward, bending at impossible angles" demonstrates high-density propulsion. "Hazy precision" avoids therapy-speak through concrete tablet/disorientation linkage in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes through investigator's procedural lens. Shipping containers warping like "steel flowers" synthesizes mundane setting with cosmic phenomenon in a non-obvious, emotionally specific way.</comment>
