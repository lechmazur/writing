<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Master Kenji's embodied grief manifests through bonsai pruning and lace decoding—no therapy-speak, only concrete micro-choices like tracing "the tide's return" knots while confronting his daughter's absence. His final decision to write emerges organically from the compass revelation, charged by the lace's hidden message about "unsaid words as anchors."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the compass needle fixes on "cerulean regret," crystallizing Kenji's emotional blindness with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through tidal rhythms and lace patterns, with the bell's impossible tolling reweighting remembrance as active reconciliation rather than passive waiting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ghost ship's compass and antique lace constrain choices—Kenji decodes grandmother's war-era messages to prune the juniper, while the compass's spinning needle forces confrontation with undelivered apologies. Final image of "cerulean in the throat hollow" charges closure by merging bodily specificity with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (bridging silence with Yuki) tightens when the compass stops pointing to the color of "every word he'd failed to say," transforming passive grief into active intent to write. Cost is visceral: his placid facade shatters as he finally sees his own emotional color, narrowing options from tides to tangible words.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lace patterns and tidal language rather than moralizing—"diffuse anger by diffusing light through tears" reweights apology as embodied action. Final image of "roots holding fast while leaves let go" offers non-literal resolution to severance, with the compass's cerulean hue crystallizing regret as a bridgeable space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kenji notices only what serves bonsai or memory ("shadows dance through lace patterns," "green smell of rain-washed moss"). Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—short clauses during the compass revelation ("The needle stopped spinning...") mirror his fractured composure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances meaning ("Each loop and knot contained instructions she'd encoded during the war" compresses backstory into present action). Final line’s "roots hold fast while leaves learn to let go" crystallizes theme through concrete horticulture, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "severance" trope through bonsai-as-metaphor: pruning branches becomes literalizing emotional diffusion. Fresh inflection in the compass’s cerulean hue—a color for unsaid words—grounds abstract regret in visceral specificity without derivative symbolism.</comment>
