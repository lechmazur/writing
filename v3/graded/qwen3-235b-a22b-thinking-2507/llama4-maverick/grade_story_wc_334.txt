<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("crisp nostalgia," "fierce determination") rather than embodied contradiction; no visible trade-off in the resolution despite stated stakes. The mushroom retrieval lacks micro-choices showing competing impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—uncertainty is declared but not embodied in the final image. The "weight of her task" remains metaphorical; no concrete price paid on the page for the resolve to recover memories.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity anchors the sunken orchard, but the setting never constrains action (e.g., knee-deep water doesn’t slow movement or alter tactics). Shipwrecks function as static scenery, not active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering memories) are declared but never escalate—no narrowing of options or deepening complication beyond initial uncertainty. The protagonist’s resolve lacks earned friction; no visible price paid for the journey’s commencement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory recovery is coherent but undermined by the final paragraph’s near-moralizing ("world... full of mystery and wonder"). Avoids overt sermonizing yet fails to deliver a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("morbidly beautiful perfume") and rhythmic control shine, but "crisp nostalgia" recurs as an abstract label rather than embodied sensation during peak tension, slightly diluting voice authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure beat suffers filter-verb stacking ("felt a sense of resolve," "knew that," "felt the weight") and overwritten cadence ("ready to face whatever lay ahead"). Dulls the final image’s propulsion despite otherwise strong lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh setting details (sunken orchard greenhouse) elevate a familiar memory-quest premise, but emotional complexity lacks bold risk—no meaningful transformation of the "stolen memories" trope through specific folklore mechanics or moral ambiguity.</comment>
