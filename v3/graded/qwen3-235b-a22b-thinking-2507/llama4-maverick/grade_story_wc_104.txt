<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chained aspect remains decorative; motivation ("plant resilience") is told not shown through conflicted choices. "Staggering grace" is label-only with no embodied contradiction under pressure. Critical flaw: no visible cost paid for vault access or distribution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost—liberator succeeds effortlessly with no sacrifice. "Chained" metaphor never operationalized; vault guards bypassed without consequence. Violates cost proof test: no sentence/image where price is felt at ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Carnival setting vividly described but static; piano keys don't constrain choices (decoding happens off-page). Sugar/smoke scent evokes memory but doesn't pressure tactics. Micro-setting fails 9+ gate: no object charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes declared ("impede forces") but never tested—guards pose no real threat, allies signal conveniently. Zero escalation: pressure never tightens or forces trade-offs. Arrow/vault resolution feels coincidental, not earned by agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme stated overtly in finale ("true freedom was not just absence of barriers..."), triggering -0.6 penalty for final-paragraph moralizing. "Resilience" remains abstract; no concrete emotional aftereffect beyond generic hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV stable but voice flattens under pressure: "heart swelled with purpose" uses therapy-speak over embodied perception. No character-specific perceptual signature; descriptions remain touristy ("faint scent of sugar").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Template cadence loops ("As they...", "With...") repeat 7×. "Staggering grace" appears twice as unearned label. Paraphrase loop: "row upon row of seeds... each one a testament" dilutes momentum in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "chained liberator" cliché, seed vault trope recycled from climate fiction. Carnival setting adds no fresh angle—feels like ornamental checklist. Transformation test fails: plot works unchanged with generic "warehouse".</comment>
