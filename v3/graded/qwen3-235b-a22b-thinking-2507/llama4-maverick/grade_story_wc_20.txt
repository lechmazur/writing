<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("luminous regret," "disillusioned") without embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure beyond picking up the coin. Final redemption feels unearned as no prior causality compels her shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (peace with transformed regret) with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—realization about "weight of names" occurs off-page between "weeks turned into months" with no on-scene pressure shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rain-washed foundry functions as micro-setting: rain "washes away residue" early and the coin charges the final image ("seemed to glow"), but environment never constrains choices or alters tactics during key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption via understanding names) remains abstract; no on-page escalation beyond temporal summary ("weeks turned into months"). Cost ("luminous regret") is stated but never viscerally felt through dramatized trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Thematic moralizing dominates the ending ("she had finally begun to redeem herself"), violating organic emergence. Kintsugi metaphor is elegantly integrated but "weight of names" remains vague abstraction without concrete cost reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's material/mystical duality) sustains voice, but "luminous regret" recurs as unearned label-speak, flattening emotional complexity under pressure in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density and lyrical flow marred by paraphrase loops ("the foundry became... alchemist's art was reborn") and repetitive "luminous regret" cadence in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kintsugi-alchemy synthesis feels fresh, but "weight of names" mysticism lacks specificity. Avoids derivative tropes yet plays safe with redemptive arc; no bold structural risks heighten stakes despite coherent vision.</comment>
