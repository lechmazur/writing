<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete contradiction; "tremor of certainty" repeats as abstract label without embodied cost. No visible trade-offs for being "aesthetically driven" despite high-stakes artistic breakthrough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolved boundaries), but "ban lifts" setup lacks tangible stakes payoff. Lens (Accumulative) holds, yet causal progression of artistic liberation feels unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen lake functions as micro-setting: bare feet on ice charges final image with physical risk. Cobalt atrium’s light-play mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, though quartz colonnade dominates sensory palette.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic transcendence) tightens through sensory accumulation, but "ban lifts" backstory implies stakes never materialize as concrete cost. Liberation lacks visible price beyond abstract "dissolved boundaries."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through quartz/light motifs, but final moralizing ("beauty and truth lay hidden") triggers -0.6 penalty. Artistic transformation resonates, yet "shatter complacent surfaces" feels like thematic echo in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz colonnade pulsed with gentle energy") shows Lyra’s artistic lens. No POV slippage, but rhythmic control falters in repetitive "tremor" phrases during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cripple climax: "tremor of certainty" repeats verbatim 3x in final third. Filter-verb stacks ("Lyra felt... Lyra felt...") dull immediacy; "lantern-moth hush" synonym churn triggers -0.7 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ice/art/mysticism avoids tropes, but "cloud-shadow poet" feels derivative. Bold structural risk (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes, yet lacks irreversible cost to anchor ingenuity.</comment>
