<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "gentle rebellion" motivation feels untested with no visible struggle against decay. Label-only emotions ("joy, sorrow, longing") without specific sensory degradation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works (sprout symbolizing rebirth amid ruins), but cost remains abstract—rebellion's price isn't concretely felt despite celestial alignment fading. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently through sensory build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid greenhouse decay anchors atmosphere, yet rust/corrosion never constrains Aria's actions (e.g., no struggle with broken tools). Final sprout charges theme but micro-setting fails to alter tactics during key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract; "gentle rebellion" isn't dramatized as active conflict with narrowing options. Celestial alignment creates urgency but no tangible cost—Aria succeeds effortlessly without sacrifice or trade-offs during pruning/cooking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through memory-infused cooking, but final paragraph's moralizing ("beauty that could be forged") triggers -0.8 penalty. Lacks ambiguity—decay/rebirth binary resolves too neatly without complex counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct taste-focused POV voice with lyrical rhythm, but diction drifts into abstraction ("profound connection") during climax. No stress-induced compression under celestial pressure—prose stays uniformly elevated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats: "synaptic plasticity" appears as jargon without integration, and final thematic echo ("beauty that could be forged") dulls closure. Strong sensory density elsewhere, but scaffold phrases ("testament to forgotten dreams") clutter momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-tasting chef with botanical decay, yet "knowledge fruit" trope feels derivative. Emotional specificity in cooking memories elevates it, but rebirth arc lacks bold risk—predictable resolution avoids meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
