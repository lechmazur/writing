<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied emotion ("velvet disquiet," children's joy seeping into patterns) but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; scribe's passivity during prophecy escalation undermines agency-driven motivation. Final endurance lacks visible cost on character state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (irreversible prophecy set in motion), anchored by dawn-lit garden holding its breath. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (thickening air, pulsing emotions), but foghorn silence as "harbinger" feels telegraphed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wax cylinder phonograph functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (tangible prophecy vessel), constraining archiving method. Skyscraper orchard remains postcard-esque; height offers no tactical constraint despite atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (archiving vs. unleashing prophecy) tightens through atmospheric deepening ("air thickening with anticipation"), with conceptual cost crystallized in silent foghorn. Scribe's agency passive during escalation—prophecy emerges accidentally without tactical adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of past shaping future emerges organically through field trip memory merging with present patterns; final dawn image ("some things forever changed") reweights premise without moralizing. Near-miss: "power of the past" phrasing borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (sensory focus on scents/sounds, dead languages as "soothing melody") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift: "palpable sense of anticipation" feels clinical amid lyrical voice during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("emotional patterns continued to pulse, a gentle reminder") with propulsion. Overwriting risk in "velvet disquiet" recurrence, but payoff in closure image prevents penalty. Final line resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oath scribe + wax cylinder archiving transforms "accidental prophecy" trope. Risk-taking in quiet Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but skyscraper orchard lacks transformative specificity (could be any garden).</comment>
