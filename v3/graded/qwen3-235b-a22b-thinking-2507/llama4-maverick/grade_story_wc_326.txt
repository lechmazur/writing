<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation lacks internal conflict; "death certificate error" backstory remains ornamental despite early mention. Heartbeats as mortality reminder is told not embodied, and no contradictory impulses surface during the ink ritual that would deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with cost in shard release, but causality breaks: ink patterns magically reveal ghost without struggle. Escalation fails—snow depth and radio static don't tighten options, violating Accumulative lens requirements for density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid but inert; opal observatory and snow function as mood wallpaper rather than constraints. Porcelain shard alone charges the closure image, though its inconsistent "glow" undermines physical logic when reweighted at dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: "defragment" action occurs off-page, and ink pouring lacks agency-driven pressure. Stakes remain abstract despite "midnight solace" framing; radio static clearing is coincidence, not earned narrowing of options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fetching wisdom from failure" emerges organically but risks thematic echo when stated outright. Final shard release resonates as non-literal answer, yet "universe's hidden truth" phrasing edges toward abstraction, diluting earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ink/snow imagery, but focalization wobbles: "heartbeats counted on" shifts from embodied detail to cosmic metaphor unprompted. Lyric compression works, yet "universe yield secrets" overreaches Akira's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Template cadence cripples momentum: "As [X], Akira felt [Y]" repeats 4x with filter-verb stacks. Closure beat suffers from "serene landscape that seemed to echo stillness"—synonym loop muddying the shard's final significance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Digital ghost trope feels derivative, but porcelain shard as transience metaphor gains freshness through tactile handling. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though "death certificate error" backstory lacks transformative specificity to avoid template pitfalls.</comment>
