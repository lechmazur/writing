<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "quietly deliberate" trait stated not tested under pressure. No visible cost for her research—trepidation feels abstract, not embodied. Interiority relies on labels ("insatiable curiosity") without micro-choices altering stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (shadows pausing) reconfigures meaning but cost remains conceptual, not legible on-page. Lens (Accumulative) holds, yet "felt cost" evaporates in final lines—no tangible forfeiture or altered option despite "trepidation" mention.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Observatory/isle described vividly but static; no constraint on choices (e.g., key could be studied anywhere). Clockwork key charges closure image yet fails 9+ gate—it doesn’t shape tactics mid-scene, only symbolizes retrospectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (shadows at noon) signaled early but escalation passive—research deepens without narrowing options or visible cost. Agency is observational; "understanding" forecloses nothing. Trepidation lacks concrete price, violating band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Lyra’s research, avoiding moralizing. Final image (shadows pausing) offers non-literal answer to central question. But "secrets of the universe" phrasing risks abstraction, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scholarly precision) with rhythmic control; "stars twinkled like diamonds" shows selective POV bias. Yet stress modulation falters—voice stays uniformly calm during high-pressure discovery, missing degradation under duress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("Lyra was a budding rune scholar... driven by insatiable curiosity" adjacent to "quietly deliberate" restatement) dull momentum. No figurative muddle, but template cadence ("Lyra believed... Lyra was convinced...") slightly impedes propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "spoons bending reality" with rune scholarship avoids trope clichés. But "shadows at noon" premise lacks transformative specificity—it could work unchanged in generic fantasy. Emotional truth anchored in Lyra’s wonder yet avoids bold risk.</comment>
