<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "aberrant mercy" defined via diagnostic label-speak in peak beat ("thoughts turned to the concept") triggering -0.5 penalty. Motivation clear but abstract ("cradle empathy") with no visible flaw compounding choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence/image shows price paid for renaming (e.g., physical exhaustion, social risk). Closure (Charged Poise attempt) lacks felt cost despite "weight of mission" telling. Lens (Hybrid) holds but cost invisible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid plaza description ("charred reminders," "cracked stone pavement") anchors setting early, but environment never constrains choices or charges final image. Mosaic functions decoratively rather than as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("reclaim plaza") remain abstract with no concrete pressure narrowing options. Renaming decision faces zero opposition or trade-off; coincidence (finding tessera) drives plot, not protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" stated as interior thesis ("thoughts turned to the concept") then moralized in finale ("power of compassion and determination"). Thematic echo in final paragraph triggers -0.7 penalty; concept never dramatized through choice with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice but lacks character-specific perceptual signature. "Warm coldness" creates register drift; all descriptions ("shattered sky," "glimmer of hope") use identical poetic diction regardless of emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mixed metaphor ("a coldness that was not quite cold") and cliché loops ("glimmer of hope," "beacon of warmth") in high-pressure beats. Template cadence ("She turned... She began... She stood") triggers -0.5 penalty for dulling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic hope trope executed competently but without fresh inflection. "Gentle radical" and "aberrant mercy" feel like prompt vocabulary rather than organic synthesis; emotional specificity lacks verifiable detail.</comment>
