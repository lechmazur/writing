<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Truthful nature stated but not embodied in choices; "cultivating psychological safety" is abstract label-speak that undermines interiority during pivotal cure experimentation. Flaw remains untested under pressure despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lacks legible cost; "sense of resolve" asserts rather than dramatizes trade-offs. Storm intensification fails to manifest tangible consequence for occluding honesty, violating cost proof test at ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orchard's "twisted trees" effectively mirror psyche during relic discovery, but micro-setting potential of glass eye (constraining choices) remains unrealized. Sensory details stay tourist-catalog generic beyond initial storm imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (balancing truthfulness with emotional safety) signaled early but never concretely tested; "experiment with cures" summarized without dramatized failure or cost. Tightening occurs solely through exposition, not protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" concept emerges organically but final paragraph moralizes ("testament to enduring power") instead of charging image. Emotional scars named without showing occlusion's lived cost, creating thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in truffle foraging details, but voice collapses into therapy-speak ("psychological safety," "emotional scars") during critical reflection beats. Compression works until cure experimentation flattens into abstract summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong opening rhythm dissolves into paraphrase loops during textbook discovery ("battered and bruised," "fractured state," "fractured grace"). Filter-verb stacks ("began to piece," "began to uncover") dull immediacy in high-pressure relic investigation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Empathy virus" premise feels derivative of recent pandemic allegories without fresh inflection. Risk in Accumulative/Textural lens partially redeemed by "fractured grace" synthesis, but orchard setting lacks specific verifiable detail to anchor universals.</comment>
