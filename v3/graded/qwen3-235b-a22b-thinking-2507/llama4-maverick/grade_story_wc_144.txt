<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Blindness presented as poetic trait without constraining tradeoffs; "pouring her soul" triggers diagnostic label penalty. No contradictory impulses shown during calibration—success arrives effortlessly with zero visible struggle or cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure fails Cost Proof Test: mist clearing is atmospheric but not character-based cost. Ship's departure feels coincidental (Situational lens ambiguity), resolving the problem it didn't create. Orientation passes but closure lacks legible pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (fountain's rainbow, drone's hum) but environment remains ornamental—mist clearing charges no final image cost. Micro-setting (water features) doesn't constrain choices; merely decorates the solution without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("finicky navigation") with no dramatized malfunction escalation. Ship timing adds coincidence but no narrowing of options; resolution lacks visible cost (band guardrail violation). Pressure dissolves into serenity without earned trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of "harmony" emerges but final paragraph states it literally ("symbol of her craft... bring harmony"), triggering Thematic Echo penalty. No complex ambiguity—struggle is absent, making resonance feel unearned and sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct poetic voice but uniform tics under pressure ("mist-coated," "beacon of tranquility"). Filter-verb stacks ("Emilia watched – not with her eyes, but with her entire being") dull immediacy during high-stakes calibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("calm demeanor was magnetic... creating serenity" then "mist began to clear") and template cadence ("As [X], Emilia [Y]") in closure beat. Final image's weak nominalizations ("a demonstration of Emilia's skill") obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blind artisan trope lacks fresh inflection; "mystical insight solves tech problem" follows predictable template. Emotional truth undermined by effortless success—no specific lived detail transforms the premise into memorable originality.</comment>
