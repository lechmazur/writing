<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Label-only interiority ("flawed beauty," "operatively gentle") lacks embodied contradiction; motivation ("price of redemption") remains abstract thematic echo rather than character-driven choice. Diagnostic label-speak in climax ("anchor ideals in practice") violates Q1 anti-pattern with no visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation debt: vague "ancient terrace" fails anchor test by 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost—delegates' hope is asserted, not earned through Elian's agency. Lens ambiguity (hybrid attempted but unresolved) undermines causality; celestial dance offers no pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Generic "ancient terrace" and celestial clichés lack sensory specificity or constraint. Setting functions as postcard backdrop—midsummer sun and stones never pressure choices or charge the final image. White-room syndrome persists despite repeated object mentions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("price of redemption") with no concrete test; delegates' conciliatory shift happens off-page without Elian's causal agency. Pressure never tightens—no option foreclosure or knowledge shift. Coincidence (celestial calm) resolves tension without felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</comment><question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "anchor ideals in practice" is stated outright in final paragraph, violating Q5 penalty guidance. Theme emerges from abstraction ("redemption," "peace") not particulate events; no earned resonance beyond prompt-like moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>POV leaks into omniscient ("delegates departed, their faces etched...") and authorial intrusion ("flawed beauty"). Syntactic monotony in opening cadence ("As [X], [Y] stood...") creates drumbeat rhythm. Register drift: "operatively gentle" clashes with negotiator's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops ("ritual significance" ×3, "price of redemption" ×3) and synonym churn in climax ("measure of peace, a sense of redemption"). Template cadence in final paragraph dulls closure image; overwriting with stacked modifiers ("sweet scent of blooming flowers") obscures causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Derivative premise: symbolic object (clipboard) in peace negotiations feels templated (cf. West Wing tropes). Transformation test fails—swap "ebony clipboard" for "silver watch" and story remains unchanged. No fresh inflection; "flawed beauty" is generic abstraction.</comment>
