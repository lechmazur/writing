<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("felt an inexplicable sense") replaces embodied emotion; "destitute philanthropist" trait remains ornamental with no tension between poverty and giving. Micro-choices absent—Aria merely receives the bottle without contradictory impulses. Final transformation lacks visceral cost beyond abstract realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands (Aria's crystallized understanding of cosmic connection), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. Prophecy resolution feels coincidental, violating Situational lens guardrails; old woman's appearance lacks causal buildup. Non-closure accumulation cap applies: two distinct issues (unearned prophecy + abstract cost) → -1.5 from base 8.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Volcanic black sand beach creates vivid atmosphere, yet setting functions as decorative backdrop rather than constraint—rumbling volcano exerts zero pressure on choices. Misses 9+ gate: environment fails to charge final image or narrow tactics. Sensory details (waves, sand texture) are selective but don't alter Aria's actions or the bottle exchange.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeking meaning) remains abstract; "whispering hush" never operationalizes as tangible opposition. Zero escalation—Aria encounters no resistance when taking the bottle, and the prophecy "fulfillment" incurs no visible cost. Band guardrail violated: no price paid that alters tactics or charges the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bottled light motif, but final paragraph commits Thematic Echo: "world was alive and pulsing" redundantly states the premise. Lacks non-literal resolution—transformation is told ("knew she would never see the world same way") rather than shown through reweighted image. Q4 weakness caps Q5 at 7.2 per cross-cap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice with character-particular noticing (e.g., "treasures for meager collection"), but filter-verbs dilute immediacy: "felt," "knew," "understand" recur 8x. Register drifts into abstraction ("texture of transformation") during peak moments. Perceptual signature lacks specificity—no philanthropist-tailored observations of the beach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "whispering hush" repeats identically 5x with no pattern payoff. Final third contains filter-verb stack ("felt a sense... felt a surge... felt herself drawn") triggering -0.5 penalty. Template cadence ("As she walked... As she reached...") dulls closure momentum; "ethereal glow" to "vibrancy" lacks textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Transforms bottled lightning trope via volcanic setting, but "orchestrating coincidences" feels derivative of spiritual awakening templates. Emotional specificity lacking—transformation manifests as abstract realization, not behavioral change. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: core premise matches manifest destiny narratives without fresh moral calculus (-0.7).</comment>
