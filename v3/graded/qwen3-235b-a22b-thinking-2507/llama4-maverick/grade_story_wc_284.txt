<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract despite burned skin imagery; "prudently daring" trait stated but not tested in action with visible trade-offs. No embodied conflict when choosing the path—fear and courage lack simultaneous contradiction in the pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works (mist clearing, walking together), but cost feels conceptual rather than visceral; "weight lifting" lacks concrete on-page manifestation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through mist/snow pattern, though escalation lacks tightening pressure before the self-meeting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist actively shapes action by revealing/hiding the path, and snow depth constrains the search—environment directly charges the closure image. Pillbox as micro-setting earns 9+ gate by reappearing in the final beat with symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding courage) lacks concrete escalation; the mist clearing functions as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Cost remains abstract despite strong setup—burned skin’s weight isn’t leveraged in the choice to follow the path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of mending through courage emerges organically, but "unused courage waits" resolves into near-tautology without reweighting prior struggle. Final pillbox image avoids moralizing yet lacks the conceptual repricing depth for higher bands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal fingers," "silver hush") persists under pressure, though stress degrades syntax insufficiently. Single-POV stability and rhythmic control elevate, but late repetition of "sense of peace" dulls closure impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("mist swirled around her" verbatim twice) and template cadence ("she felt... she felt") in closure beat trigger −0.5. Filter-verb stacks ("began to scan," "began to search") dull immediacy without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy genre with lyrical redemption, but "other self" trope lacks transformation through specific lived detail. Risk-taking in structure (metaphysical climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though resolution edges toward safety.</comment>
