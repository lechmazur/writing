<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation to "defy gravity of hopelessness" is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; internal conflict remains observational rather than active struggle. "Serious playfulness" is told, not embodied through micro-choices during the hopelessness crisis. No visible trade-offs when the mosaic note resolves her doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lyra's renewed purpose crystallizes options with felt cost (the "gravity of hopelessness" she carries forward). Accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory deepening. Cost proof is legible in the contrast between "hopelessness creeping in" and her "renewed energy" after the mosaic note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Blooming fortress" provides vivid atmosphere but fails the 9+ gate: setting details don't constrain choices or charge the final image. Lanterns and gardens function decoratively; the fire spinner's tool is observed but never interacts with Lyra's decisions. Strong sensory specificity without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcoming hopelessness) tightens through ambient awareness deepening, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options. The mosaic note resolves doubt too neatly without visible struggle or trade-off. Cost is emotional (lingering "gravity") but not concretely demonstrated in altered tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "stillness/spark" motif, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("trail of creativity... gentle glow of firework's final spark") resonantly reweights the mosaic note without stating a moral. Near-miss for 9+ band: conceptual cost of hopelessness isn't viscerally recharged in the ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Lyra's sensory filtering ("processing movement and color"), with rhythmic control in chants' evolution. No head-hopping; compression of time (dusk to night) taught early through concrete cues. Slight register drift in "ambient awareness" phrasing occasionally distances the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with minimal loops, though "ambient awareness" repetition (4x) and adjacent "began to chant/began to filter" create minor scaffold. Final line's "gentle glow of firework's final spark" achieves crystalline resonance. No figurative muddle, but "hush of starless sky" borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fireworks designer premise feels fresh through "ambient awareness" lens, but mosaic note trope lacks transformation. Emotional specificity in Lyra's creative process elevates it beyond generic inspiration stories. Misses 9+ band: the "spark" motif echoes familiar archetypes without distinctive reconfiguration.</comment>
