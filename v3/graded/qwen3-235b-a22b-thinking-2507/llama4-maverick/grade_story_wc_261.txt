<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Abstract "closure seeker" label lacks embodied contradiction; Elian's wound-reopening motivation remains told not shown through conflicted choices. No visible cost beyond physical exhaustion in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric deepening, but escalation lacks meaningful pressure shift. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost in "weight of quest settling," yet causal agency remains passive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tower's micro-setting (coffee rings, hourglass) charges final image effectively. However, luminescent plants and damp earth remain decorative rather than constraining Elian's digging choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("read stories in scars") stay abstract despite atmospheric tension. No tangible trade-offs or narrowing options; the "meteor hush" deepens texture but fails to crystallize stance with visible cost until final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through coffee-ring patterns and scar narratives. Final image ("tower as testament to displaced miracle") reweights meaning without moralizing, though "tissue of reality" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV voice has lyrical consistency but over-relies on abstract phrasing ("sense of closure wash over them"). Perceptual signature weakens under stress; "displaced miracle" disrupts Elian's plausible lexicon during high exertion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong opening cadence degrades into telling ("felt a strange sense of comfort") and redundant modifiers ("dull ache crept back"). "Frosted hourglass" recurrence lacks evolving specificity; "meteor hush" feels pasted rather than earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coffee-ring analysis with scar narratives avoids cliché, but "frosted hourglass" and "telepathic plants" lean on mystical tropes without transformative specificity. Risk in Accumulative structure isn't fully leveraged.</comment>
