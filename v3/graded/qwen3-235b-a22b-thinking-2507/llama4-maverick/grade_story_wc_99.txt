<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; "slow-spoken" trait unused in micro-choices. Regret diffuses passively without embodied struggle or visible trade-offs during lace weaving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds but cost remains abstract; "weight lifted" lacks concrete legibility. Orientation clear early, but closure (compass release) feels unearned without prior struggle escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid but decorative; compass/lace never constrain choices. "Cerulean regret" is label-heavy, missing micro-setting pressure that could charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("color of apologies") stay abstract; no tightening of options or visible trade-offs. Lace method resolves the problem it didn't create, violating pressure coherence under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("testament to the power of the natural world to heal") triggers -0.7 penalty. Conceptual repricing fails as "cerulean regret" resolves into tidy peace without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV slippage in "Kaito's story became part of the islet's history" breaks focalization. "Slow-spoken" trait isn't reflected in syntax, though rhythmic prose suits emotional texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("emotions untangle, like threads of lace") and therapy-speak ("cerulean regret") in peak beats dull immediacy. Final third's "memory remained" cameo lacks causal pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes bonsai/compass/lace tropes with emotional specificity, but resolution avoids bold risk—regret "lifts" without meaningful sacrifice, hedging the stakes.</comment>
