<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("sense the shape of intentions") triggers -0.4 penalty; motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses or embodied struggle under pressure, rendering epiphany unearned despite precise actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—no on-page sentence concretely shows price paid for understanding echoes, failing cost proof test despite accumulative lens holding for density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity (lavender sachets, velveteen gloom) anchors atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices; micro-setting potential of sovereign case/tapestry underutilized for tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite early signaling; escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening—discovery happens passively through "decoding," with no narrowing of options or tangible cost altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects, but final "journey begun" articulation veers toward thematic echo; capped at 7.2 due to Q4 ≤6.9 preventing higher resonance without earned escalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scent of aged dust, starlight glow) sustains voice, though high-pressure beats lack rhythmic compression; no head-hopping but diction remains uniformly poetic under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As the sun dipped...", "As they entered...", "As the night wore on") triggers -0.5 penalty; lyrical density falters in final third with abstract assertions like "journey was far from over".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Premise feels derivative (mystical object in isolated setting); specific details (cobalt silo, sovereign case) offer freshness but fail transformation test—swap cemetery for lighthouse, plot unchanged.</comment>
