<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "burnished sorrow" label borders on thematic echo; contradictory impulses under pressure lack visible tradeoffs during shard analysis despite poetic competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("truths forever lost to the void"), but cost legibility falters mid-beat; Accumulative lens holds via atmospheric deepening yet lacks one persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: stone carvings anchor spatiality, dust on shard enables discovery, and covered mirrors charge closure via ritual comfort—environment constrains choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (historical truth) tightens via storm pressure, but escalation relies on atmospheric shifts rather than protagonist agency; conceptual cost lands though visible price remains diffuse beyond emotional sorrow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard/reimagining motif, but final paragraph’s "power of imagination" explicit moralizing violates organic emergence; "beauty, sorrow, hope" triad drifts into balanced toggling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("labyrinthine passages," "river of fire" metaphors) modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, though late "burnished sorrow" repetition slightly dilutes rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with strategic telling, but adjacent synonym loops ("reimagine, recreate, rediscover") and template cadence ("as she...") in high-pressure beats trigger −0.4 artifact penalty in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological rigor and poetic mourning elevates trope; "visible time" conceit transformed through ritual (mirror covering) and sorrow-as-tool, though emotional specificity lacks bold risk-taking.</comment>
