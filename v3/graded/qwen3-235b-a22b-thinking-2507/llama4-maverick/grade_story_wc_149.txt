<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("lovingly venomous intent") stated but not embodied; ghost bride lacks contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Alchemist's passive reactions ("felt a surge") miss hierarchy-of-values tradeoffs during pivotal bead grasp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "mournful elation" crystallizing cost, but debt repayment causality remains abstract—no dramatized friction in the ghost bride's fading beyond atmospheric description.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Carved stone bead functions as micro-setting charging the final image, yet "winter-cracked fields" feels ornamental. Sensory detail leans visual; sandalwood/myrrh scent lacks integration into active choice-making.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (debt repayment) accumulate texturally but lack protagonist agency—alchemist is guided passively with no earned trade-offs. Pressure narrows options via the bead's activation, yet cost remains emotional rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through resonant bead symbolism, but "lovingly venomous intent" states the thesis outright, weakening subtext. Final image reweights legacy with cost, yet abstract declarations dilute earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV voice shines in concrete perceptual details ("sandalwood scent," "shiver down spine"), but abstract labels ("bittersweet mixture") fracture lexical consistency under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("resonant frequency she had unwittingly unlocked") and paraphrase loops ("ghostly presence"/"enduring presence") slightly dull momentum, though final line's "mournful elation" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" offers fresh emotional specificity, but debt-repayment framework relies on familiar tropes without bold structural risk. Alchemical context elevates, yet lacks a non-obvious angle on the ghostly guide archetype.</comment>
