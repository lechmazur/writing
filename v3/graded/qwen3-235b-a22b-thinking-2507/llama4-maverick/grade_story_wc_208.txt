<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("turbine-hum reverie," "perpetually learning") without embodied contradiction; no visible cost for her artistic drive beyond storm inconvenience. Final "gratitude" feels unearned without prior struggle against GPS failure's consequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: storm "subsides" conveniently, leaving Aria with "satisfaction" rather than Charged Poise with pressure. GPS failure setup isn't paid off—no tangible consequence for navigation error, violating cost proof test despite Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Archway and sea create vivid atmosphere but remain passive backdrop; no environmental constraint on Aria's choices (e.g., waves don't threaten her work). Lantern slide's physicality is handled well but doesn't alter tactics beyond inspiration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (unlocking slide's meaning) stay abstract; storm provides atmosphere but no escalating pressure—subsides without demanding adaptation. No trade-off or cost paid during creation (e.g., sacrificing materials/time), leaving escalation inert under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" concept remains thematic echo, not earned through action; final paragraph moralizes ("world full of hidden patterns") triggering Thematic Echo penalty. No resonant answer to central question—closure states insight rather than reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice consistently lyrical but lacks Aria's perceptual signature—overuse of abstract phrases ("scaffold complexity," "layered meanings") distances focalization. Prose modulates rhythm well during storm but flattens into thematic assertion at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive scaffolding ("perpetually learning" x2, "reimagine" variants) and synonym churn ("intricate, ephemeral creations"/"rich tapestry of meaning") dull momentum. Final paragraph's moralizing summary obscures closure image, triggering Text-Artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh driftwood sculptor premise undermined by derivative New Age tropes ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie"). No bold risk—avoids testing Aria's optimism with genuine failure, hedging into safe middle without specificity to ground universals.</comment>
