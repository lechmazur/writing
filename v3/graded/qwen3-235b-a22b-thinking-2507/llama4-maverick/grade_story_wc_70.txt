<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; toll keeper's "determination" and "sparkling eyes" feel generic. Woman serves as plot device without distinct voice or pressure. "Sometimes failures preserve wonder" reads as thematic echo rather than earned insight, triggering diagnostic label penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing fails cost proof test—the adaptation revelation alters nothing practically. Resolution relies on coincidence (workers' riddle) rather than protagonist agency. No visible price paid for the discovery despite thematic claims.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" glow and humming machinery create vivid texture, but setting never pressures choices. Tower/beehive described poetically yet functionally inert—no physical constraints during ascent or inspection. Lacquer box lacks micro-setting integration beyond symbolic return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("witness failure") remains externally defined with no tightening. Resolution handed via matchbox riddle without trade-offs; protagonist passive throughout. Stakes never materialize viscerally—blackout aftermath lacks tangible consequences for characters' actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in toll keeper's final line ("failures preserve wonder") directly states the thesis, violating organic emergence. "City's resilience" moralizing replaces earned resonance. Adaptation twist has conceptual potential but drowned in tell-don't-show abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice drifts between poetic ("nectar dusk glow") and clinical ("conceptual repricing"). Toll keeper's observations lack perceptual signature—"eyes lit up" generic. Dialogue functions as exposition ("drone beehive failure") with minimal subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy: "toll keeper's eyes met hers," "began to inspect." Template cadence in ascent sequence ("they worked," "they found"). Final paragraph's paraphrase loop: "catalyst for connection... preserve wonder" echoes earlier abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Drone beehive concept fresh but execution leans on eco-tech tropes. Emotional truth diluted by thematic echo—lacks specific city struggles beyond poetic gloss. Safe middle-ground hedging avoids bold risks (e.g., no physical cost for "adaptation" discovery).</comment>
