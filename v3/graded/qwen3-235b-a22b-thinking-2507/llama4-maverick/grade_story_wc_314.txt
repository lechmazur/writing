<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "touch of wonder" drives smooth progression without friction. Label-heavy emotion ("deep sense of connection") avoids embodied cost, violating 9+ gate for visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks cost: "sense of peace" forecloses no path. Charged Poise fails Accumulative lens test—orchard vibrancy intensifies without narrowing options or raising stakes, violating cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard and crystal constrain choice (melting test) and charge final image. "Kaleidoscopic waterfall" recurrence reweights closure, satisfying 9+ gate via micro-setting pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>No escalation: stakes remain abstract intellectual curiosity. Flame action (9E) alters no options—starlings respond positively without cost, violating Band guardrails for visible price charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through starling patterns and crystal activation, avoiding moralizing. But "harmony within reach" finale lacks ambiguity, reducing complexity; conceptual repricing diluted by static stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (alchemist's observational bias) sustains voice. Tension in rhythm during crystal test, but reflection-led mode exceeds BRR limits in final paragraph, muddying present frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("frozen dew crystal," "fragrant mist") but paraphrase loops ("sense of wonder"/"touch of wonder") and template cadence ("As she..., Elara...") dull high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and starling patterns avoids tropes, but emotional safety hedge ("change life forever") undermines risk. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies—core premise mirrors common "nature reveals harmony" templates.</comment>
