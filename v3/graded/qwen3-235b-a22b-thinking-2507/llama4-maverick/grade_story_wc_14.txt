<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction absent; "incandescent restraint" reads as therapy-speak label without embodied cost. No struggle with collecting textures despite stated "invented histories" complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: no legible price paid for texture collection beyond lamp fading. Earned Stasis potential undercut by lack of prior stakes—dawn's arrival isn't a foreclosed path but natural progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bonsai forest setting constrains choice via labyrinthine paths and dappled light affecting notepad work. Final image of "trail of textures" charges closure by making micro-setting essential to the invented histories theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("collect textures") with no escalation—lamp hum fading is passive observation, not protagonist-driven deepening. Dominant stake lacks tangible cost; "textures linger" implies no consequence for the stationer's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of "invented histories" emerges through texture collection but resolves into tidy abstraction ("kaleidoscope of sensations") without conceptual repricing. Final image recharges motifs but avoids meaningful ambiguity about historical invention's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "charting hum" and "refracting light" shows character-particular noticing. However, passive observations ("forest came alive") dilute POV confidence during peak texture-capturing moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "pencil moved with precision... pencil danced... pencil slowed" (lines 9, 13, 15). Filter-verb stack in "she was drawn to this time" dulls immediacy where momentum should accelerate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stationer-as-texture-archaeologist feels specific, but bonsai/fluorescent lamp juxtaposition leans on familiar "nature vs. technology" tropes without transformative stakes. Risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens coherence.</comment>
