<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "photosynthesize pain" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat. No visible struggle between "shyly unstoppable" trait and environment despite centuries of longing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost ("weight... begin to lift"), but escalation is static reflection-driven. Non-closure accumulation: two issues (no present-tense pressure, backstory overuse) → −1.5.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid bioluminescent fungi and shell imagery lack tactical constraint. "Reef-shadow joy" phrase tries but fails to integrate setting with final image; no object constrains choices per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform pain) never tested in scene; no reversal or deepening. Band guardrail failure: "weight... lift" is told, not shown with visible price charging final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Photosynthesize pain into beauty" is pseudo-profundity; thematic echo in final paragraph ("changed her life forever") triggers −0.6 penalty. Resonant final image but lacks non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("off-key wind") but academic register drift ("photosynthesize") in peak beats. Filter-verb stack in closure ("knew that she would continue") dulls immediacy despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Closure-dulling artifacts: therapy-speak label ("photosynthesize pain") and synonym churn in final paragraph. Template cadence ("as she...", "the poet...") in high-pressure beats disallows 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" and "reef-shadow joy" feel forced; core premise (artist transforms pain) is archetypal without transformation. Derivative Premise Guardrail −0.8 adjustment for lack of specific world logic.</comment>
