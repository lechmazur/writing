<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lyra's "reluctant metamorphosis" summarized with diagnostic labels ("strange sensation") rather than embodied micro-choices; contradictory impulses lack simultaneous scene action despite strong sensory grounding during ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure succeeds but cost lacks concrete legibility; "strange sensation" remains abstract rather than an undeniable image like the luminescent figure, failing cost proof test under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard's rare spices constrain ritual success and charge closure; scent motif evolves from Aria's arrival to spirit manifestation, making environment indispensable to the final image's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through ritual density but metamorphosis cost stays abstract; Lyra's agency drives escalation via spice-conjuring, yet visceral price remains undramatized despite "kaleidoscope" turmoil description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cosmic harmony reweighting death's boundaries, but "reluctant metamorphosis" labels concept prematurely; final wonder image avoids moralizing yet echoes prompt language slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice maintains consistent perceptual signature (scent/touch focus) with rhythmic control; stress moments lack syntactic compression that would heighten ritual pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Filter-verb stack ("Lyra felt...") in climax dulls immediacy; "kaleidoscope of colors" strains metaphor coherence during high-stakes transformation, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of beast-whispering with cosmic intimacy avoids clichés, though phoenix-rises timeframe feels derivative; emotional specificity in ritual's tactile details elevates premise beyond safety middle.</comment>
