<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but static; no interior conflict or contradictory impulses shown during pressure. "Sanely eccentric" remains label-only without tradeoffs affecting choices. Micro-choices absent as she merely traces diagrams.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—peace replaces stakes. Orientation failure: who/where/when unclear past 120 words, capping Q3 at 7.0. Accumulative lens holds but deepening doesn't narrow options or charge final image with tangible price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sandalwood, paper scent) but setting never constrains choices. Scientific poetry library functions as postcard backdrop; no micro-setting (e.g., tome, pencil) alters tactics despite frequent handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("stories dormant") remains abstract with no escalation. "Urgency" paragraph shows deepening but no protagonist agency driving pressure; patrons' departure doesn't tighten stakes. Zero visible cost paid for reawakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "analog memories" motif, but avoids complexity—no counter-readings or moral calculus. Final scarf image reweights meaning without stating morals, though epiphany ("place where stories lived") feels unearned by struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias (all details serve atmosphere, not librarian's priorities). "Sanely eccentric" phrasing bleeds into narrator voice; no modulation under pressure during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean grammar with strong textural specificity ("gnarled tree," "sandalwood tang"), but minor scaffold: filter verbs ("as if searching," "seemed to glow") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final line's "richer, more wondrous place" borders on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Science/art fusion feels familiar; hyperbolic geometry adds conceptual freshness but isn't transformed through character-specific choices. Safe execution avoids risk—no bold structural choices or moral ambiguity to elevate beyond competent synthesis.</comment>
