<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is absent; Aria claims "not ready" yet shows no struggle resisting stillness during her task. Motivation remains abstract ("capture beauty before oblivion") without embodied tradeoffs, weakening the closure's earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: aurora’s deepening saturation and emerald’s resonance create density escalation. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost—"sorrow" pang felt when facing oblivion—but orientation delay (grotto details past 120 words) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the emerald chip’s evolving light constrains Aria’s focus and charges the final image ("pulsed softly in darkness"). Sensory details (aurora’s "kaleidoscope," crystalline "hum") are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered through her mortuary-trained perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via textural accumulation ("world contracting to a single point"), but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Aria’s resistance to stillness feels passive; no visible cost alters her tactics during the task, weakening the "meaningful tightening" requirement for high-band scores.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through aurora/emerald interplay, but "threshold of stillness" remains abstract. Final image reweights it as "beacon of hope," yet avoids concrete cost—Aria’s "sorrow" isn’t tied to a loss, making the resonance feel unearned compared to the physical stakes of her task.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("polished the emerald chip... searching for hidden patterns"), but peak-beat syntax flattens ("Aria's fingers moved... Aria felt... Aria smiled"). Compression is purposeful, yet "threshold of stillness" repetitions dull rhythmic control during critical moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Template cadence runs ("Aria's hands moved... Aria's mind wandered...") trigger -0.6. Filter-verb stacks ("began to discern," "began to slow") obscure immediacy in high-pressure beats, but lyrical density ("radiant hush," "symphony of light") saves momentum until the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mortuary precision and auroral transcendence avoids cliché, yet "threshold of stillness" leans on familiar spiritual tropes. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off, but the concept lacks the specific, verifiable detail needed for 9.0 (e.g., no tangible cost from resisting stillness).</comment>
