<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; final choice lacks visible cost beyond tiredness. "Storm-born silence" tells rather than embodies emotional conflict. Micro-choices absent during pivotal pacing scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—final "exhausted but fulfilled" is telling, not showing. Lens (Accumulative) holds but density doesn't deepen meaningfully toward dawn. Orientation strong but payoff inert.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Brook setting ornamental; never pressures choices despite pacing scenes. Seed functions as micro-setting but static—it charges no decision. "Dappled shadows" vivid yet generic, failing to constrain tactics or reweight final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("safeguard innovation") never escalate—seed remains pure catalyst without complication. Pressure flatlines; "hush of possibility" intensifies mood but forecloses no path. Cost abstract, never dramatized in choice or consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Thematic echo in finale: "gratitude for unknown sender" states moral directly. Corpse flower’s irony (death-scented bloom) unused for conceptual repricing. "Symbol of mystery" reduces complexity to platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in brook/seed imagery, but academic diction ("orthogonal approaches") clashes with proprietor’s voice. Filter-verb stacks dilute immediacy ("she felt," "she believed") during high-pressure reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure-beat artifacts: synonym loops ("sparked chain of creativity... new wave of innovation"), overwriting in finale. Template cadence ("As she..., she...") clusters in pivotal dawn scene, dulling cost legibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escape room proprietor fresh, but emotional arc generic (confusion → inspiration). Corpse flower’s real grotesqueness ignored—missed chance to subvert "nocturnal haven" beauty. Risk-averse in moral resolution.</comment>
