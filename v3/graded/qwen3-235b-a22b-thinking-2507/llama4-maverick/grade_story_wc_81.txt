<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict absent; "dappled resolve" is unearned label-speak in peak beats triggering diagnostic penalty. Micro-choices lack pressure-driven tradeoffs, reducing stakes to passive observation rather than active struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("she had been changed"), but cost proof fails—no embodied image shows transformation, only abstract statements. Orientation perfect, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) weakens causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Library setting vividly anchored but static; ink stamp charges the final image yet never constrains choices during deciphering. Sensory details rich but lack pressure integration—waterlogged environment doesn’t impede or enable tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("trace honest origins") signaled early but never concretely tested; escalation is intellectual realization without visible cost until the end. Agency passive—hypothesis shift emerges from thought, not pressured choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through textual work but "reclaimed stillness" remains abstract echo, not embodied constraint. Final stamp image offers resonant closure, yet "dappled resolve" undermines non-literal weight with label-speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent introspective voice but filter-verb stacks ("Elara felt...") dull immediacy; perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias. No dialogue, yet internal rhythm lacks pressure-modulated cadence during deciphering climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (≥3 lines) trigger -0.5 penalty; template cadence ("As she...") and synonym churn ("reclaimed stillness"/"forgotten library") obscure momentum. Abstract labels replace embodied prose in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sunken library premise fresh but execution generic; "logical page indexer" trope lacks specific lived detail. Emotional truth diluted by therapy-speak, though ink stamp’s final reprise shows organic synthesis.</comment>
