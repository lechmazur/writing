<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("wondered if," "sensed") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation ("understand why houses feel alive") lacks concrete stakes or visible cost; epiphany feels unearned as a solitary walk with no resistance. "Hushed blaze" realization lacks tradeoffs, violating "flaws complicate choices" requirement. Diagnostic label-speak ("vibrate with otherworldly energy") triggers anti-pattern penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: final gratitude lacks legible price ("secrets revealed" is thematic echo, not earned consequence). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) collapses as sensory details don't constrain choices—ritual described via summary ("began to walk," "leaving objects") not dramatized action. No meaningful tightening; pressure evaporates when streetlights "flickered to life" without altering Eli's path. Missing causal link between shard and revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bay and shop establish vivid atmosphere ("sweet scent of blooming flowers," "soft lapping waves"), but setting functions as postcard backdrop without constraining choices. Micro-setting potential in orris root shard falters—it's observed but never handled concretely to alter tactics. Streetlights' "ethereal glow" creates tone but ignores spatial choreography (no impact on ritual execution). Strong sensory specificity capped by environmental passivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("understand why houses feel alive") remains abstractly declared with zero concrete testing—no obstacles, failures, or tactical shifts during ritual. Pressure never escalates: Eli walks, places objects, instantly achieves revelation without cost. Violates "stakes that remain abstract" and "static conflict" anti-patterns. Closure lacks tradeoff; "hushed blaze" epiphany requires no forfeiture, rendering stakes inert.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme ("houses as living entities") emerges through particulars but collapses via final moralizing ("gratitude for secrets revealed"). "Shard of hush" concept remains decorative jargon without earned resonance—no complexity or ambiguity in revelation. Violates "thematic echo" penalty (-0.6) with prompt-like final line. Fails Q5 9+ test as ending states rather than reweights the central question through image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV consistency wavers during ritual ("Eli felt the atmosphere shift" vs. omniscient "air vibrated"), diluting focalization. Prose has rhythmic control ("last wisps of winter's chill dissipated") but overuses lyrical abstraction ("beauty of the present moment palpable"). Avoids dialogue pitfalls but "daydreaming" streetlights break psychic distance. Perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; descriptions read as generic poetic filter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Loops proliferate: "quiet bay" repeated 3x in opening, "hush/hushed" iterations become mechanical. Final beat's "deep sense of gratitude" is therapy-speak label violating "embodied emotion" rule. Template cadence in ritual sequence ("As she... As the sun... As the streetlights...") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Strong opening line undermined by closure artifacts; "hushed blaze" metaphor feels forced in peak moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" concept recycles New Age tropes without fresh inflection—swap "bay" for "forest" and nothing changes. Emotional arc lacks specificity; revelation feels templated ("living, breathing entity" cliché). Derivative premise guardrail applies: houses-as-alive trope executed generically without moral calculus or world logic transformation. Avoids safety middle but fails authenticity test via mystical convenience.</comment>
