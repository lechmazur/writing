<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (truth/fabrication) shown via paper trails and dust-mote ritual, but reinvented history lacks on-page cost demonstration; micro-choice attaching final message earns endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with bittersweet cost ("beauty and pain of the past"), but "blooming withering" emotional shift lacks causal trigger; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dust motes function as micro-setting charging closure ("swirling... fading light"), yet bookshop attic remains atmospheric backdrop without constraining choices like pigeon handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (secrecy/connection) deepen through dust-mote ritual, but pressure lacks visible price paid; Emilia's peace feels unearned without tactical trade-off beyond abstract emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through paper trails/lost songs without moralizing; final image ("dust motes dance") reweights past as lived complexity, though "blooming withering" slightly abstracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (paper scent/dust motes) with rhythmic control; no head-hopping, but "bittersweet sensation" risks over-abstracted interiority in peak moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with vivid imagery, but "blooming withering" and dual "musty scent" repetitions slightly dilute momentum; final line ("dust motes dance") crystallizes closure cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pigeon courier/reinvented history via dust-mote ritual; emotional specificity avoids tropes, though Mars meteorite leans decorative without deeper integration.</comment>
