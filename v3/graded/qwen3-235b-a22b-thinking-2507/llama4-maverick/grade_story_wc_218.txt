<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; "brazen calm" remains untested under mortality pressure. Motivation clear but lacks visible struggle with flaws during copper-wire work. Embodied emotion strong yet contradictory impulses absent in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation flawless within 120 words. Closure (Charged Poise: "copper wire sang") carries conceptual cost of mortality. But "six months" timeframe fails to tighten present-tense tactics; escalation lacks density shift despite Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Temple orchard's sensory details vivid but decorative; living stone pillars never constrain choices. Copper wire charges final image yet micro-setting doesn't alter earlier tactics. Misses 9+ gate requiring environment to shape decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy before death) signaled early but pressure doesn't escalate meaningfully. Mortality decline stated not dramatized through choices; no on-page reversal where timeframe narrows options. Stakes remain abstract despite concrete setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through orchard transformation without moralizing. Final image reweights "brazen calm" into legacy song, avoiding stated morals. But recurring copper wire motif lacks conceptual repricing at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct botanical perceptual signature shines ("symphony of sounds they had created"). Rhythmic control modulates with emotional intensity. "Brazen calm" label repeats verbatim without deepening, causing slight register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Scaffold loops: "gently systematic approach" repeated verbatim. Synonym churn in final paragraph ("flourish"/"thrive"/"vibrant"). No figurative muddle, but momentum drag in reflection blocks impedes 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical science and architectural mysticism through copper wire method. Emotional truth elevates trope but "dying mentor" proximity lacks non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation insufficient for 9+ band.</comment>
