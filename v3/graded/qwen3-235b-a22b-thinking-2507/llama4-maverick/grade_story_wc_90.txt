<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacifist motivation clear but internal conflict lacks embodied struggle; no micro-choices during shadow work despite claimed peril. Dissolution feels unearned as contradictions ("undaunted" vs "darkest aspects") remain summary, not simultaneous action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Aurora's dissolution, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—the "perilous journey" claim contradicts smooth stitching progression. Cost (her fading) legible yet insufficiently earned by prior pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear constrains choice (happiness affecting weight) and charges final image; storage bay's aged paper scent mirrors emotional decay. Micro-setting (photographs as tools) actively shapes tactics during stitching climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking dimension) signaled early, but "perilous" shadow work lacks dramatized opposition—no narrowing of options or trade-offs. Cost (Aurora's dissolution) is conceptual but feels unearned due to absent escalation pressure during stitching.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of shadow work emerges through stitching actions, not moralizing. Final image (Tear still, legacy "illuminating path") reweights "repressed thoughts" as transformative without stating moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears" as sensory anchor) modulates under pressure. Consistent lyric compression taught early pays off in closure, though "ghostly resolve" repetition risks template cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exquisite rhythm ("glided," "stitch together fragments") with zero loops, but "ghostly resolve" repetition in climax paragraph triggers −0.3 artifact penalty. No figurative muddle; final line recharges Tear motif with concrete propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism/shadow work via tactile stitching, but "recycled spaceship" trope lacks specific transformation. Emotional truth in dissolution resonates, yet avoids bold risk-taking on the claimed "peril" of shadow work.</comment>
