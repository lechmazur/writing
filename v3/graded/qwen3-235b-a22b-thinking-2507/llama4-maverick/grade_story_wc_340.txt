<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("affectionate detachment," "deep connection") without embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost. Micro-choice of unfolding the diary page shows value hierarchy but emotional progression remains tidy and untested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (spire reconfigured as "sanctuary") lands with conceptual cost, but the price isn't legible on-page—the "sense of peace" contradicts expected anguish. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, yet escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; discoveries happen to Elara, not through her choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire renders vivid atmosphere through frost/light motifs, but fails the 9+ gate: setting never pressures choices (she moves freely) or constrains tactics. Goggles function as micro-setting charging the final image ("seemed to glow"), yet the shrine chamber appears deus ex machina without causal setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding love's duality) is signaled early, but escalation remains passive—Elara reacts to diary revelations rather than driving pressure. Conceptual cost (changed worldview) lacks on-page legibility; "sense of peace" obscures the required anguish trade-off, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through diary excerpts and spire reframing, avoiding direct moralizing. Yet final paragraph's "love and loss were intertwined" borders on thematic echo, and the resolution lacks meaningful ambiguity—Elara's neat "peace" oversimplifies the promised anguish/joy tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in ice/light observations ("sunlight danced through ice crystals"), with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor abstraction ("poignant beauty") and label reliance ("deep sorrow") prevent higher score, but voice remains consistent and compression serves accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("frost-etched walls," "ethereal light") with clean grammar, but paraphrase loops ("uncovered secrets"/"uncovering secrets") and template cadence ("Elara felt... Elara's motivation...") dull momentum. Final paragraph's scaffold ("ready to continue... less isolated") prevents 8.0+ despite otherwise vivid prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of icebound spire and airship goggles creates memorable texture, but core premise (diary revealing past love) remains derivative. Emotional specificity in "joy beneath anguish" elevates it, yet transformation test fails—swap "spire" for "castle" and logic holds, lacking irreplaceable stakes.</comment>
