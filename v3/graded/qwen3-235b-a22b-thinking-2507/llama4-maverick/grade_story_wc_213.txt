<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; "credible curiosity" remains abstract label without visible trade-offs or cost during bell switch. Final endurance lacks earned friction from flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with Charged Poise closure, but cost remains conceptual ("beauty in quiet moments") without on-page legibility. Wind's pattern revelation lacks felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Windblown sanctuary functions as micro-setting: bell constrains choices (repair, ringing patterns) and charges final image. Glue-drying detail evolves causally with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (listening vs. noise) lacks escalation; bell switch occurs without resistance or narrowing options. Stakes remain abstract despite lyrical resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically until final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("reminder that...") triggers -0.5 penalty for thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (wind-as-symphony) but POV breaches occur with off-page "people of the sanctuary" reverence. Filter verbs dilute immediacy in key beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Ember lived... took... would pause") and synonym churn ("solstice hush"/"expectant hush") in final third incur -0.7 artifact penalty. Final line resonates despite loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound/climate science with lyrical voice, but "bell as mindfulness metaphor" lacks non-obvious angle. Emotional specificity elevates trope without full transformation.</comment>
