<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No interior contradiction; "gently thorough" stated but never tested under pressure. Preservation motivation lacks competing impulses or cost—no sacrifice made for the locket photo beyond abstract "satisfaction."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Orientation test failed: "blooming jetty" and archivist's role unclear past 120 words. Closure lacks legible cost—no on-page sacrifice for "haunted euphoria," violating Q2 cost proof test. Lens (Accumulative) holds but closure inert.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Jetty’s flowers bloom "vibrantly" but never constrain choices or charge closure. Sensory details vivid yet ornamental; no constraint on tactics (e.g., locket handling unaffected by environment). Capped at 7.0 per orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("preserve small moments") remain abstract—no narrowing of options or tangible cost. "Regenerated covenant" deepens theme but never alters tactics; pressure flattens into nostalgia without escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph: "enduring power of human connection" states moral explicitly. "Haunted euphoria" repeated as prompt-like thesis, triggering -0.7 penalty; no resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV consistent but "haunted euphoria" repetition dilutes voice. Perceptual signature ("walnut-ink," "steeped in nostalgia") distinctive yet overwrought. Capped at 7.8 per orientation debt cross-cap.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Loops abound: "haunted euphoria" (4x), "weight of small moments" (3x). Final paragraph’s "testament to enduring power" uses abstract thematic echo, dulling closure. Density muddle in peak beats lowers propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Derivative premise: archivist + locket photo cliché. "Regenerated covenant" lacks fresh inflection—merely repackages love/preservation tropes without transformation. No bold risk-taking beyond ornamental lyricism.</comment>
