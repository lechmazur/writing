<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation for "mathematics of mercy" appears abruptly without prior character-rooted causality; trauma responses guide action but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal restraint struggle. Diagnostic label "trauma responses" triggers -0.5 deduction mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (grasping truth in clearing) has visible cost (tears, lifted penance) but lens shift feels unmotivated; "mathematics of mercy" emerges deus ex machina without Accumulative groundwork. Ambiguous escalation under chosen lens violates high-band gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest creates vivid atmosphere but fails micro-setting test: no environmental constraint on choices (e.g., no navigation challenges altering tactics). Body-as-setting (restraint stiffness) lacks causal pressure despite early anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trauma confrontation) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; forest "responding" feels coincidental not earned. No visible price paid during walk (stiffness mentioned but unused), violating cost legibility for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Mathematics of mercy" functions as Thematic Echo—prompt-like language stated verbatim by Elara and resolving conflict. Explicit thematic statement in final paragraph ("I remember") triggers -0.7 deduction, undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV consistency falters under stress: clinical terms ("proprioceptively enhanced") clash with poetic abstractions ("displaced rooted-ness"). Filter-verb stacks ("her eyes snapped open, and she was met") dull immediacy during high-pressure restraint struggle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops ("memories came flooding back... recalled the pain") and template cadence ("She remembered... recalled...") in trauma beat. Filter-verb cluster in climax ("Elara felt... knew... continued") triggers -0.5 closure-beat penalty, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Trauma-recovery trope lacks fresh synthesis; "ultraviolet penance" and "mathematics of mercy" feel forced poetic devices. Derivative premise guardrail applies (-0.8) as emotional arc matches standard redemption templates without transformation.</comment>
