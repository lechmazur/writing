<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on label-heavy traits ("infinitely patient") without contradictory impulses; "fulgurite glass" reflection lacks micro-choice impact on decoding. No visible struggle during fog thickening undercuts embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: decoded knots yield only "satisfaction" and "gratitude" with no on-page forfeiture, endurance cost, or altered tactics. Accumulative lens holds but Earned Stasis lacks legible price despite fog pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Golden dock setting excels in sensory specificity (salt scent, foghorn echoes) but never constrains choices; micro-setting object (rope) charges final image yet environment remains atmospheric backdrop without tactical influence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve ancient methods") stays abstract; fog/thickening pressure lacks causal escalation. No trade-off or narrowed options during decoding—success feels inevitable without earned cost or protagonist agency in tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of preservation emerges through rope/knots but resolves into tidy satisfaction ("did her part") without complexity. Final "secrets waiting to be uncovered" image avoids moralizing yet lacks conceptual cost to reweight prior material meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in oceanic details but converges into generic lyricism during climax ("world slowed down"). Consistent Accumulative lens yet rhythmic control falters with repetitive "She felt..." phrasing in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("glassy texture," "mournful tone") but template cadence emerges in closure ("She felt... She felt..."). Zero figurative muddle yet minor synonym loops ("soothing sounds"/"ocean's hush") dull final propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed collecting/knot decoding feels organic yet avoids risk—no bold choices transform stakes. Emotional truth in preservation motive but hedged by safe, cyclical resolution lacking irreversible consequence.</comment>
