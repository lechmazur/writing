<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "borrowed personalities" stated but not shown affecting micro-choices under pressure. Emotions remain abstract labels ("thrill of anticipation") without embodied conflict during the critical star-vanishing sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost remains atmospheric rather than character-specific. Vanishing stars create pressure yet fail to manifest tangible forfeiture; the stakes never concretely narrow Echo's options beyond vague "urgency."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Topaz workshop's tools actively constrain choices: letterpress mechanics and Halo fragment placement drive the climax. Luminescent orbs and musty metal type charge the final image with tactile specificity, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract ("mathematics of emotion") without visceral testing. The vanishing stars tighten time pressure but never force a trade-off; Echo's actions lack visible tactical shifts as options narrow, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>Theme emerges through concrete mechanics (letterpress ambiguity inducing "lucid turbulence") rather than moralizing. Final image of "whisper of words" resonates non-literally with transposed empathy, avoiding thematic echo despite late conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: technical precision ("intricate patterns of text that shimmered") modulates into poetic urgency ("swirling vortex of meaning"). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure without sacrificing legibility or voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("eyes gleamed") and passive constructions ("air seemed to thicken") dull key beats. Overwriting in climax ("kaleidoscope of emotions that seemed to shift and writhe") obscures the pivotal moment despite otherwise vivid propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress craftsmanship with theoretical empathy creates authentic novelty. Risk-taking in merging tactile printing with conceptual physics feels inevitable through Echo's obsessive specificity, avoiding derivative sci-fi tropes.</comment>
