<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; donor heart backstory remains decorative rather than driving present choices. Final realization feels unearned without visible struggle or cost, violating Earned Stasis requirements for Accumulative lens. "Insatiable curiosity" tells rather than shows internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but fails cost proof test—no exact moment where conceptual price becomes legible. Sunset observation passively happens to protagonist rather than arising from agency, violating Accumulative escalation requirement for density increase with cost. Lens ambiguity at midpoint weakens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tea house and morpho wing described with lush sensory detail but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choices. "Valley-mist wonder" tone remains decorative; micro-setting (wing) doesn't charge final image despite recurrence. Misses 9+ gate by lacking environmental constraint on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding human magnetism) signaled early but pressure never escalates—sunset occurs externally without protagonist-driven tightening. Stakes remain abstract ("secrets revealing themselves") with no visible price paid. Violates Band Guardrail: no trade-off forecloses paths despite Accumulative lens requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic Echo in final paragraph destroys resonance: "Kaito realized that some individuals..." states moral outright. Conceptual repricing attempt collapses into sermonizing, violating organic emergence principle. Direct statement ("connected to intricate patterns") replaces earned subtext, triggering -0.7 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature as dye master shines in color observations but lacks modulation under pressure—contemplative tone stays static throughout. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "realized," "understood") dull immediacy during pivotal moments. No psychic distance shifts despite rising contemplation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwriting muddles peak beats: "quietly explosive aroma," "valley-mist wonder" create register drift. Template cadence ("As he [verb]...") in opening violates sentence-variation rule. Filter-verb clusters in closure beat (-0.5 penalty) obscure conceptual cost, disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Magnetize stories" premise feels derivative of common metaphors; transformation test fails as swapping dye master for poet wouldn't alter arc. Avoids risk by staying safely abstract—no bold choices heighten stakes. Proximity check fails with echoes of standard "light refraction = human connection" tropes.</comment>
