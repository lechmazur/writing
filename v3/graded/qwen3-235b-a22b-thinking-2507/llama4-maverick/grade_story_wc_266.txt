<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete embodiment; "unused courage" remains abstract despite star-stamp motif. No micro-choices under pressure—travelers' resolve emerges passively ("felt a sense of resolve settle"). Eira's "gentle persistence" stated but untested in pivotal moments like darkness intensifying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "trepidation and anticipation" at the shore, but cost remains conceptual ("unknown challenges") not embodied. Orientation Test penalty: vague "veiled ridgeway" setting lacks spatial anchors by 120 words, capping score. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through twilight-to-dawn cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("shoreline lullaby," "mist-shrouded landscape") lack causal pressure—setting never constrains choices. Veiled ridgeway described lyrically but functions as backdrop, not active constraint. Orientation debt caps score per Q2 penalty; micro-setting (ticket punch) charges closure but too late for full integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("unused courage," "trials to come") stay abstract; no on-page test narrows options. Escalation via "darkness taking life" deepens atmosphere but lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Cost feels intellectual ("trepidation") not visceral—no forfeiture or tactical shift alters journey mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shoreline lullaby motif recharges at closure ("echoed through their minds"), answering "where unused courage waits" through embodied transition, not moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo despite abstract premise; final image ("path into uncharted world") reweights courage as active pursuit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct Accumulative/Textural lens holds with rhythmic cadence ("The [adjective] [noun]...") modulating pressure. But POV leaks into collective traveler thoughts ("they felt resolve settle") without individual access. No dialogue present; perceptual signature strong in sensory selection but template phrasing dulls peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic control falters with repetitive cadence ("The [adjective] [noun] [verb]...") in 7/10 opening lines, creating drumbeat monotony. Overwriting in "otherworldly energy," "expectant hush" dilutes momentum. Final-third artifact ("mist that had veiled...") uses identical structure to opening, disallowing 9+ globally per rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes archetypal journey with fresh specificity: "ticket punch star stamp" as commitment ritual avoids cliché. Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens pays off through shoreline lullaby motif. Derivative premise ("courage quest") redeemed by tactile details like damp-earth footsteps altering perception under stress.</comment>
