<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels like "mindfully scattered" without embodied contradiction; epiphany feels unearned as hesitation stems solely from vendor creed, not internal conflict. No visible flaw driving mistakes undermines credibility of her sudden clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (preserving bottle) holds under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility falters—restraint lacks felt consequence beyond "renewed determination." Orientation anchors by line 3, yet the "quantifying absence" method never concretely alters tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Glass orchard’s sensory richness anchors atmosphere, but setting remains passive backdrop; bottled moonlight functions as micro-setting yet fails to constrain choices beyond initial hesitation. Final image echoes setting without causal pressure reshaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding "where stories begin") remains abstractly declared; pressure tightens only once via hesitation, but cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. "Glimmering parole" complicates without testing commitment, leaving stakes unmaterialized in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of embedded narratives emerges organically early, but final paragraph moralizes ("found her true place"), triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Wisdom feels unearned as insight arises from sudden clarity, not struggle against concrete obstacles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with character-specific perceptual bias (vendor noticing "clean slate" objects), but template cadence in climax ("As she...") dilutes pressure. No dialogue, yet internal rhythm modulates effectively from calm to wonder under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose flows with strong textural specificity ("refracting soft, diffused light"), but synonym loops weaken key beats: "mindfully scattered" repeats without deepening. Filter-verbs ("felt an unexpected sense") slightly blunt immediacy, though no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Glass orchard" offers fresh imagery, but "glimmering parole" feels like generic mystical jargon. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.7) as swapping "bottled moonlight" for any magical object wouldn’t alter the emotional arc’s logic.</comment>
