<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but lacks contradictory impulses; "palpable weight" grounds grief yet final choice lacks visible trade-off. Micro-choices (selecting wood) don't reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "rust-hued peace" crystallizing options, but cost remains abstract—"manageable" pain lacks concrete legibility. Accumulative lens holds though "here and gone" concept isn't tested through action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ash wood grain and rain-beaded skylight constrain perception (sensory narrowing during grief), charging final image. "Rust-hued peace" elevates tool-as-setting beyond decorum by embodying emotional shift through color/texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing grief) tightens via carving ritual, but escalation lacks visible cost—pain becoming "manageable" feels unearned. Agency is present yet stakes remain internalized without tangible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash wood's transformation ("raw material" to artifact), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "here and gone" as contained loss, though "harvest lessons" risks slight thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via wood grain shifts and rain sounds, but "hauntingly practical" introduces therapy-speak register drift. Consistent psychic distance though emotional progression leans slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops with strong propulsion, but "hauntingly practical" triggers Patterned-artifact penalty. "Palpable weight" and "rust-hued" avoid cliché yet final "contain" phrasing slightly overwrites emotional precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through craft-specific details (ash wood grain, carving sounds), but emotional arc avoids bold risks. "Rust-hued peace" offers fresh inflection though premise remains familiar.</comment>
