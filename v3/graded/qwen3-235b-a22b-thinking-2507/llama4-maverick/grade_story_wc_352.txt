<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("prism-minded," "latent blaze") without contradictory impulses; final choice lacks visible cost as discovery yields pure purpose. Over-tidy emotional progression avoids irrational struggle with "seeds of vigilance" treated as given rather than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) has conceptual cost ("weight of discovery") but legibility fails—"responsibility" remains vague without specific forfeiture. Non-closure accumulation: two distinct issues (cost abstraction + gravity inversion underutilized as mere plot device) cap score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("parchment crackled," "scent of damp earth") lack constraint—grotto navigation is effortless, manuscript/doodle never alters tactics. Micro-setting fails 9+ gate: no environment/tool meaningfully charges final image or shapes choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes clear but escalation lacks protagonist agency—gravity inversion (coincidence) enables success rather than her choices. Zero resistance in grotto; "intense urge" isn't conflicted. Cost ("weight of responsibility") remains abstract, failing visceral legibility required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</comment><question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes ("responsibility that came with knowledge"), triggering -0.7 penalty for thematic echo. "Seeds of vigilance" treated as literal object rather than reweighted concept, replacing earned resonance with stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("clandestinely luminous") but tense shifts ("breathes deeply" mid-past narrative) disrupt consistency. Under stress, voice remains uniformly poetic without compression—no syntactic shift reflecting urgency during inversion climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure beat contains paraphrase loop ("secrets to uncover/seeds to nurture/journey far from over") and template cadence ("As she [verb]..."). Figurative muddle: "threshold effects" overused as explanation without concrete manifestation, dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tropes (magical manuscript, inverted gravity) feel derivative—replace "grotto" with "library vault" and plot works unchanged. Emotional truth generic ("sense of purpose"); no fresh inflection transforming vigilance beyond metaphor-to-literal pivot.</comment>
