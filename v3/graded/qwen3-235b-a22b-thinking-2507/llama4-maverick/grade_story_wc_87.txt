<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "merrily melancholic" holds, but "backlash of regrets" is diagnostic label-speak during peak crisis (para 4), weakening embodied emotion. Micro-choices like clutching the compass show value hierarchy, yet divorce backstory remains abstracted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost: "backlash of regrets would always be there" forecloses denial while accepting tools to navigate. Accumulative lens holds, but the "flickering flame" metaphor slightly obscures the felt cost's immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains navigation tactics and charges the final image ("familiar rhythm in his mind"). Coastal details evolve causally from "cruel reminder" to "path forward," avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Jack's deepening realization as he paddles, with the compass's recontextualization narrowing options. Cost is legible in "regrets would always be there," though the internal conflict lacks a concrete tactical loss beyond emotional endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the compass/poles contrast; final image reweights "broken" as strength without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, though "gravitate toward purpose" edges toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "merrily melancholic" observations ("candle flame in the wind," "golden glow over water") modulates with emotional shifts. Rhythmic control mirrors paddling cadence, with no head-hopping in this single-POV piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops in "felt calm... felt resolve... felt peace" dull momentum in high-pressure beats. Otherwise strong density, but "flickering flame of faith" metaphor slightly muddles the closure image's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation metaphor with emotional collapse avoids divorce clichés. Risk-taking in using mundane utility poles as symbolic anchors pays off through specific causal pressure on tactics and closure.</comment>
