<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to become visible" remains abstract without concrete opposition; "kindly methodical" is label-only without contradictory impulses or embodied cost during caching. Interiority relies on sensory description rather than character-particular emotional contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with the whispered rumor of hidden treasures, but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient density escalation—the tape reel discovery doesn't measurably alter tactics or deepen the visibility struggle. Cost of perpetual invisibility feels implied rather than legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Library setting excels with specific, tactile details (pipe chases, ferromagnetic tape, emergency generators) that feel lived-in, but fails the 9+ gate—environment doesn't constrain choices (dweller moves freely) or charge the final image beyond atmospheric mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming visible) is declared but never tested; no meaningful escalation occurs as the dweller faces zero opposition from patrons. The outage's "flickering lights" create urgency without tightening tactics or forcing a trade-off under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of visibility/memory resonates through particulars, but final lines verge on thematic echo ("even in darkest corners, there was always hope") risking sentimentality. Avoids moralizing yet lacks the non-literal reweighting required for 8.5+ as the closure image doesn't transform prior meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent poetic texture with dweller-specific sensory bias (noting dust, tool sounds), but "sapphire hush" repetition feels mannered. No dialogue present; perceptual signature stays coherent though stress compression under outage lacks diction shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong opening lines anchor voice, but paraphrase loops ("soft clinking... soothing melody"; "whispered rumor... myth") and stock lyricism ("sapphire hush" x2) reduce density. Final image suffers from "beacon in the sapphire hush" register drift into abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden guardian" trope through library-specific ecology (pipe chases, ferromagnetic tape), but emotional arc feels familiar. Freshness in sensory memory device is undercut by predictable hope motif; specificity avoids genericity yet lacks bold risk-taking.</comment>
