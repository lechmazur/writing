<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("nurture integrity in solitude") in peak beats triggers -0.5 deduction; no contradictory impulses shown during threat assessment, undermining motivation. Final choice lacks visible cost or earned trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "newfound purpose" shows determination but no legible on-page cost (e.g., sacrificed safety, altered state). Accumulative lens holds, but Earned Stasis lacks visible consequence for the "rogue quarantine zone" stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor setting early, but courtyard remains static postcard scenery. Micro-setting (message tube) doesn't constrain choices or charge final image—stars "shining brightly" offer no reconfiguration of prior tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety) signaled early, but escalation falters: "being watched" threat dissipates with "deep breath," no narrowing of options. Cost remains abstract ("be careful") without tangible forfeiture or altered tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("uncover the truth, no matter the cost") states thesis outright, triggering -0.6 penalty. Laboratory reveal feels generic, failing to offer resonant, non-literal answer to central question through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elevated diction ("progressing laterally," "intuit") breaches storm recorder's plausible lexicon under stress. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she couldn't shake") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats, weakening perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Template cadence runs ("she felt... she was left... she knew") in paragraph 7 and filter-verb clusters in closure beat trigger -0.5 cap. Mixed metaphor ("tranquility wrapped like a shroud") muddles final image’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Derivative premise (cryptic message → hidden lab) lacks transformation—swap "storm recorder" for "journalist" and logic holds unchanged. Emotional progression is tidy (curiosity → fear → determination) without irrationality or fresh inflection.</comment>
