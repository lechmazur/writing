<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("clean slate seeker," "dirty past") dominates interiority without embodied contradiction; "jaded wonder" is unearned abstraction. Micro-choices absent under pressure—baseball discovery lacks tactical shift despite stated stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure under Accumulative lens: mist clearing crystallizes options with visible cost (past weight lifting). But lens ambiguity early ("labyrinth" metaphor introduced mid-scene) nearly triggers cap; cost proof ("weight lifting") feels abstract, not concrete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting: its glow guides Lena’s epiphany about dim light = empathy. But sensory detail leans visual-heavy; "ethereal/otherworldly" clichés dilute specificity. Final image charged by lake’s pulse, yet tool (baseball) doesn’t constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("kindle empathy") signaled early but remain abstract; escalation via mist clearing feels coincidental, not driven by Lena’s agency. No tangible cost paid—emotional "weight lifting" lacks physical or relational consequence to tighten the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme collapses into direct statement: newspaper phrase becomes literal guiding principle. "Empathy can be found where light is dimmest" is echoed verbatim in Lena’s thoughts, violating subtext rules. No resonant reconfiguration—closure states the moral instead of showing it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong in bioluminescent details ("water’s glow seemed to be pulsing"), but register drift into therapy-speak ("jaded wonder," "humanity she had lost") undermines voice. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "began to sense") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: "ethereal glow," "otherworldly light," "bioluminescent energy" repeat within 50 words. Filter-verb stack ("felt the weight... felt like... felt an inexplicable connection") in discovery beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty; momentum stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Derivative premise: memory-erasure trope paired with "empathy quest" lacks fresh synthesis. Bioluminescent lake and signed baseball feel like checklist items—no transformation of familiar elements. Emotional truth diluted by abstract phrasing ("kindle empathy where none remained").</comment>
