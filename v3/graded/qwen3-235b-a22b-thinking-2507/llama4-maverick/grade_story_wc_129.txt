<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Lyra applies no meaningful pressure. Final change feels earned yet under-tested by micro-choices during the tag discovery climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (transformed ache), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—finding the tag resolves isolation instantly without narrowing options or visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard described lyrically yet functions as backdrop, not constraint; micro-setting (tag symbol) charges the ending but never pressures tactics during the search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging) signaled early but pressure never escalates—the effortless tag discovery and instant community acceptance lack concrete tests or trade-offs; agency remains passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the arbor’s evolution, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "webs of kinship" with earned resonance, though resolution lacks friction to deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminescent ache," kinship webs") sustains voice, but stress compression under pressure is muted—tag discovery uses uniform lyrical diction without tactical diction shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with minor redundancies: "glimmering obsidian arbor" phrasing near-echoes (synonym churn risk) and final paragraph’s "breathtaking/awe" slightly overwrites the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "artist finds community" trope via crystalline orchard specificity and ache-to-peace arc, but street artist tag device feels convenient rather than organically pressured.</comment>
