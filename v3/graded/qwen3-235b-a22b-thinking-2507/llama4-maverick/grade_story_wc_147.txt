<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks embodied contradiction; label-only emotions ("overwhelming sense of purpose," "deep sense of connection") dominate peak beats without micro-choices under pressure. Diagnostic phrasing like "sense of wonder and awe" triggers deduction in climactic moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("deep sense of loss," "heavy heart"), but lens ambiguity (shifts between Accumulative and weak Causal) undermines escalation. "Unsnarling" lacks causal logic—no visible mechanics for how mind-focus alters energy—hindering pressure legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystal vial functions as micro-setting object charging closure (light fading as melancholy hits), meeting 9+ gate. But temple setting remains static backdrop; salt/decay sensory details don't constrain choices despite vividness, capping near top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memories) signaled early, but escalation fails: "time runs short" is vague urgency without narrowing options or tactical shifts. Cost appears only at end as melancholy, unearned by prior pressure—no visible price paid during the "unsnarling" process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges through vial/whispers, but ending moralizes explicitly ("memories would live on," "bittersweet reminder"), violating organic emergence. No resonant non-literal answer—closure states the moral rather than reweighting prior material through image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong lyrical texture ("lonesome splendor," "gathered hush") with consistent perceptual signature, but voice lacks pressure modulation—identical cadence during high-stakes work and reflection dulls immediacy. Single POV stable but authorial tone overrides character-specific bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague high-pressure beats: "gathered hush" restated verbatim, "lonesome splendor" repeated with identical phrasing. Filter-verb stacks ("Kael felt," "Kael knew") cluster during climax, dulling propulsion despite otherwise vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Premise (underwater memory temple) offers fresh angle, but execution relies on mythic archetypes without transformation. Emotional progression ("wonder to melancholy") feels generic; specificity lacks human complexity. Avoids safety middle but no risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
