<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("wistfully pragmatic," "sense of peace") without embodied contradiction; the lockmaster reflection adds backstory but doesn't alter present tactics or reveal flawed judgment under pressure. No visible struggle between contradictory impulses during pruning, making the final choice feel serene rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (city wrapped in tranquility) but cost remains conceptual—"fleeting nature of life" is stated, not shown through tangible consequence. Lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural intent falters when the rosebush pruning lacks causal weight, shifting toward Situational without teaching the pattern past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Harbor and fire escape create vivid atmosphere, but neither constrains choices—pruning occurs without environmental friction. The lockmaster's tooth glows symbolically yet never functions as micro-setting; its "intricate markings" don't alter the gardener's actions beyond reflection, missing the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("bring light into darkness") stay abstract; no escalation occurs as the gardener faces zero opposition. The "quivering hush" deepens mood but doesn't narrow options or change knowledge—pressure remains atmospheric rather than tightening agency. Final "resilience" symbolism lacks felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme over-explained through direct statements ("reflect light into dark corners," "beauty requires care"), violating organic emergence. Final moralizing ("delicate thing, requiring care") triggers Thematic Echo penalty; the lockmaster tooth's "hidden depths" symbolism feels imposed rather than earned through conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice suffers from template cadence ("as they worked... as they thought... as the night wore on") creating rhythmic uniformity. Perceptual signature is generic—phrases like "sacred ritual" lack character-specific bias. No compression under non-existent stress, flattening emotional texture despite lyrical surface.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("quivering hush gave way to calm... gave way to new day") and stacked filter verbs ("their eyes were drawn," "thoughts turned to") dull immediacy. Final paragraph's redundant abstractions ("delicate thing, requiring care") trigger Overwriting Checks; template cadence in closure beat disallows 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Familiar "guardian of hidden beauty" trope executed generically—the lockmaster tooth adds novelty but no transformation of emotional stakes. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: rosebush resilience and harbor rhythm feel like symbolic checkboxes rather than specific, lived choices with authentic friction.</comment>
