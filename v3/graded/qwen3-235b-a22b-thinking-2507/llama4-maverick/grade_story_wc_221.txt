<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on labels ("overwhelming disconnection") without embodied contradiction; "blessed pariah" status remains abstract despite sketching showing micro-choice. No visible tradeoffs in final step forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (stagnation abandoned for uncertain hope), but the cost isn't concretely paid on-page beyond emotional shift. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural through density shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Gilded compass rose constrains choice by aligning with the light, charging the final image. However, "time dilation observation deck" remains static backdrop without affecting tactics despite decay descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract (disconnection vs. hope) without testing; the flickering light introduces pressure but lacks escalation or trade-offs. "Confusion into exploration" motivation isn't conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through compass rose reweighting (true north as future hope), avoiding moralizing. Sketching tradition provides earned resonance, but "blessed pariah" concept feels disconnected from thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice shows distinct perceptual signature in star-sketching details and rhythmic control ("stars twinkling like diamonds"), though "temporally stretched existence" drifts into clinical diction during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in paragraph 3 ("Aria felt... Aria's thoughts... Aria began") triggers -0.4; "echoed silence" repetition creates minor loop. Final image achieves high density but "gilded compass rose applique" is clunky.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation deck with family tradition avoids cliché, but "blessed pariah" trope lacks transformation. Emotional truth in sketching elevates specificity without quirky ornamentation.</comment>
