<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("complex web of fears") without embodied contradiction; the conscience's "sincerely insincere" trait is stated but never tested in micro-choices under pressure during the unhooking climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (fragile self-reflection in the shard), but lens ambiguity persists until the wind chime payoff; the Accumulative/Textural drive isn't fully taught until the third paragraph, delaying causal coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse breeze and wind chimes create vivid atmosphere, but setting never constrains choice—e.g., the "breezy" condition doesn’t affect the chime deciphering or mirror handling, failing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (certainty suffocating nuance) tighten meaningfully when the conscience realizes their client’s flaw, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the "unhooking" feels passive rather than a costly choice that narrows options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hollow mirror’s "protected vulnerability," avoiding moralizing; the final image ("fragile and uncertain" reflection) reweights the premise with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in chime/mirror descriptions, but "sincerely insincere" recurs as a tic without stress-induced diction shifts; psychic distance remains static during the high-pressure unhooking beat, diluting urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Template cadence in "As they listened... As they worked..." weakens propulsion; the mixed metaphor ("complex web... like fishing net") and overwritten finale ("whispered promise of complexities") trigger −0.5 per Text-Artifact Screen, capping high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh specificity, but "cloak of doubt" leans generic; risk-taking in the conscience’s moral ambiguity elevates stakes, though the mirror shard’s trope echoes limit full 9+ distinction.</comment>
