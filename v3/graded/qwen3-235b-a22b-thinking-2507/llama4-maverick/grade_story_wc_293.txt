<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction surfaces in the fiddler's conflict between recreating lost melody and preoccupation with the hitchhiker, but "luminous disbelief" and "sculpt possibility" employ abstract therapy-speak that flattens embodied emotion during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure fails the cost proof test: the fiddler's "weight lifting" and "world unfolding" depict relief without legible sacrifice, violating Earned Stasis requirements; hitchhiker disappearance remains an untested backstory echo rather than causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mountain pullout functions as micro-setting through scaffold wrap's "hidden pattern," but fog/mist descriptions become generic atmospheric filler rather than constraining choices; glass flake's physicality charges the final image yet lacks mid-scene tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("weight of secrets") without concrete narrowing of options; pixelated amnesty introduces theoretical pardon but generates zero on-page pressure or trade-offs, leaving escalation inert despite lyrical intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Theme collapses under final-paragraph moralizing ("testament to power of art," "transformative power of music"), triggering Thematic Echo penalties; "ashes of 'never'" is recycled abstraction rather than earned resonance through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV maintains consistent lyricism, but "dynamically observant" trait manifests only as passive noticing ("eyes lingering," "gaze drifted") without altering focalization choices under pressure, diluting agency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwriting plagues peak beats: "river of light," "luminous disbelief," and "sculpt possibility" stack abstract metaphors; template cadence ("As they stood... As the notes faded... As they packed") dulls closure momentum in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Derivative premise (tortured artist finds redemption via object) relies on stock motifs (glass fragment, amnesty); "pixelated" tech-jargon grafted onto pastoral setting feels gimmicky rather than organic transformation.</comment>
