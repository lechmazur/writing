<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("orderly intuitive nature," "hopeful desperation") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices absent during pivotal graffiti deployment. Cost of endurance feels abstract despite Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density increase in graffiti beats, but escalation lacks narrowing options—unity emerges without obstacles. Cost proof weak: foundation stone chip's significance told, not viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid initial carnival sensory details, but setting remains backdrop; foundation stone chip fails as micro-setting by not constraining choices (e.g., no scene where Ava handles it under pressure).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gentrification) signaled early, but pressure never tightens—Ava's graffiti spreads unopposed. No visible price paid; "unity" resolves conflict without dramatized cost or tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of community resilience emerges through graffiti narrative but collapses into moralizing: "testament to strength of community" in final paragraph triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable single-POV voice lacks distinct texture; rhythmic uniformity ("Ava, with her...") dulls pressure. Perceptual signature absent—descriptions reflect generic observer, not culture shock absorber's professional lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Competent prose with minor scaffold ("navigated the complex web") and abstract phrasing ("spirit that could not be bought"). No closure-dulling loops, but "living, breathing entity" risks purple prose in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Floating city premise fresh, but gentrification resistance feels template-like; "culture shock absorber" role underutilized as professional lens. Emotional truth generic—lacks verifiable detail transforming familiar conflict.</comment>
