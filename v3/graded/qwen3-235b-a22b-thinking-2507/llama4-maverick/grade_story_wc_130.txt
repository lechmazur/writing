<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("mathematics of emotion") without embodied contradictions; "ambiguous loss" stated but not viscerally shown through micro-choices during ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("fluid landscape" insight), but "ambiguous loss" lacks pinpoint legibility; Accumulative lens holds yet cost feels diffuse despite moon-silence escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory density excels (luminescent fungi, dripping stalactites), yet cavern orchard functions as backdrop rather than constraining choice; glass eyes charge final image but micro-setting doesn't alter ritual tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("mathematics of emotion") remains abstract; escalation through atmospheric pressure (moon/silence) lacks concrete obstacle testing commitment, leaving stakes felt but not viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing but "fluid, ever-changing landscape" insight borders on thematic echo; resonance emerges through orchard's transformation yet risks abstraction without sufficient concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("branches etched like pen and ink drawing") with rhythmic control, though minor register drifts ("deep-seated desire") undercut voice consistency under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density marred by scaffold loops ("air seemed to vibrate... conjurer felt weight"); final "realm of possibility" line risks thematic echo, dulling closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist studying emotion" trope via cavern orchard setting, yet "mathematics of emotion" concept lacks fresh inflection; emotional specificity avoids genericity but risks familiar abstraction.</comment>
