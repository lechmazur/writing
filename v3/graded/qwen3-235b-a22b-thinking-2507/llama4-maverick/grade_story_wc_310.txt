<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority remains abstract; "stellar doubt" stated not embodied. Final choice lacks visible cost or contradictory impulses, reducing earnedness despite coherent arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise but cost proof fails—no on-page sentence shows sacrifice. "Stellar doubt" dissipates without consequence, weakening the Accumulative lens at climax when alignment feels unearned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor atmosphere, but setting never constrains choices. The distillation apparatus appears functional yet swappable; micro-setting potential unused despite strong specificity in aroma and starlight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>No pressure escalation under Accumulative lens—prophecy "reveals" insights without struggle. Stakes remain abstract; "stellar doubt" never manifests as concrete conflict, failing to narrow options or impose trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic connection emerges organically, but "stellar doubt" resolves into unearned contentment. Final image lacks non-literal reweighting; avoids sentimentality yet misses complexity by omitting the doubt's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory details ("tang of starlight"), but "quietly enthusiastic" repeats as tic. Voice modulates well under pressure except for abstract phrases like "wavelength align" that disrupt POV consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Beautiful rhythm in opening, but overwriting dilutes climax: "shimmering droplet... imbued with essence" uses stacked modifiers. Filter-verb clusters ("could glean," "felt a thrill") dull immediacy in high-pressure distillation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise (universe contraction/backwards prophecy) transformed via distillation ritual, yet emotional specificity lacks risk. "Stellar doubt" offers non-obvious angle but retreats into safe resolution, avoiding bold engagement with its own premise.</comment>
