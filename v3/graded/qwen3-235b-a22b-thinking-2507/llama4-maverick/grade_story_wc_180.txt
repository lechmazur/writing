<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "endearingly feisty" trait remains label-only without contradictory action; Aria's return lacks prior causality for earned reunion. Emotional progression feels tidied rather than layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (Aria's ribbon moment), but "when" anchor delayed past 120 words triggers -0.3 Orientation penalty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory buildup to Charged Poise ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting: resilient tree constrains Elara's ribbon ritual and charges final image. Sensory details ("quartz-eye," rustling leaves) filter through mender's priorities without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging wisdom gap) tightens via seed-planting action, but pressure lacks visible cost escalation; Aria's return resolves off-page tension without prior causal steps under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "deciduous" motif reweighted by final ribbon moment, avoiding moralizing. But "accidental wisdom" concept stated explicitly in climax weakens organic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz-eye mender," "deciduous vows") modulates with emotional intensity. Minor register drift in "symbolic gesture" momentarily breaks voice consistency during peak action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "endearingly feisty" and "symbolic gesture" constitute label-speak in high-pressure beats, triggering -0.4 artifact penalty. Final line's "flourished, nurtured" slightly overwrites.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of "deciduous vows" with orchard ecology feels inevitable, though breach-of-contract premise edges toward template. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
