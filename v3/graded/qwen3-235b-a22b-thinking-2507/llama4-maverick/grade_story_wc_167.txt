<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "noctilucent reckonings" treated as abstract concept rather than embodied conflict. Motivation clear but no earned change—she begins and ends in identical reflective state without visible cost. Diagnostic label-speak ("reads between lines") replaces concrete struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis works for accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract ("urgency to capture moment") with no legible on-page price paid. Orientation solid (anchors by para 1), yet escalation fails: stone-throwing causes ripples that immediately still without narrowing options or altering tactics. Cost proof test fails—no exact image where consequence crystallizes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (water/ripples) charges final image ("calm surface reflected sky"), satisfying 9+ gate. Mist-to-clarity progression mirrors internal shift with sensory specificity ("salty air," "facets glinting"). But environment never constrains choices—glazier remains passive observer, so setting lacks causal pressure despite vivid texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("capture beauty before shift") signaled early but never tests commitment—urgency evaporates when ripples stilled. Zero escalation: no narrowing options, trade-offs, or credible loss (e.g., time, tools). Agency is passive observation; "before everything shifts" remains vague time pressure without live clock tightening moves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of illuminating mundane beauty emerges through water/ripples imagery, with final "clear complexity" reweighting prior material without stated moral. But "illuminate value in the mundane" is directly echoed twice, bordering on thematic echo that risks prompt-like language in peak beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/refraction focus) and rhythmic control anchor voice. However, filter-verb stacks ("Her eyes wandered... She felt...") proliferate during urgency beat, violating stress-compression principle. Psychic distance remains stable but diction lacks modulation under pressure—no short-term syntax tightening when "sense of urgency" peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Two paraphrase loops ("sense of peace settle over her" verbatim repeat) and template cadence in climax ("She felt... She knew... She felt...") trigger -0.6 deduction. Final third artifacts ("heart full of clear complexity") prevent 9+ eligibility. Strong opening rhythm degrades into abstract lyricism during key realization beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "glazier as meaning-seeker" avoids artist clichés, but prism atrium/ripples feel derivative. Emotional specificity in dawn contemplation elevates familiarity, yet transformation test fails—swapping "glazier" for "poet" requires minimal edits. No bold risk-taking beyond standard epiphany structure.</comment>
