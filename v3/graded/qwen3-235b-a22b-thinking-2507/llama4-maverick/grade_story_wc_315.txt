<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "pride and accomplishment" after high-stakes work reads as emotional arithmetic, not layered struggle. Diagnostic label "preserving trust" replaces embodied cost, triggering -0.5 penalty. Contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lacks felt cost: "stars fading but essence captured" soft-resets pressure without dramatized consequence. Two distinct non-closure issues (soft reset + undramatized burden) apply -0.8 cap. Orientation solid but Earned Stasis fails due to unearned "sense of pride" contradicting prior weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nocturnal arbor functions as micro-setting but never constrains choice; "wooden slats" and "clouds" described beautifully yet passively. Misses 9+ gate by lacking causal pressure on final image despite vivid specificity. Parachute buckle’s physicality could charge closure but remains ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping danger) declared but never viscerally tested; pressure remains abstract. "Weight settling" claims cost but shows no tactical alteration or earned trade-off. Agency passive—revisions happen "to her," not through choices. Missing visible price that charges final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic Echo fatal: "preserving trust" and "beauty beyond mundane world" explicitly state thesis in final paragraphs. Recurring "watcher’s burden" remains abstract label rather than emergent from concrete struggle. Closure’s "trust preserved" moralizing replaces earned resonance with sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "star-studded canvas" and "ethereal glow" but falters under pressure: "mind racing with implications" reverts to generic abstraction. Rhythmic control strong yet "soundless echo" repetition becomes scaffold. No head-hopping but emotional ventriloquism dilutes Lyra’s specificity during peak focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop: "silence... palpable, a soundless echo that seemed to reverberate" (adjacent redundancy). Filter-verb stack near closure ("Lyra felt... knew... would return") dulls immediacy. High-density prose saved by "velvet expanse" specificity, but template cadence ("As the night wore on...") triggers -0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cloud jumper" premise offers fresh angle yet tropes dominate ("midnight pattern seeker"). Emotional truth diluted by abstract stakes; specific cloud-mapping details never transform generic "danger" into lived reality. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds but lacks the non-obvious moral calculus required for 9+.</comment>
