<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" trait stated but not shown altering choices; internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in action. Label-heavy emotion ("sorrowful tune") weakens embodiment despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost (exhaustion, bittersweet permanence), but hourglass redundancy ("after the final grain slips...") breaks causality in pivotal beat, triggering Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel constrains every choice (sound amplification) and charges the final image (sanctuary reconfiguration). Micro-setting (worn pull cord) directly shapes the legacy beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (lost laughter) tighten via leaf blower's physical toll and memory release, but "restore joy" lacks tangible cost until closure. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens with visible exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sound/machinery metaphors, but "true haunting" in final paragraph states thesis outright, triggering thematic echo penalty that dulls earned resonance of the laughter motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mournful melody," "off-key wind") and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates from "deafening roars" to "soothing balm" with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("mournful melody"/"sorrowful tune") and label-heavy phrasing ("unspoken emotions") dull two high-pressure beats. Strong propulsion otherwise, but artifacts prevent 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of leaf blower/conductor trope with emotional specificity, but "hollow shell" and "haunting beauty" verge on cliché. Risk-taking (sound as memory catalyst) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
