<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("melancholy mood," "heart ached") without embodied contradiction; motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" is told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. No visible struggle when deciding to reconnect—shift feels unearned despite poignant closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost: keeper steps forward knowing isolation is impossible, crystallizing the "refuge reborn" essence. But lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—textural accumulation isn't firmly established until keeper descends, weakening early causality coherence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ashen charcoal sanctuary functions as micro-setting: the doorknocker ring's evolution (dull grey to ethereal glow) charges the final image, and "loaded emptiness" atmosphere directly constrains keeper's choices (isolation → reconnection). Avoids postcard description by tethering sensory details to emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve sanctuary) tightens meaningfully as threshold wanes, forcing keeper's reconnection. Agency drives escalation—keeper actively "reaches out," "navigates," and revives the flame—but cost remains internal (emotional shift) without tangible tradeoffs, limiting higher-band eligibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sanctuary's rebirth metaphor: "teach suffocating to breathe" crystallizes in keeper's final step into possibility. Avoids moralizing, but secondary theme of "burns bridges carefully" lacks integration, diluting resonance compared to the potent core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ashen charcoal," "dark tentacles") modulates with pressure, yet tense shifts ("had dulled," "reached out") create inconsistent psychic distance. Voice cohesion frays during high-stakes moments where diction turns abstract ("paradox that lay at the heart of their existence").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Severe overwriting in closure beat: "doorknocker ring seemed to glow with a soft, ethereal light" stacks redundant modifiers. Template cadence ("The keeper's touch was gentle... The keeper's footsteps echoed...") dulls immediacy in high-pressure scenes, triggering -1.7 penalty for artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gothic tropes (sanctuary as emotional refuge) feels inevitable, but risks remain surface-level (lyrical compression without structural innovation). Derivative elements ("skeletal hand" doorknocker) slightly undermine authenticity, preventing 9+ despite strong emotional specificity.</comment>
