<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for preserving heritage remains abstract despite "rescuing dying arts" mention; no micro-choice under pressure showing contradictory impulses when ice thaws. Interiority relies on labels ("historically oriented mind") rather than embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "weight settling like a mantle" crystallizing Elena's commitment, but cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through ice thaw cadence shift reweighting cultural stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminescent fungi and bread sculptures function as micro-setting that charges the final image, with sensory details (damp earth, rosewater dread) filtered through Elena's curator perspective. Bread initials constrain no choice but charge closure through tangible history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving displaced persons' stories) lacks concrete on-page test; thaw reveals history passively rather than forcing Elena's active choice with trade-off. "Rosewater dread" signals tension but no narrowing of options or visible cost during revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread sculptures as non-literal answer to cultural preservation, avoiding moralizing. Undermined by "testament to the power of history" abstraction in final paragraph, slightly over-articulating the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "trained to appreciate ancient architecture" observations. Consistent free indirect style modulates with tension ("atmosphere... tense"), though "rosewater dread" borders on ornamental lyricism without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread hanging like a mist" creates mixed metaphor; "weight settling like a mantle" is scaffolded cliché. Otherwise strong propulsion, but minor figurative muddle in high-pressure thaw sequence prevents 8.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bread-as-history-archive feels inevitable for grotto setting. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, though "displaced persons" framing edges toward recognizable refugee narrative without sufficiently specific moral calculus.</comment>
