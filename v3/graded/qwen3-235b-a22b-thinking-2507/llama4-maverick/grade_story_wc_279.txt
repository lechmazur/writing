<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("socially perceptive soul," "unlearning") dominates interiority without embodied contradiction; final change lacks earned causality as turmoil remains abstractly described rather than tested through concrete micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in the transformed "lilac unease," but escalation lacks protagonist agency—tile falls coincidentally, mandala "reveals" truths passively, failing cost proof test as no exact line shows paid price beyond vague unease.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting with "tendrils curling" affecting the mandala, but fails 9+ gate: environment never constrains choices (tile fall is coincidence, not pressure), merely framing atmosphere without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("discover meaning in the mess") tighten through sensory density, but escalation isn't driven by agency—the artist reacts to mandala/tile rather than making trade-offs; no visible price (e.g., lost time/tool) alters her tactics during the "interject" moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mandala patterns avoiding moralizing, but "discover meaning in the mess" is stated outright mid-story, risking thematic echo; final mist-step image resonates yet lacks the non-literal reweighting required for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of damp earth," "tendrils of fog") shines, but rhythmic control falters under peak stress—diction stays uniformly poetic during "painful unlearning" without syntactic compression to reflect turmoil.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she worked... As the design...") and "lilac unease" repetition (4x) in final third trigger -0.5 artifact penalty; beautiful imagery but scaffold loops dull closure momentum without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" offers fresh emotional specificity, but "unlearning" premise feels familiar; transformation test fails—replace "chalk artist" with "potter" and the same arc works, lacking irreplaceable synthesis.</comment>
