<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses in action; "molting personalities" stated not shown during rebuilding. Final choice lacks visible cost—prison friendship motivates but doesn't constrain tactics. "Luminous fracture" overwrites embodied emotion with abstract labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("city not yet saved"), but stakes remain abstract—no on-page resistance pressure tests the poet's resolve. Moonrise timeframe creates gentle escalation but no narrowing of options; rebuilding feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rusted library details evoke decay/resilience ("rusty hinges creaked"), yet setting never constrains choices—broken furniture is a "canvas," not an obstacle. Final dawn image resonates but lacks causal tie to earlier specifics; coffee tin's "false bottom" is ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild library/city) signaled early but never pressured—no tangible obstacles or trade-offs. "Daunting task" declared but no earned reversal: poet transitions instantly from reflection to action without friction. Cost remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "forge beauty from anarchy" but lacks earned reweighting—the dawn-lit rebirth confirms initial hope rather than transforming it. Avoids moralizing, yet final "luminous fracture" echoes abstractly without deepening prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon cleared the skyline, casting silver glow") and rhythmic control in opening, but stress flattens voice: rebuilding uses generic terms like "excitement and trepidation." No dialogue present, so those criteria exempt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "thoughts turned to..." repetition in reflection beats. Strong specificity ("torn paper, rusty keys") but "fragments of broken dreams" slips into abstraction. Final line’s "luminous fracture" overwrites emotional complexity without legible cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar premise (vagrant rebuilding library) elevated by prison backstory and coffee tin details, yet tropes remain untransformed—no fresh inflection where stakes test the poet’s resolve. Emotional specificity in friendship lacks causal pressure on rebuilding choices.</comment>
