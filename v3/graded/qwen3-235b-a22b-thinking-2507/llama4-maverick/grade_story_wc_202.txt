<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation resurfaces organically but lacks contradictory impulses; Lena's shift from curiosity to mission commitment lacks internal friction or visible tradeoffs during pivotal painting discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (permanently altered perception), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful tightening; pressure remains static after lens fragment purchase with no narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Market's sensory details (sandalwood, crystal facets) function as micro-setting that charges the final image; rooftops transforming from "mundane sprawl" to "canvas" constrains Lena's newfound purpose with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("honor forgotten tales") never faces concrete on-page test; pressure fails to cohere as Lena moves unimpeded from discovery to commitment without resistance or tactical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars but final paragraph's moralizing ("weave a new narrative... honor the overlooked") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, replacing earned resonance with stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("elusively tangible," "whispers and secrets") persists under pressure, but "eternal instant" repetition creates scaffold loops that dull immediacy in climax beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High textural specificity falters in peak beats: "boundless expanse of possibility" and "heart afire" are generic abstractions; filter-verb stacks ("Lena felt... Lena knew") weaken propulsion during closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of translator/alchemy tropes through specific "anchors of intuition" framework, but risk-taking remains surface-level; emotional truth lacks complexity as Lena's transformation encounters zero friction.</comment>
