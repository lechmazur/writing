<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("lucidly watchful," "turmoil brewing") dominates peak beats without embodied contradiction; ghostly cameo resolves conflict externally rather than earned internal shift. Protagonist's fear of failure lacks specific physical manifestation or tactical trade-offs during writing attempts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation fails: "feral nexus" remains spatially unanchored past 120 words, weakening mist/shell context. Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—talisman's significance emerges too late without prior constraint on choices. Lens ambiguity undermines Accumulative/Textural escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting functions decoratively: mist and shell lack causal pressure on choices (e.g., no physical interaction with shell altering tactics). "Feral nexus" remains undefined atmosphere rather than constraint; micro-setting fails to charge closure despite lyrical repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("fear of failure") declared but never tested through action; ghostly cameo resolves conflict via coincidence rather than protagonist agency. "Against the current" only echoes thematically—no tactical narrowing or visible price paid during writing attempts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("lessons of the feral nexus," "shapes of different hopes") states moral rather than emerging from particulars. CR attempt fails as shell's transformation to "talisman" lacks conceptual cost reweighting prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV leaks into abstraction ("turmoil brewing," "essence of human experience") diluting perceptual signature. Register drift into academic diction ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo") clashes with novelist's voice during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("swirling mist"/"swirling patterns"/"swirling hush") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt... she knew...") in climax dull immediacy. Template cadence ("she felt a sense of...") pervades final third, disallowing 9+ globally per artifact policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Derivative writer's-block trope with "feral nexus" and "shapes of hopes" feeling prompt-generated. Transformation test fails—swap "novelist" for "painter" and narrative logic remains identical; no fresh inflection on familiar material.</comment>
