<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks embodied contradiction; "dimensionally homesick" remains abstract label without trade-offs in choices. Final peace feels unearned as no visible cost alters tactics despite weight "lifted".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual ("weight lifted") without on-page sacrifice. Mist clearing reconfigures meaning yet lacks felt price—where is the irreversible loss?</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains movement (mist "restraining" ankles) and charges closure: statues shift from "macabre grins" to "serene" faces as micro-setting. Pendant’s glow directly reweights opening desecration attempt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract ("boundaries of light"); waiting lacks tangible cost or narrowed options. Pressure accumulates via mist thickening but resolves without sacrifice—peace feels granted, not earned through trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Making friends with uncertainty" emerges organically from garden’s transformation, not stated moral. Final pendant glow reweights cultist’s desecration as key—resonant without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("damp shroud," "ethereal tentacles") modulates with emotional state; sentence rhythms vary from urgent fragments to flowing reverie. Zero head-hopping despite layered consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor abstraction ("morbid perfume") in high-pressure beats, but density remains high. Final image avoids overwriting: "pendant remained, a tangible connection" charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "library guardian" trope via psychological specificity—feral yet burdened. Emotional truth in responsibility struggle elevates mist motif beyond cliché; fresh synthesis of dimensional anxiety and custodianship.</comment>
