<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation for "unused love" remains abstract without embodied contradiction; Aria shifts from skepticism to belief in pilgrim without struggle, violating causality. Micro-choices lack trade-offs—breathing exercises yield instant epiphany with no cost. Interiority relies on label-heavy phrases ("sense of longing," "deep connection") rather than character-specific embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "twilight viaduct" setting anchors only at 138 words, triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Charged Poise: "love flowing into darkness") carries conceptual cost but lens ambiguity—Accumulative/Textural vs. Hybrid—undermines escalation. Pilgrim's disappearance lacks consequence, weakening causality in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wisteria's sensory details (scent, "ethereal light") vividly anchor atmosphere but remain decorative; viaduct exerts no pressure on choices (e.g., Aria could have epiphany elsewhere). Micro-setting fails 9+ gate: Kwan Yin's Tear is handled but doesn't constrain tactics or charge closure. Strong specificity in "foggy lucidity" elevates tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("heal hidden wound") is declared but never tested—pilgrim's quest resolves via convenient breathing exercises with no escalation. Two distinct Non-closure issues: undeveloped antagonistic pressure (-0.8) and zero cost for Aria's transformation (Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies). Stakes remain abstract, unmoored from on-page choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic Echo cripples resonance: pilgrim's line "The love you seek is within" (-0.6 penalty) states the thesis outright. Unused love concept lacks earned complexity—it surfaces via breathing without struggle—yet final image ("wisteria whisper benediction") avoids moralizing, salvaging partial thematic weight through sensory reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spiritually curious" lens colors wisteria as "tiny stars") and rhythmic control shine, but pilgrim's dialogue lacks voice distinction (both speak in hushed, lyrical cadence). Register drift: "respiration," "conduit for the divine" feel academic, not character-particular. No head-hopping; elision of past life memory taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Template cadence ("seemed to," "felt a") in paragraph 1 creates synonym churn ("ethereal light," "foggy lucidity," "mystical ambiance"). Filter-verb stacks ("her mind wandered," "fingers went," "felt a surge") dull immediacy in high-pressure beat. Final image ("petals swaying like ethereal dancers") avoids muddle, but artifacts in first third disallow 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Derivative premise: "crystal pendant with goddess's compassion" and "pilgrim of sparks" echo spiritual tropes without fresh synthesis. Camera obscura artist angle unused—no specific detail ties profession to choices. Risk distinction fails; "unused love" concept feels generic, lacking verifiable emotional truth. Transformation test: plot works unchanged with different names.</comment>
