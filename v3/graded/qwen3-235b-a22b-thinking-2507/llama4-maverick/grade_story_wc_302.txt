<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("burning desire") without embodied contradiction; diagnostic labels like "weight lifting" undermine interiority; no visible flaws complicate choices despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (watch's ticking, mist parting), but "forever changed" overstatement weakens legibility; lens (Accumulative) holds though causality gaps linger in watch's function.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glowing library functions as micro-setting—mist constrains movement, luminescence charges final image—but over-reliance on "mist" repetitions dilutes specificity; tools like the watch lack tangible impact on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through documentation attempts, but pressure lacks visceral cost escalation; "fateful letters" timeframe signals tension without constraining decisions, missing tangible trade-offs for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</comment><comment>Theme of unspoken words resonates through library whispers, but final "forever changed" moralizing undercuts earned ambiguity; conceptual repricing occurs yet thematic echo in last paragraph triggers -0.7 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "veiled" observations and rhythmic control ("cautious exuberance" modulation) shine, though "mist" repetition creates scaffold loops under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid textural density falters with synonym churn ("swirling"/"parting" mist) and three "cautious exuberance" repetitions; final paragraph's looped "mist" phrasing dulls closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-state-of-being elevates trope, but safety-hedging in "forever changed" resolution avoids bold stakes; emotional specificity lacks transformative risk-taking for higher bands.</comment>
