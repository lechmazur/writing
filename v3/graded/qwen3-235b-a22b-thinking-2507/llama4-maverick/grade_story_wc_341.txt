<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("handwriting reflecting dusty starlight tone") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation to "prove empty spaces remembered" remains abstract without tactical struggle or visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: "spooled wholeness" realization feels unearned as Lyra passively observes calming clouds with no sacrifice; orientation is clear but Accumulative lens fails cost proof test at ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sky gondola functions as micro-setting—telescope handling and cloud observation constrain choices; "dusty starlight" tone charges final image though weather details remain generic post-storm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prove empty spaces remembered") never materializes in concrete pressure; telescope/mentor reflections deepen theme but no tightening choice alters tactics—calming clouds resolve tension without Lyra's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spooled wholeness" metaphor but final line ("sense of peace") oversimplifies complexity; avoids moralizing yet lacks conceptual repricing with undeniable cost at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds by emotion" lens) sustains voice; tense shifts during reflection anchor present stakes though "dusty starlight" repetition risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High density in atmospheric descriptions but final beat suffers template cadence ("Lyra felt... her heart swelled... eyes shining") diluting closure impact; minimal synonym loops outside peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and emotional cartography feels organic, yet "quietly explosive" storm lacks transformation; specificity in gondola work elevates beyond tropes but stakes remain under-tested.</comment>
