<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "latent sacrifice" is diagnostic label-speak without embodied cost. Motivation remains abstract ("impossible distance") with no concrete micro-choices under pressure. Amber bead functions as passive symbol rather than active constraint on decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with the raveling silence becoming a bridge, but cost feels conceptual not visceral. Escalation lacks one decisive intensification beat; puzzle assembly creates gentle rhythm but no narrowing of options under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by word 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Bamboo forest/orchard creates vivid atmosphere but fails micro-setting test: environment never constrains choices (e.g., no thread snagged by bamboo, puzzle pieces obscured by leaves). Amber bead charges final image but doesn't alter tactics earlier. Misses 9+ gate by lacking causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("raveling silence") remains abstract despite poetic framing; no on-page moment where options narrow or cost manifests concretely. Puzzle assembly deepens reflection but doesn't transform tactics. Pressure accumulates texturally yet lacks the required felt price on closure image per Accumulative lens standards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through weaving/puzzle motifs without moralizing, but final paragraph's "testament to power of love" edges toward thematic echo. Avoids platitude traps yet misses 9+ test by lacking non-literal answer that reweights prior material through concrete action rather than lyric assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stoically sparkling thread" and "dappled light" observations, but filter-verb stacks ("her eyes fixed on," "gaze fell upon") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Cadence loops in closure ("As night fell... As the night wore on") undermine rhythmic control despite otherwise consistent lyrical voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Template cadence runs ("As she worked... As she began... As the image took shape") trigger -0.6 penalty. Synonym churn on "raveling silence" (4 repetitions with minimal variation) and redundant "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" phrasing create scaffold loops that obscure pressure in final third, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transforms "crafting as healing" trope through specific bamboo forest textures and jigsaw mechanics, but emotional arc remains conventional. Lacks fresh inflection where premise follows implications without retreat; "latent sacrifice" concept feels safely middle-ground rather than bold risk-taking despite poetic execution.</comment>
