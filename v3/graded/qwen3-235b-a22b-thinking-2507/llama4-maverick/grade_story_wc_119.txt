<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("sense of calm," "accidentally prophetic nature") without embodied contradiction; no visible micro-choices under pressure despite claimed "orchestration," reducing Oracle to thematic mouthpiece.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: dawn departure shows no legible consequence ("lives forever intertwined" is assertion, not earned change); Accumulative lens weakens as microdot specs never impact choices, leaving pressure untransformed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse functions as atmospheric postcard without constraining choice; "wooden box" recurs but never alters tactics, missing 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint on closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("change life," "new language") with zero on-page cost; stranger's arrival complicates nothing—no narrowing of options or knowledge shift, violating Accumulative escalation requirements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Open secrets" theme stated not earned; final moralizing ("truth that would stay with them forever") triggers Thematic Echo penalty, undermining organic resonance required for higher bands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical cadence sustains POV, but "familiar enigma" repetition becomes tic; dialogue absent, so voice distinction bullet irrelevant, yet over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("mystery," "enigma") dulls perceptual specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pervasive figurative loops ("whispers of the night," "tapestry of open secrets") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; synonym churn on "orchestrate/direct/guide" triggers scaffold penalty in critical closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fortune-teller/spycraft fusion feels derivative without fresh emotional calculus; "mysterious lighthouse" trope lacks specific lived detail to transform premise, failing transformation test.</comment>
