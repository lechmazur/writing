<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme backstory informs no active choices; "virtuously mischievous" is label-only without tradeoffs. Closure lacks visible cost—diamonds represent pure gain, not earned endurance. Diagnostic phrase "shadowseam wonder" appears without embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation fails past 120 words: spatial layout of lab/farm remains vague. Closure lacks legible cost—"weight of diamonds" signifies reward, not sacrifice. Quantum promise resolution feels coincidental (machine operation), not earned causality under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent glow is atmospheric but doesn't constrain choices—mushrooms "celebrate" diamonds without altering tactics. Submarine bolt functions as static token; no micro-setting pressure on final image. Sensory detail selective but lacks causal integration with closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: "pressure into diamonds" goal faces zero resistance or tradeoffs. Stakes remain abstract ("quantum promise") with no dramatized cost. Coincidence (text messages) resolves the conflict it didn't create, violating causality under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "shadowseam wonder" and "magic was waiting" state the thesis explicitly in final paragraph. Conceptual repricing fails—diamonds represent unearned success, not reweighted stakes. No resonant answer to "quantum promise" beyond literal fulfillment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks proliferate in pressure beats ("Lyra felt... she knew... she suspected"). Perceptual signature blurs—mushroom farm descriptions lack character-particular bias. "Virtuously mischievous" repetition creates uniform tics without rhythmic modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in climax: "pressure began to build... pressure reached its peak." Mixed metaphor—"weight of diamonds" (literal) clashes with "weight of the journey" (conceptual). Overwriting in high-pressure beat dilutes momentum with redundant intensifiers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Derivative sci-fi tropes ("glitchy texts," "quantum promise") lack transformation through specific detail. Bioluminescent farm setting feels generic—no fresh inflection beyond visual cliché. Emotional arc resolves into symmetric satisfaction without moral ambiguity.</comment>
