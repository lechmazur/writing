<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; apology motivation clear yet no visible struggle with competing desires during key choices. Flaws don't compound decisions—Lyra's methodical success undermines earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of apology begin to lift") under Accumulative lens, but orchard destruction's conceptual cost remains abstract. Missing one persistent constraint shaping final tactics weakens high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sheet music archive anchors early and charges final image (rustling notes as sent message), yet micro-setting never constrains choices—perfume bottle could exist anywhere. Sensory specificity elevates but lacks tactical integration for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection) tightens via induced currents concept, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; Lyra encounters solutions (perfume bottle, vibrating air) rather than adapting tactics. Cost legible yet abstract, missing visceral trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme of "imperfect miracles" resonates through orchard metaphor and perfume bottle glow, but final "redemption" assertion leans toward moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries yet conceptual repricing lacks the sharp moral calculus required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispered prayers," "grit of imperfections") modulates beautifully under pressure. Minor register drift in "induced currents" phrasing disrupts otherwise impeccable voice consistency during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters in orchard description ("hush before trees were cut down hung in the air") with passive construction. Zero loops but slight overwriting in "ethereal beauty that lay just beneath the surface" dulls final propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcist/gossip columnist tropes through sheet music metaphors elevates premise. Risk-taking with mystical physics feels organic, yet "imperfect miracles" concept lacks the non-obvious moral calculus needed for 8.5+ distinction.</comment>
