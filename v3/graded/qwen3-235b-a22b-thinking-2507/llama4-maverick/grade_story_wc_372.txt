<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "deep motivation" is told not shown through micro-choices. No visible struggle between preservation urgency and personal cost during cataloging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks concrete cost proof; "fading illusions" implies loss but no on-page forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost remains abstract despite quartz hush motif.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting anchors early with "frozen library above clouds" and "quartz hush" motif. Micro-setting (lantern slide) charges final image but doesn't constrain choices; clouds as canvas feels unearned reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("race against time") never materialize as concrete pressure; no tightening of options or trade-offs. Fading illusions remain thematic rather than viscerally felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through luminous vows motif but resolution ("weaver of threads") states the concept rather than reweighting it. Avoids moralizing but lacks earned ambiguity in final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in archival focus ("sampling frequencies," "glass surface etched") with rhythmic control. No head-hopping, but "thrill of excitement" dilutes interiority's authenticity under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops ("illusions of the past began to fade to memory" repeated), synonym churn ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion"). Final image dulled by "shard of luminous vows" abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes through "luminous vows" concept but relies on familiar magical realism templates. Emotional specificity lacks risk; "guardian" role feels safe rather than freshly inevitable.</comment>
