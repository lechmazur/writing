<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through embodied tension easing vs. trauma flashbacks; "quietly talented" trait lacks visible cost demonstration despite micro-choices. Photo-smoothing reveals character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (photo smoothing, heart healing) under Accumulative lens; escalation via sensory density shift lacks one decisive pressure point narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seaside arboretum constrains choice through wind's physical pressure on body/trees; final image of "gentle fingers" recharges twisted branches motif with embodied cost, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trauma vs peace) signaled early but escalation passive; somatic markers deepen internal conflict yet lack causal pressure testing commitment, missing Q4 8.8+ band requirement for visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through arboretum's transformation ("withered fingers" to "gentle fingers") without moralizing; final image reweights "pearl of stillness" as earned resilience, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("blue-gray silk" sea, "soothing melody" waves) modulates with emotional intensity; minor register drift in "somatic markers" phrasing barely avoids diagnostic label penalty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("wind dying down, trees ceasing creaking" mirrors internal calm); slight scaffold in repeated "reaching out" tree imagery prevents 8.5+ band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via arboretum's physical transformation avoids cliché; "lighthouse keeper" detail adds specificity but lacks full integration with core premise's emotional calculus.</comment>
