<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("deep understanding," "sense of purpose") without embodied contradiction; "diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats triggers penalty. Motivation for reshaping reality lacks visible cost or flawed struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "who/where/when" unclear past 120 words (mercury-glass nature unanchored), capping Q3 at 7.0. Closure lacks visible cost—satisfaction replaces legible price; violates Cost Proof Test with no on-page cost sentence at ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity (parchment scent, feather barbs) charges final image as "threshold to new possibilities." Environment functions as micro-setting: stone's pedestal constrains discovery, though bookstore doesn't pressure choices beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("long-forgotten truth") without tangible escalation; pressure fails to narrow options. No visible price paid for reshaping reality—success feels unearned despite "pang of sorrow" mention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Explicit thematic statements ("testament to the power of buried talents") in final paragraph trigger Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext drowns in abstraction; no resonant non-literal answer to "shape of home" central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical texture ("hidden thunder," "restless spirits") but collapses under stress—elevated diction ("profound and mysterious") clashes with peak-moment urgency. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: stacked metaphors ("swirling mists," "electric anticipation") and repetitive stems ("The air was...") trigger −0.7 penalty. Filter-verb clusters dull immediacy during magic climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Derivative mystic-seer tropes (Borges-esque bookstore, "buried talents") lack fresh inflection. Emotional specificity avoids genericity but premise feels templated; no bold risk-taking beyond surface imagery.</comment>
