<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Label-only calmness with no contradictory impulses; "sense of peace" repeated verbatim as diagnostic summary. No micro-choices under pressure despite claimed "quiet intensity."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No escalation or pressure under any lens; closure fails as Charged Poise—stars/vines offer no reconfiguration of stakes or cost. Orientation test passed but zero causality beyond static observation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid lavender/factory contrast lacks constraint on choices; camera/map case described but never tactically engaged. Final image (glowing case) charges closure weakly without altering prior meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("collective healing") remain abstract thematic echoes; no on-page pressure, tightening, or cost. Vines climbing symbolize decay/rebirth but create zero tactical consequence for Luna's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("beauty in decay") stated outright in final paragraph; "testament to art's power" replaces earned resonance with moralizing. CR fails as final image lacks conceptual cost or reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV stable but voice converges into repetitive cadence ("the sound of..."); "earnest whimsy" never modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature diluted by tourist-catalog description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops: "sense of peace" verbatim repetition in final beats; template stems ("as she walked... as she stood..."). Closure-beat artifacts dull cost legibility (-1.7 penalty applied).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Derivative "beauty in ruins" trope without fresh inflection; lavender/factory contrast feels like Pinterest aesthetic. No risk-taking beyond surface-level lyricism.</comment>
