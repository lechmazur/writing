<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "defiant hush" shield against doubts is named but never tested in action. Motivation drives plot yet emotional embodiment remains abstract ("heart swelled") without visceral cost. No visible trade-offs deepen her "luminous skeptic" trait beyond label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Decisive Change: fountains stirring because memories liberated, with "sidereal patience" cost legible in "slow, gentle process." Causal chain holds but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—no setbacks test her patience, making the journey feel frictionless despite stated stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting details like "tattered awning" and "black stone pedestal" anchor atmosphere, but the city rarely constrains choices. Fountains’ revival charges the final image powerfully, yet dry fountains never actively hinder her—environment shapes tone more than tactics during the quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("liberate trapped memories") is clear early, but pressure never escalates meaningfully. Doubts are named but not dramatized as obstacles; "cobwebs of forgotten lore" unstick too easily. Cost remains abstract ("responsibility") without concrete forfeiture altering her tactics mid-quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "stained glass box" reframes history as fragile yet vital. Final image ("fountains singing") resonates as non-literal answer to revival without moralizing. Avoids pitfalls by showing, not telling, how memory liberation reweights the city’s decay into hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ears tuned to city’s whispers") and rhythmic control shine, but "luminous skeptic" label drifts into academic diction. Voice modulates well under pressure yet over-relies on lyrical abstractions ("kaleidoscope of images") that dilute immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong density but paraphrase loops ("determination grew... moved with quiet confidence") and therapy-speak ("heart swelled with excitement and trepidation") dull key moments. Final paragraph’s "would soon become triumphant cry" breaks immediacy, though imagery remains vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" transforms tropes through concrete stakes (slow city revival), and "geese" motif avoids cliché by resonating with her nudge to act. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable, though "luminous skeptic" leans familiar without deeper risk-taking in character choices.</comment>
