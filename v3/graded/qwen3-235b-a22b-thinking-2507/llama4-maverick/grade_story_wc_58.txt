<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous tension; epiphany feels earned but micro-choices under pressure are sparse. The carpet thread touch reveals character, yet "lonesome splendor" labeling risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (snapped thread releasing dust), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) weakens escalation clarity. Cost proof is visible yet slightly abstracted by lyrical phrasing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Shadowed garden actively constrains writing in fading light; decaying leaves and carpet thread charge closure. Sensory specificity anchors tone, though lunar glow shift feels slightly convenient for resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding healing) tightens via thread's snapping with visible cost, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation before closure. Agency in writing feels passive rather than decisive under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through carpet thread's fragility, but final paragraph's explicit "beauty and fragility of life" moralizing triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6). Resonance diluted by stated wisdom over earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent perceptual signature (obituary writer's melancholic precision), yet "morbid perfume" and "lonesome splendor" repetitions risk stock phrasing. Rhythmic control under pressure remains strong despite minor register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Synonym loops ("mournful sigh"/"melancholic shadows") and thematic labeling ("vividly descriptive") dull momentum. Final beat's "bittersweet reminder" overwrites concrete imagery, violating show-don't-tell in closure proximity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituaries for the living with carpet thread symbolism, but "geography of healing" concept leans abstract. Emotional truth in thread's snapping elevates, yet risks derivative lyricism without deeper transformation.</comment>
