<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("world of pain," "universal language") rather than embodied contradiction; the epiphany about translating pain lacks micro-choices that alter present tactics, reducing earnedness of his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof test—the "weight of experiences" is narrated but never legibly paid through constrained action; reflection density doesn't deepen stakes under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid moon/ridge imagery lacks urgency-based sensory narrowing; the porcelain box functions as micro-setting but doesn't constrain choices (e.g., he opens it passively), missing 9+ gate requirement to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens—the reflective tone remains static without pattern break or density increase; "bargained innocence" stake is declared but never viscerally tested or narrowed by on-page choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thematic Echo in final paragraph ("reminder of hard softness") replaces earned resonance with moralizing; the "universal language" concept drifts into abstraction without concrete particulars reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice but perceptual signature lacks firefighter-specific urgency (e.g., terrain hazards ignored for celestial observation); rhythmic control falters with repetitive "Kael's [noun]" stems diluting embodied immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("slow dance of celestial bodies" verbatim reuse) and filter-verb stacks ("Kael felt... Kael realized") dull momentum; final-third artifacts like "fragile beauty" trigger disallowance of 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Scarred firefighter" trope lacks fresh inflection—swap "firefighter" for "soldier" and arc remains unchanged; emotional truth is generic without verifiable detail (e.g., no firefighting-specific trauma shaping choices).</comment>
