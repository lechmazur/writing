<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("serenade monotony") stated but not dramatized with trade-offs. Bishop piece creates no meaningful choice despite two mentions, reducing character-object causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>No legible cost at closure; "infinite possibilities" ending avoids Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orchestrated serendipity remains abstract concept without narrowing options or altering tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm and chess piece create atmospheric texture, but neither constrains choices or charges final image. "Scent of salt" and "waves lapping" lack causal pressure on performance decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("serenade monotony") declared but never tested; performance succeeds without complication. No escalation under Accumulative lens—density increases but options don’t narrow or knowledge shift meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo in finale: "create a sense of connection between mundane and magical" states moral outright. "Testament to power of creativity" sermonizes, violating organic emergence requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice has lyrical consistency ("velvet expanse," "calculated wilderness") but uniform tics under stress; "lightly attentive" repetition flattens perceptual signature during high-pressure performance beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in final third: "soothing melody" (para 1) vs. "soothing background noise" (para 11). Filter-verb stack ("Elian felt... knew... felt") dulls immediacy in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mathematical performer trope transformed via probability focus, but bishop’s "secrets" feels derivative. Emotional specificity lacks fresh inflection—art/science tension resolves into generic wonder.</comment>
