<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("rationally rebellious," "agonize") without embodied contradiction; final smile shows endurance but lacks micro-choices proving earned renunciation. No tangible cost for rejecting official narratives beyond isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (wry smile while contemplating "long road ahead") holds under Accumulative lens with felt cost of perpetual isolation, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—Kael's excavation never alters his options or knowledge despite "raw hands." Orientation clear by para 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sewer/sunken city provides vivid decay imagery but postcard description fails to constrain choices; chronometer cog’s recurrence (handled twice) lacks mechanics shaping tactics. Final image’s "darkness receding" charges tone but isn’t anchored to physical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (competing narratives) remains abstract—no visible tightening as Kael’s thoughts never face concrete test. Pressure flattens when "silence was a balm," defusing tension without cost. Stakes declared but never dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "rationally rebellious spirit" and "comforting half-truths" in final paragraph state thesis outright, violating organic emergence. Theme ("humanity’s folly") floats without being reweighted by Kael’s actions; no non-literal answer in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (decay-focused, tactile objects) but register drifts into academic diction ("transience of human endeavor," "conceptual repricing") during high-pressure beats. Consistent single-POV though filter verbs ("Kael's eyes gleamed," "thoughts turned") dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loop in final third: "competing narratives that swirled in his head like a maelstrom" immediately followed by "jumble of competing narratives." Filter-verb stack (4+ lines) in high-pressure beat triggers -0.5 artifact penalty; "abrasive calm of Kael's intellect" muddles metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Familiar post-apocalyptic tropes (philosopher in ruins) lack fresh synthesis; chronometer cog as narrative key shows ingenuity but feels derivative of steampunk motifs. Avoids safety middle yet hedging on moral calculus—Kael’s "rebellion" lacks concrete stakes beyond intellectual posturing.</comment>
