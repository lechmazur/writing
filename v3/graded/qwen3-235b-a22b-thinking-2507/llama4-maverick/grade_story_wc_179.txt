<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism is stated but not demonstrated through meaningful choices; internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in action. "Diagnostic label-speak" ("cycle of suffering") undermines embodied emotion during pivotal healing scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No visible cost anchors closure; "forgotten" pin offers no sacrifice. Reality shift occurs magically without causal escalation under any lens. Earned Stasis fails as no path is foreclosed with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary atmosphere vivid but static; music box pin described without constraining choices. Final image ("beauty from brokenness") charges closure weakly through lyric reprise but lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("resentment"); no narrowing of options or earned reversal. Healing occurs via deus ex machina melody, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" rule. No visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Theme reduced to stated philosophy ("shifting grace"); final paragraph moralizes with "beauty that could emerge." Thematic Echo penalty triggered by prompt-like thesis in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV stable but voice lacks character-specific perceptual signature; abstract musings dominate over concrete noticing. Prose rhythm varies but philosophical digressions override Elara's plausible lexicon during stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("distant memory, silenced"; "reappear when needed") and template cadence ("her fingers tracing... she pondered...") dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy in high-pressure healing sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Derivative "broken object enables healing" trope; no fresh inflection beyond generic pacifism narrative. Relies on familiar archetypes without personalization; emotional resolution feels templated.</comment>
