<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "patchwork of lost opportunities" vs. writing resurgence, but "gleaned redemption" stated rather than embodied through micro-choices; emotional progression remains abstract in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure: "heart a little lighter" crystallizes stance with felt cost of isolation; music box's fade-to-write sequence tightens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (glass jars) constrains choice via memory-triggering action and charges final dunes image; "feral loft" specificity avoids white-room syndrome but some atmospheric details feel decorative rather than pressure-generating.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving beauty against forgetfulness) tightens through jar interactions, but cost of isolation remains implied rather than viscerally paid; deepening via writing resurgence lacks tangible tradeoff despite lyrical payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through jar/music box particulars with resonant final image ("dunes, their feral beauty"), but "lonesome splendor" repetition edges toward thematic echo without sufficient subtextual evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "light creeping like hesitant lover" and sound-focused diction; rhythmic control modulates perfectly with emotional shifts, though "positively wistful" briefly breaches POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "patchwork of lost opportunities/silence oppressive" creates adjacent paraphrase loop; final image retains clarity despite borderline figurative density in dawn descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-capturing method with generational translation, yet emotional arc follows predictable redemption template; specificity in "penny poet" and glass jars elevates beyond archetype but lacks transformative risk.</comment>
