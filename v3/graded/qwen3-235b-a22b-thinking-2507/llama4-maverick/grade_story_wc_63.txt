<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Diagnostic "incremental absolution" label replaces embodied conflict; internal contradiction lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in action. "Seering reverie" triggers -0.5 penalty for therapy-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (past burdens lifting), but "weight slowly lifting" abstracts price; orientation clear by para 1. Accumulative lens holds yet cost legibility weakens high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tidal ridge constrains choice as walking surface and charges final "threshold" image; rake handle inscriptions function as micro-setting. Generic "soothing hum" prevents 9.0 despite otherwise purposeful sensory selectivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant redemption stake tightens via rake handle discovery, narrowing options to walking forward. But cost remains abstract ("weight lifting") without visible forfeiture; escalation lacks tangible price under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pendulum/rake motifs reweighted in final image; avoids moralizing despite redemption arc. "Reborn" phrasing risks sentimentality but saved by concrete lunar light and obsidian ridge specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (clock mechanics, weathered textures) but rhythmic control falters in reflection blocks; filter verbs ("she felt") dull immediacy during pivotal discovery beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "stillness give way to motion" echoed later as "stillness give way to purpose". Consistent voice but "searing reverie" is mixed metaphor; final image retains clarity despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-winding profession with redemption trope; obsidian ridge specificity avoids generic "rocky shore". Derivative "reborn" phrasing caps high-band potential despite strong emotional truth.</comment>
