<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear (ghost-seeing purpose) but interior contradiction underdeveloped; "weightless burden" concept lacks visceral cost escalation despite solid embodied details like dust analysis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works (accepting stories' burden), but causality stumbles: logbook discovery feels coincidental, not earned by dust analysis; fluorescent buzz anchor saves early orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Circus ticket office vividly realized through sensory specifics (faded posters, skeletal lights), though micro-setting (mainspring barrel) enriches atmosphere more than constraining choices during key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) signaled early, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation; ghosts' intensification feels atmospheric rather than raising stakes with tangible cost beyond emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden stories emerges organically through dust/logbook discovery; final image ("weightless burden... stories yet to discover") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("skillfully observant nature drinking in details"), but minor filter-verb clusters ("Ezra's eyes scan," "gaze drifts") slightly blunt immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("skeletal fingers," "faint trail"), but adjacent template cadences ("Ezra's eyes scan... Ezra's gaze drifts...") trigger mild scaffold penalty in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-seer trope with horologist object elevates premise; avoids derivative safety via concrete dust-analysis method and weightless-burden emotional specificity.</comment>
