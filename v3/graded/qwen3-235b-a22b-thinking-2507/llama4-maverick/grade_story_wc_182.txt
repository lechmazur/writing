<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("prove herself") remains abstract without contradictory impulses; epiphany about "applying knowledge" emerges abruptly without embodied struggle during crisis, violating emotional progression rules.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof: pursuers vanish when door closes with no consequence, and "weight lifting" is abstract. Renegotiation lacks visible trade-off, breaking causal linkage at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Impossible geometries" of bookstore never constrain choices—navigation is effortless. Fails 9+ gate as setting doesn't charge closure; "unheard symphony" cliché replaces concrete environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stakes evaporate at climax: shadowy figures pose no lasting cost after library discovery. Botanical diary retrieval requires zero effort ("nestled between pages"), violating "dramatized consequence" requirement for declared stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Explicit moralizing ("found something far more valuable than mere knowledge") in final paragraph triggers Thematic Echo penalty; theme arises from abstract assertion, not earned struggle with "unlearned lessons."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>POV leaks omniscient observations ("the very fabric of reality resonating") impossible for Elara to perceive. Time traveler's introduction uses "revealing a time traveler"—knowledge breach violating focalization rules.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Closure beat crippled by figurative muddle: "unheard symphony" repeated 3x with escalating vagueness. "Silence almost palpable" cliché and paraphrase loops ("new path... new purpose... new world") dull final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Derivative premise (Borges-esque library + time-travel trope) lacks transformation; "labyrinthine bookstore" functions as generic magic-realm placeholder without specific lived-in detail or fresh moral calculus.</comment>
