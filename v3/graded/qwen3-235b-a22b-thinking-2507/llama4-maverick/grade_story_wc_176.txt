<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (fingers moving deftly, aurora's hiss weaving consciousness) but reflection on self-forgiveness lacks micro-choice integration; "snowmelt ardor" feels like diagnostic label-speak in peak beats without embodied cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with aurora celebrating preserved memories, but cost of self-forgiveness remains abstract—stated in reflection rather than dramatized with visible on-page consequence during the rope plucking climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora create vivid atmosphere, yet environment never constrains choices or charges final image; "snowmelt ardor" is ornamental rather than functional, failing 9+ gate requiring setting to alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving forgotten names) tighten through rope reconfiguration, but cost remains emotional/abstract; Akira's self-forgiveness isn't dramatized with visible trade-off during the pivotal plucking moment, weakening escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rope-and-card mechanics, but "snowmelt ardor" undermines resonance by stating rather than embodying the cost; final aurora celebration reweights prior material without moralizing, yet lacks conceptual depth for 8.5+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (candlelight on features, aurora's "hiss and crackle") with rhythmic control, though "snowmelt ardor" introduces register drift into vague abstraction during high-pressure climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No scaffold loops or syntax monotony, but "snowmelt ardor" creates figurative muddle in closure beat—snowmelt implies thawing while ardor denotes passion, diluting the final image's emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lost wax casting with sound preservation, yet "snowmelt ardor" feels like safety-middle abstraction; emotional specificity in memory work elevates, but self-forgiveness angle lacks transformative detail for 8.5+.</comment>
