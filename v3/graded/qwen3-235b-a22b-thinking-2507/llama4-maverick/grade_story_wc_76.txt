<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("step beyond fate's design") lacks internal conflict; no hesitation or cost when touching the hunger stone. "Neatly inventive mind" repeats as label without embodied contradiction during high-stakes puzzle-solving. Final change ("never be the same") remains abstract, missing concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly but closure lacks legible cost: radiance fades yet no specific sacrifice shown (e.g., "bleak exhilaration" contradicts hopeful transformation). Yoyo resolution summarized ("puzzle finally yielded") without dramatized struggle, undermining escalation. Orientation clear by 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting charges closure: shifts from "bleak foreboding" to "beacon of hope" via stone's glow. Tide ("slow exhale") anchors timing but doesn't constrain choices. Salt/seaweed scent and "crumbling walls" vividly filter through clock maker's obsessions without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover secrets) tightens when hunger stone demands yoyo puzzle, but escalation lacks cost: reverse-engineering described as "painstaking" yet no failed attempts shown. Final radiance glow alters options (lighthouse transformed) but "fading" offers no felt consequence for the protagonist's choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "latent radiance" emerges through hunger stone's glow reconfiguring lighthouse's meaning, avoiding direct statement. But "bleak exhilaration" contradicts hopeful ending, muddling the cost. Final image ("vast expanse of possibility") states optimism rather than reweighting hunger stone's "unfulfilled longing" symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature: clock maker notices "cryptic symbols" and "intricate carvings" as puzzles. Rhythmic control falters in climax with therapy-speak ("bleak exhilaration"). No POV slippage, but tense consistency wavers during yoyo descent ("navigated" vs. "began").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("rocky shores," "musty bowels") but "neatly inventive mind" repeats as scaffold. Final paragraph overwrites with abstract resolution ("vast expanse of possibility"). Filter-verb stack in puzzle scene ("felt," "knew," "began") dulls immediacy despite high-pressure context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-making precision with mystical hunger stone, but "latent radiance" trope remains underdeveloped. Bold structural risk in lyrical closure, yet "bleak exhilaration" feels unearned—lighthouse transforms to hope without cost, contradicting the stone's established symbolism of longing.</comment>
