<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("certify wonder," "oscillating repose") without contradictory impulses; synesthesia described but never constrains action under pressure; emotional progression feels tidily resolved without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("memory of the experience lingered"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) weakens escalation; "sculpted hush" unfettering lacks specific forfeiture beyond sheet wear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ice cavern’s crystalline structures and amber sheet create vivid atmosphere, but setting functions as backdrop—no constraint on choices; aurora colors "seep" passively without altering tactics or charging final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("certify wonder") remains abstractly declared; no meaningful tightening—chisel strike resolves conflict coincidentally without protagonist agency or visible trade-off; cost feels conceptual but not legible in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("certify wonder as essential") moralizes directly; "sculpted hush" concept drifts into vague platitudes without earned resonance through concrete action; undermines organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice maintains consistent texture, but syntactic monotony ("As... As... Through...") flattens emotional peaks; synesthetic perception lacks character-specific bias, reading like generic mystical description under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Severe overwriting in climax: 82% of sentences deploy stacked modifiers ("soft, harmonious hum," "ethereal light," "kaleidoscope of colors"); filter-verb stack ("sought to certify," "aimed to unfetter") dulls immediacy in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Derivative spiritual-artistic trope ("unfettering silence"); ice cavern/aurora imagery feels recycled; specificity lacks transformative detail—swap "prism-song" for "temple chant" with minimal edits, failing proximity check.</comment>
