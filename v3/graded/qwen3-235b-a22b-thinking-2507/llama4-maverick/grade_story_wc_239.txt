<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "wanderingly exact" trait is label-only without visible tradeoffs during pressure. No micro-choices under stress—Aria's actions feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost as Aria unifies cosmic fragments, but cost isn't pinpointable on-page; "fragments of her own being" implies transformation without showing its felt weight in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Temple library anchors early with vivid parchment scent and sentinel shelves, but functions as passive backdrop; only the dictionary (micro-setting) charges closure by becoming a "sentinel" guarding secrets after her journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (unraveling cosmic illusions) tighten texturally through deepening silence and sensory shifts, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—the universe's hiccup resolves via coincidence, not Aria's choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "spiral arbitration" as lived experience, not moralizing; final image ("footsteps echoed... stillness, movement") reweights cosmic harmony without stating a moral, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Poetic rhythm falters under pressure: elevated diction ("delving deep into recesses of her own soul") persists during high-stakes moments without compression, and filter verbs ("seemed to dance") dull immediacy despite lyrical texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Synonym churn ("timeless bounds"/"timeless and fleeting," "distortions cleared"/"distortions that had clouded reality") and template cadence ("As she [verb], [effect]") in climax create momentum drag; weak nominalizations ("a testament to") obscure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"End of history witness" trope transformed via dictionary-as-cosmic-lexicon, but "spiral arbitration" remains abstractly named without tangible mechanics; temple rediscovery payoff feels fresh yet lacks bold structural risk.</comment>
