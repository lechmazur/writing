<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Motivation clear (curiosity driving discovery); micro-choices in pattern-deciphering reveal values. Weakness: "Diligently curious" remains label-only without contradictory impulses; internal conflict underdeveloped despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (Eli ready to sail into unknown) with felt cost in "sociable isolation" contrasted against crew's exhaustion. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern-density buildup to crystallized decision point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hopscotch board functions as micro-setting that directly constrains choice (decoding patterns) and charges final image ("starlings seemed to be watching"). Airship details feel lived-in through tactile interactions like dog-ear handling and chart-scratching.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake (deciphering luminance) tightens through Eli's agency in noting patterns, but cost remains abstract. Crew's return creates subtle pressure shift, yet escalation lacks tangible trade-off beyond emotional isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (maps, luminance), but "sociable isolation" phrasing risks thematic echo. Final image reweights discovery's cost through starlings' watchful presence, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in map-focused observations ("scuff marks aligned with stars"). Rhythmic control during decoding sequence; minor register drift in "diligently curious nature kicked in" slightly undermines immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; "dog-ear on page 37 fluttering" shows textural specificity. Slight overwriting in "whispers weaving in and out of creaks and groans" dilutes momentum near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic obsession with luminous mystery. Airship-as-world metaphor avoids cliché through hopscotch code mechanics, though starling motif feels derivative without deeper transformation.</comment>
