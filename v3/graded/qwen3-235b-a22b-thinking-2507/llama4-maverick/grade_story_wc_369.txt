<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on diagnostic labels ("sorrow was quantifiable") rather than embodied contradiction; no micro-choices under pressure during sextant repair. Final endurance lacks visible cost escalation, failing 9+ test for earned causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with legible cost (sorrow dissipation → mundane miracles), but lens ambiguity past midpoint (-0.3) caps high-band eligibility. Storm/moon pattern break reweights stakes cleanly under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlit tower anchors sensory urgency early, but sextant (micro-setting) only charges final image without constraining mid-scene choices. "Damp stone and ozone" exemplifies purposeful specificity that elevates beyond atmospheric cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantifying sorrow) remains abstract despite premise; no visible price paid during deconstruction (e.g., worker's exhaustion). Storm intensification lacks causal pressure on tactics, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("ordinary and extraordinary intertwined") undermines earned resonance, though "mundane miracles" reweights prior sorrow through concrete lunar light imagery. Avoids overt moralizing but overstates conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature falters during storm climax ("lightning flashing in time with heartbeat" reads generic), though rhythmic control in moonlight sequences shows voice modulation. No dialogue present to test subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Template cadence loops ("As they...") in final third dull closure momentum, but strategic telling compresses backstory cleanly. "Heart was full of purpose" exemplifies scaffold phrasing that slightly obscures emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "quantified sorrow" with mundane miracles avoids trope safety, though stormlit tower leans cliché. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing (sorrow as force) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
