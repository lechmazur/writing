<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (urgency vs tranquility) but "dry-witted" trait remains label-only; phrasebook connection lacks causal weight in key decisions despite being her "mantra." No visible cost in final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong orientation anchors outpost/lake by 120 words; closure achieves Charged Poise with crystallized options on the ice. But cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page (no tangible forfeiture or altered tactics).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen lake functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (ice creaking beneath feet), but "rusted outpost" details stay ornamental; decay/smoke scents don't constrain choices despite vivid sensory selection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding convergence) tightens via condensation pattern discovery, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; urgency stems from lore ("falcon returns"), not Emilia's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "world remade" resonates through river/convergence motifs, but final paragraph moralizing ("world full of wonder...") triggers -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (atlas editor noticing patterns) and rhythmic control shine, but "worrying tranquility" phrasing repeats verbatim, dulling tension modulation during critical ice-crossing beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Snow crunched beneath her feet" paraphrase loop (3x identical phrasing) triggers -0.4; "worrying tranquility" label in high-pressure beat adds -0.3. Final image lacks textural specificity for peak momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geographical quest with lyrical atmosphere, but "singular convergence" premise relies on familiar mystical-anomaly tropes without transformative specificity in stakes or closure.</comment>
