<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "raw solace" amid grief; embodied emotion through censer foot handling. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "geography of loss" phrasing lacking concrete micro-choice during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "never be the same" with visible cost on the empty plain. Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchored in first 30 words. No flaws in causality or cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Patina bronze censer foot functions as essential micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. Starlit station actively pressures navigation but hydraulics failure lacks concrete tactical impact beyond backstory setup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through moon-phase constraints and phone call mechanics, forcing crystallization at the empty plain. Agency clear despite external calls; cost legible in "never restore what was lost." One decisive deepening sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from fragments motif without moralizing. Final image reweights loss through "build a new life on fragments," avoiding sentimentality while offering resonant non-literal answer to grief's central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("canvas of shadows," "raw solace") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful repetition of "fragments" taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; compression serves accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with concrete specificity ("worn smooth by time"). Minor paraphrase loop on "raw solace" (appears twice) and slightly generic "possibility and promise" in final line prevent 9.0. Zero scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief metaphor with navigation tropes; "reverse migration" transforms journey narrative through specific mechanics (moon phases, censer foot). Emotional truth avoids abstraction via verifiable details like patina bronze handling.</comment>
