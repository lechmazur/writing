<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; mystic's flawless conviction shows no struggle or flaw, reducing her to a vessel for theme. "Truthful lies" concept remains abstract assertion without micro-choices revealing value hierarchies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>No discernible drive lens: "shifted hush" and "truthful lies" are reiterated concepts, not causal/accumulative pressure. Critical failure—closure declares transformation ("change her life forever") with zero dramatized cost or altered stance; "truth" remains untested assertion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (damp earth, frost patterns) anchor setting early but fail the 9+ gate: quartz arbor/prism don't constrain choices—they're ornamental backdrop. Car window frost could be replaced with any surface without altering the "communion" mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("prove objects absorb emotions") remain abstract and untested; no tightening of options or dramatized cost. Pressure evaporates as mist "clears" without consequence—escalation relies on thematic repetition ("truthful lies") rather than protagonist agency or narrowed choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "truthful lies" and "profound truth" are declared rather than earned through particulars. Final paragraph moralizes ("simple and profound truth") with explicit lesson-stating, violating organic emergence and triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV leaks omnisciently ("she was convinced," "mystic believed") breaking deep immersion. Voice modulates rhythm well but "collective unconscious" and "resonant reconfiguration" phrasing violates mystic's plausible lexicon, inserting academic jargon where embodied perception should reign.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong lyrical rhythm but "truthful lies" repetition creates synonym churn (3x in final third). Fatal simultaneity error: "felt the mist begin to clear" clashes with "mist swirled around her" in same beat, obscuring cause/effect and dulling closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Quartz arbor/frost-on-car-window offers slight trope transformation, but mystic's flawless epiphany feels derivative of spiritual clichés. Emotional progression lacks specificity—no fresh inflection beyond "mystic sees truth," failing the transformation test for universality.</comment>
