<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to interpret silence as possibility" stated not earned; lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority relies on thematic labels ("quietly persistent") without embodied struggle during pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Accumulative/Textural Charged Poise fails cost legibility: "newfound purpose" lacks visible sacrifice. Wind bells' return charges final image but no felt price anchors the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Halo fragment charges final image as micro-setting; mist-shrouded carriages constrain movement. Wind bells evolve with emotional shifts but "abandoned circus train" remains postcard backdrop without tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpreting silence) never faces concrete test; "wrong turn" coincidence complicates but no cost alters tactics. Singing resolves without carpenter agency—singer vanishes then reappears conveniently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Hidden truth... would stay with them forever" is explicit moralizing in final paragraph. Theme stated directly ("interpret silence as possibility") rather than emerging from concrete struggle; no earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mist-shrouded carriages" and "whispering gleam" filters all details. Voice modulates effectively from "soft chime" to "haunting melody" but "misting hush" repetition risks template cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("rusty wheels," "faded paint") but paraphrase loops: "misting hush" appears 5x with near-identical phrasing. Filter verbs ("seemed to carry," "realized they had") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Circus train + silence premise feels derivative; "hidden oasis" trope lacks transformation. Wind bells motif shows ingenuity but "halo fragment" leans on mystical convenience without world logic constraints.</comment>
