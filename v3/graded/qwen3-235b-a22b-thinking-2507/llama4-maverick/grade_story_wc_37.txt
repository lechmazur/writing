<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but unconflicted; no contradictory impulses during pivotal humming scene. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("sense of hope") without embodied struggle or cost during the realm-shifting act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: realm "begins to heal" with no visible sacrifice. "Renewed determination" lacks legible price under Accumulative lens; Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure, but darkness recedes without consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (luminescent fungi, mica refractions) anchor setting early, but environment never constrains choices. Greenhouse remains postcard backdrop; no tool/body/object charges closure despite lyrical descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes declared ("dying realm") but pressure never tightens—humming immediately causes positive change. No complication or cost during escalation; plants bloom "in time with rhythm" without resistance, violating Accumulative lens requirement for reweighted stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "woven dawns" metaphor but final paragraph states resolution ("realm began to flourish") rather than resonant image. Avoids moralizing yet lacks the non-literal reweighting required for high-band thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in botanical observations, but uniform tics ("soft, gentle vibrations") flatten voice under pressure. Free indirect style consistent, yet rhythmic control weakens during climax with repetitive "woven dawns" refrains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate climax: "weaving threads of woven dawns... swaddle of sound... woven dawns hallmark" in three consecutive lines. Filter-verb stacks ("felt drawn," "began to hum") dull immediacy in high-pressure beat, disqualifying 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tropes (chosen-one archetype, magic-through-song) lack transformation—swap "memory keeper" for "shaman" and plot functions identically. Emotional specificity absent; "rekindle dying realm" feels generic without unique moral calculus.</comment>
