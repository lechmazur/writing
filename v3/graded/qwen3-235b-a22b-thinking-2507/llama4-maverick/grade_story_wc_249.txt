<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("auroral sorrow") without sufficient embodied contradiction; motivation for shared dream stated but not dramatized with visceral trade-offs under pressure. Quiet rebellion shown only late via drumming escalation, lacking earlier micro-choices that reveal flawed hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("fragile entangled memories," "vulnerable to time") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by 100 words; pressure deepens via drumming cadence shift that narrows options to fleeting connection, though escalation lacks a decisive intensification beat beyond rhythmic crescendo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains choice (drumming on metallic surfaces, perch edge) and charges final image ("vibrations echoing through her being"). Sensory details vivid but over-rely on visual glow; micro-setting (auric lagoon's response to sound waves) meaningfully alters tactics by intensifying drumming, though spatial choreography of "vortex" lacks tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving fragile memory connection) signaled early and deepens through drumming escalation, but cost remains conceptual ("fleeting moment") without visible price paid on-page during pressure rise. Agency-driven intensification works under Accumulative lens, though auroral sorrow's bittersweetness lacks concrete trade-off beyond emotional abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory fragility emerges through auric lagoon's dimming light and "vulnerable" dream, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("vibrations would remain... auroral sorrow and beauty") offers resonant non-literal answer, but "entangled memories" concept stays abstract without concrete manifestation in stakes, risking thematic shallowness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic sound/light descriptions ("petal-like structures resonated," "symphony of sound and light") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from stillness to vortex intensity, though "hush of universe" conceit slightly overreaches conceptual clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("diamond" stars, "metallic surface") but paraphrase loops in emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow" repeated without deepening embodiment; "bittersweet feeling" abstracts state). Final image avoids muddle, though "fleeting moment" phrasing risks scaffold in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-memory motif within sci-fi lyricism, with auric lagoon's light response to drumming offering non-obvious emotional calculus. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, though "experimental guinea pig" framing remains underutilized trope without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
