<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interior conflict shown through alternating summaries ("disdain and fascination" then "desire to interrupt destiny") rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses. "Stoically sensitive" trait is label-only without embodied demonstration during peak pressure, triggering diagnostic penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is valid Charged Poise (new creation crystallizes options) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost proof fails: "trepidation" lacks legible felt/conceptual price. Orientation clear early, but lens ambiguity at climax ("penny drops" vs transformation) caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere but ember nexus remains decorative postcard; no environment/tool constrains choices or charges final image. Micro-setting potential in crozier fragments squandered—they're handled passively without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking stifling destiny) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "principles of creative destruction" dictate actions rather than choices under pressure. Cost remains abstract despite "trepidation," failing legibility requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crozier's rebirth but "creative destruction" stays abstract concept rather than integrated into tactics. Ending offers thematic resonance ("ruins of old world") but lacks non-literal answer to central question required for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical voice falters under pressure: "vibrate with energy... awakening long-dormant power" violates POV plausibility. "Stoically sensitive" description ("rock against turbulent forces") uses stock metaphor, weakening perceptual signature during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("As the energy reached... pushed to limit... remained steadfast") and redundant phrasing ("dance of creation and destruction that seemed to capture essence"). Final third artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility despite strong opening rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alchemical framing transforms "creative destruction" trope, but bishop's crozier feels symbolic convenience rather than organic. "Frozen bloom" twilight motif lacks evolution—present early/late without meaningful transformation, reducing freshness.</comment>
