<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract; no visible internal conflict or stakes-driven choices. "Cellar of reason" desire told not dramatized with friction. Contradictory impulses absent despite prolonged effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks felt cost; "weight of discoveries" too vague. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but causality thin—device reactivation feels unearned after passive observation. No orientation penalty applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cavern setting vividly realized with sensory specificity; crystals function as micro-setting charging closure image. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn’t constrain choices (e.g., no tool limitations or spatial pressures during repair).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("harvest of echoes") remain abstract; no concrete pressure or trade-offs. "Wounded season" lull adds atmosphere but no tightening of options. Agency passive—study replaces meaningful choice with observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "echoes" motif but final paragraph states moral ("magic beyond perception"). Avoids sentimentality yet lacks complexity; no counter-readings or earned ambiguity in resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in crystal-light observations, but syntactic monotony in reflective passages ("Elian's..."). Overuse of filter verbs ("gaze took in," "thoughts turned") dulls immediacy despite lyrical control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity but scaffold loops: "soft glow" (crystals/device), "peripherally focused gaze" repeated. Near-closure metaphor ("thrill of excitement") slightly overwrought yet legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh "harvest of echoes" concept grounded in locksmith’s craft, but emotional arc generic (curiosity → satisfaction). Avoids tropes yet lacks risk-taking; resolution safe and unsurprising despite lyrical execution.</comment>
