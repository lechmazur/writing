<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") shown via cloth clutching and note-making micro-choices, but "echo valley longing" is diagnostic label-speak triggering Q1 penalty; final resolve lacks visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly (accepting dual identity with cloth as catalyst), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds with quarry twilight deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quarry setting functions as micro-setting: stone walls echo concerts while constraining Jack's movement to trailer, charging final image where darkness becomes "symphony of possibilities" through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling past/present selves) signaled early, but escalation lacks narrowing options; phone call introduces mild pressure yet resolves without trade-off, leaving stakes abstract despite golden-light longing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cloth scrap's reweighted meaning (memento→catalyst), avoiding moralizing; but "echo valley longing" repetition borders on thematic echo, diluting resonance in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rock dust," "coarse fabric") persists under stress; free indirect style ("he was confidently uncertain") cleanly modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but "confidently uncertain" label appears twice as scaffold; final paragraph's "symphony of possibilities" edges toward overwriting yet avoids muddle through concrete star imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie/appraiser duality feels inevitable; quarry-as-concert-venue transforms cliché, though "echo valley longing" phrasing lacks specificity to avoid derivative resonance.</comment>
