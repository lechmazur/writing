<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but abstract ("discover beauty in incomplete") lacks concrete stakes; micro-choices like clutching feather show no tactical shift or cost. Feather observation passive rather than driving decisions, missing contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: snapped kite string introduces disruption but no legible price paid ("world was new, fresh" avoids cost). Charged Poise attempt undermined by absence of felt consequence for her "incomplete beauty" pursuit at pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon functions as active micro-setting: wet sand shapes footprints, mist responds to her voice, water lapping charges final heartbeat rhythm. Environment concretely constrains choices (shoreline composition) and charges closure image without static postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover beauty in incomplete") never faces concrete test; snapped kite string is passive coincidence, not protagonist-driven escalation. Zero pressure buildup under Accumulative lens—disruption doesn't narrow options or alter tactics, leaving stakes abstract and unresolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thematic Echo in final paragraph ("world was full of beauty") states thesis explicitly, violating organic emergence rule. "Woven dawns" motif lacks causal pressure—symbolic feather return feels unearned as it never constrained choices or charged cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in sensory details (iridescent feather sheen, water's melody) but filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Rhythmic control strong yet repetitive "burnished hush" phrasing creates scaffold loops near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Verbatim repetition of "soothing melody" and paraphrase loops ("gentle lapping... rhythm of her heart") in closure beat trigger -0.7 penalty. Elevated diction ("shrill twang piercing air") clashes with meditative voice during pivotal kite snap, muddling pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Trope transformation via specific sensory anchors (drake's feather, cobalt lagoon) avoids generic "inspired poet" clichés. However, risk-taking remains safe—feather's transience symbolism follows predictable lyric pattern without bold reconfiguration of stakes.</comment>
