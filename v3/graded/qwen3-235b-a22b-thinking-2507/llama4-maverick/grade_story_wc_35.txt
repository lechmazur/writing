<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation lacks concrete stakes; "sandpaper rough memories" remains abstract despite poetic phrasing. No on-page demonstration of her culinary healing or interaction with others undermines credibility. Interior contradiction feels underdeveloped beyond generalized "turmoil." Final endurance lacks visible cost scaling to desert setting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: Elara's endurance at the pavilion forecloses path with visceral cost ("memories swirling within her"). Orientation delayed past 120 words (no who/where anchor until sensory details), but disorientation pays off in tidal pool revelation. Accumulative lens holds through memory density buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert fortress walls and tidal pool function as micro-setting: damp sandstone enables memory transmission via touch, tidal pool reflections charge the climax. Sensory details filter through chef's palate ("wet earth and ozone"). Final image of "resolute fortress" recharges earlier damp walls with earned resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("remorse" unspecified); no concrete cost scales to desert setting until climax. Pressure coheres through memory accumulation, but tidal pool analysis feels disconnected from core conflict. Pavilion climax delivers meaningful tightening: cold air/darkness narrow options as memories threaten to overwhelm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; "sandpapering" metaphor evolves from jagged to smoothed edges without stated moral. Final image reweights premise: remorse persists but loses pain through action, not epiphany. Lacks complexity—resolution feels too neat for profound sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flavors of the past danced on her palate") reflects chef POV. "Sturdy brittle" tone modulates perfectly under pressure at pavilion climax. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via tidal pool analysis. Rhythmic control shines in sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "damp from recent rain" repeats verbatim. Otherwise exemplary propulsion—tidal pool sequence weaves action/perception ("fingers brushed against the sand"). Final line avoids cliché by tying "resilience" to concrete fortress imagery. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transforms memory-tasting trope via desert/ocean paradox (coral pavilion beneath dunes). "Sturdy brittle" inflection feels inevitable for chef handling emotional textures. Risks quiet closure but avoids safety middle. Slightly derivative in remorse-healing premise without deeper moral ambiguity.</comment>
