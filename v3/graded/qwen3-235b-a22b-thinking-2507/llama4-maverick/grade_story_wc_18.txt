<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("capture runaway dream") but lacks genuine struggle; "firmly grounded" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs during mirror-making climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with vanishing act and sextant testament, but orientation test fails: "centuries of thick fog" creates temporal confusion unserved by closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog and frost actively constrain choices (breathing rhythm, sextant discovery) and charge the final image; ruined orchard supplies essential object with tarnished brass reflecting decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing dream) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; sextant discovery provides no actual pressure test, rendering cost (vanishing) unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sextant rebirth and fog’s breath-holding, but "testament to the power of erasing boundaries" in final paragraph triggers thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("morbid perfume," frost’s "ethereal glow") modulates with emotional intensity; minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in opening beats ("As twilight approached... Upon this shimmer... As she held") triggers paraphrase-loop penalty; final image clarity prevents deeper deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-making and astronomy tropes through sextant’s spiritual wholeness, but "glass mountains" concept lacks sufficient transformation from familiar dream imagery.</comment>
