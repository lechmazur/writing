<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels like "empirically intuitive" without embodied contradiction; final choice lacks visible cost as fulfillment feels unearned despite emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost in tears and transformed cavern, but causality falters—creek rising never pressures decisions, and ant-following feels coincidental rather than agency-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Blooming cavern described vividly yet functions as backdrop, not constraint; type foundry chip (micro-setting) charges closure by unlocking the note, but environmental pressure on choices remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("lingering promise") signaled early but never viscerally tested—creek's threat evaporates without tactical consequence, and no trade-off narrows options during cavern trials.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of legacy resolved through explicit moralizing ("promise fulfilled," "father's legacy lived on") rather than earned ambiguity; final paragraph's tidy connection undermines complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV consistent but voice lacks distinct texture—"dusty relics" clichés and uniform rhythm under stress dilute perceptual signature; filter verbs ("Emilia felt") dull immediacy during key discoveries.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in repetitive "glimmer" imagery and stock phrases ("tears of joy and sadness"); no critical loops, but overwriting in cavern description slows momentum without deepening pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Derivative quest tropes (ants as guides, magical cavern) lack fresh synthesis; emotional safety-middle avoids bold stakes—Emilia's map expertise never shapes unique problem-solving or moral calculus.</comment>
