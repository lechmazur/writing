<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("cosmic verse," "obsidian grace") without contradictory impulses; exile motivation clear but final choice lacks visible struggle or cost—verse creation feels inevitable rather than earned through tangible trade-offs. Diagnostic phrasing like "narrative weight of nostalgia ban" undermines authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise (verse etched, exile lifting) under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost remains abstract—no on-page moment where nostalgia ban's price manifests concretely during the dance. Pressure deepens via sensory density yet lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Twilight garden's sensory richness (night flowers, ocean sounds) anchors atmosphere vividly, but setting never constrains choices—stone edge and moonstone are observed, not interacted with to alter tactics. Final verse image lacks environmental charge, relying on stated significance rather than spatial consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (penning cosmic verse) is signaled early but pressure stagnates; "fledging" presents as spontaneous inevitability, not a contested choice with escalating cost. No visible price paid during the dance—physical strain, fear of failure, or ban repercussions remain untested, leaving stakes abstract despite poetic framing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of art transcending time emerges through cosmic verse imagery, but final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("power of art to transcend"), violating organic resonance. Nostalgia ban concept remains thematic backdrop rather than driving concrete friction, weakening the central question's payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice shines with "obsidian grace" and sensory specificity, maintaining perceptual signature under pressure. Minor tense slippage ("hand became anchored" vs. present-dance descriptions) and academic diction ("elective exile") slightly disrupt focalization consistency in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overwriting undermines propulsion: scaffold loops ("serene and isolated haven" echoed as "sacred space"), filter-verb stacks ("Aria felt... knew... began"), and mixed metaphor ("stars faded but light remained"). Final paragraph's redundant awe ("wonder and awe... peace... wonder") dulls closure momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in "cosmic verse on mortal skin" elevates familiar mystical tropes, but nostalgia ban premise lacks non-obvious angle—exile's emotional logic feels derivative. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, yet core struggle avoids bold specificity in favor of poetic generality.</comment>
