<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("map of emotions," "joyful sorrow") without embodied contradiction; motivation clear but lacks micro-choices under pressure during pivotal signing scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (transformed harbor) lands with conceptual cost, but the "fragility of memory" stakes lack visceral legibility at crescendo where cost should anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid harbor atmosphere fails the 9+ gate—moonlight and camera never constrain choices; camera’s "no film" detail is ornamental despite poetic final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("translate silence into music") remain abstract; no tangible tightening—disruption of tranquility lacks opposition or trade-offs, rendering escalation purely atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through camera/sign language, but "beauty in forgetfulness" edges toward thematic echo in final paragraphs without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with rhythmic control, though "joyful sorrow" abstraction slightly dulls immediacy; sign language rendered with subtextual precision elevates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong density and cadence, but "map of emotions" abstraction in peak signing scene introduces minor scaffold; final image rescues closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh silence/music synthesis lacks concrete stakes—emotional truth diluted by generic "luminous harbor" tropes despite specific camera detail.</comment>
