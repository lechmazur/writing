<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; epiphany ("uncovered hidden truth") feels unearned without visible struggle. "Tinkersong curiosity" and "articulate unspoken needs" read as diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, triggering anti-pattern penalties.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise ("courtyard forever changed") under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page. No exact sentence shows tangible sacrifice, failing cost proof test despite atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("scent of wet stone and ozone") anchors setting early, but courtyard functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choices. Flower press bolt plate appears static; environment never pressures tactics despite storm escalation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes ("communicate with entity") deepen through sensory density, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. No narrowing of options or trade-offs—balladeer's actions flow unimpeded toward resolution, missing band guardrail for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of "articulating unspoken needs" resolves into tidy moralizing ("uncovered hidden truth about herself") in penultimate paragraph, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Lacks meaningful ambiguity or competing goods in peak choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" and "driftingly alert" feel like forced neologisms disrupting POV plausibility. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias—any observer could note "tendrils of fog curl around statues" without revealing balladeer's unique lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("subtle ridges of engravings") but suffers paraphrase loops: "swirling mist" repeats identically across beats. Template cadence ("As she sat... As she worked...") in high-pressure scene triggers -0.4 penalty without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ghost in code" with graffiti art avoids cliché, but emotional resolution stays safe. No bold risk-taking—balladeer's journey lacks genuine struggle, hedging with mystical vagueness instead of confronting concrete cost.</comment>
