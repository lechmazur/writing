<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "thawing heart" metaphor replaces embodied conflict. Epiphany feels unearned as Elian transitions smoothly from "protective shell of ice" to purpose without struggle. No visible trade-offs when abandoning the familiar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—dripping water "reminder" feels decorative, not consequential. Accumulative lens holds, but "daunting prospect" resolves without felt sacrifice. Missing cost proof per Q2 gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned control room constrains choice through cracked panes and damp decay, charging the final orb's light. "Weighty lightness" motif evolves from description to thematic anchor. Micro-setting (furnace/orb) directly shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("craft safe zones") remain abstract; no on-page cost for abandoning the familiar. Escalation relies on internal shift ("thawing heart") without external pressure. Tightening feels unearned as Elian faces no tangible obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme collapses into final-paragraph moralizing: "Elian knew they had found their true calling." Thematic echo ("thawing heart") is reiterated, not reweighted. Wisdom feels platitudinal, not earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice has distinct textural rhythm ("soft clink... gentle hum"), but stress flattens perception—no degradation under pressure. Perceptual signature shines in glassblowing details, yet "soulful brown" eyes revert to stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repetitive stems ("Elian's thoughts turned...") and filter-verb stacks ("Elian knew... felt... smiled") dull immediacy. "Morbid perfume... damp shroud" mixes metaphors. Final paragraph's lyrical cadence compensates but can't offset scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transforms glassblowing into thematic vehicle, but "thawing heart" trope lacks fresh inflection. Avoids safety middle via poetic risk, yet emotional specificity feels generic—Elian's journey mirrors ubiquitous rebirth arcs without unique stakes.</comment>
