<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "quietly driven" trait remains label-only without testing through trade-offs. Final choice to proceed lacks visible internal struggle despite dread, missing Earned Stasis cost. No embodied contradiction beyond stated unease.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with "watchers watched" crystallizing options, but cost remains abstract ("weight settling") without specific on-page manifestation. Accumulative lens holds through dread accumulation, yet crack-triggered map discovery feels passive rather than causally earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shell patterns function as micro-setting that charges the closure image ("sunwashed dread"), but turtle-city backdrop remains decorative. Environment fails to constrain choices—Lyra navigates freely without terrain affecting tactics, missing 9+ gate for setting-driven closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via map’s "terrible fate" message, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the crack happens *to* Lyra, not *because* of her choices. Dread intensifies without tangible cost or narrowed options; "weight" remains conceptual rather than altering her journey’s execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of obsession vs. danger emerges through concrete actions (deciphering shells, blowing whistle), with final image reweighting "sunwashed dread" as haunting cost. Avoids moralizing but slightly overstates resonance with verbatim phrase repetition at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-focused noticing ("shell-scarred landmark"), with rhythmic compression during crack scene. Consistent third-person intimacy; "sunwashed dread" recurrence deepens texture without scaffold. No POV drift despite high tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("Lyra felt... Lyra felt") in final paragraphs dull immediacy. "Weight of her quest settling" is cliché, but closure image ("haunting, sunwashed dread") avoids figurative muddle. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh turtle-city premise transformed by "sunwashed dread" motif, but watcher trope lacks non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional specificity in Lyra’s quiet determination elevates it, yet risks feel familiar rather than boldly reconfigured.</comment>
