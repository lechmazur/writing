<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "legacy's burden" stated but not earned through micro-choices under pressure. Final "sense of peace" feels unearned as no tangible cost or trade-off is dramatized, reducing motivation to poetic abstraction rather than concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "sense of peace" and "work would be part of the estate’s legacy" lack visible or conceptual price. Lens (Accumulative) holds, but Earned Stasis isn’t charged—no foreclosed path or altered tactics despite revelations, violating Q2’s closure validity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage and film negative provide vivid atmosphere but don’t constrain choices or charge closure. Final image of maps/diaries as "testament" feels ornamental; no recurring object reweights meaning with cost, missing Q3’s 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("discover what walls dream about") remain abstract thematic declarations. No escalation: diaries’ revelations don’t narrow options or alter tactics—the cartographer simply "continued their work." Agency is passive observation, not decision/renunciation with legible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Over-reliance on thematic exposition: "legacy’s burden was not just a weight... but a story" and final moralizing ("story that would outlast them") violate Q5’s anti-patterns. Theme isn’t earned through particulars; climate shifts backdrop lacks integration with present stakes, triggering thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent atmospheric voice but slips into abstraction ("sensitively perceptive nature," "deep sense of loss"). Perceptual signature lacks specificity—no unique cartographer POV in noticing echoes. Final paragraph’s overwritten lyricism ("journey had come full circle") dilutes pressure without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong opening rhythm devolves into scaffold loops: "rewound... mind racing" followed by "passage seemed darker" paraphrases emotional state. Closure beat overwrites with redundant metaphors ("testament," "journey full circle"), triggering Q7’s density penalty and dulling the final image’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Legacy’s burden" trope executed generically; climate shifts backdrop lacks fresh inflection. Corridor echo cartographer concept isn’t transformed through specific mechanics (e.g., how echoes constrain mapping). Derivative of gothic mystery without sufficient synthesis to pass Derivative Premise Guardrail.</comment>
