<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>No internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure; epiphanies feel unearned as Maria merely reaffirms existing worldview without contradiction. "Kindled humility" is label-only emotion lacking embodied struggle, violating Q1 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks visible cost: final image restates theme without reconfiguration ("dust... shaping the universe" echoes opening). Under Accumulative lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights stakes; thematic echo replaces earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail but setting remains ornamental; greenhouse damage sets mood yet never pressures choices (no resource constraints or spatial obstacles). Butterfly wing charges atmosphere but fails Q3 9+ gate by not constraining action or final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No active conflict or escalation; abstract "stake" (understanding reality) faces zero opposition. Desire to "strip needless drama" isn't dramatized—no friction between want and cost. Static pressure violates Accumulative escalation requirement for density increase with cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo dominates: "gradual change" restated verbatim across 7 paragraphs. Final paragraph moralizing ("world unfolding through quiet steps") triggers -0.7 penalty for explicit thesis articulation, replacing earned resonance with sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV consistent but voice lacks perceptual signature; all observations generic ("intricate patterns"). Template cadence dominates ("Maria moved... Maria pondered...") with identical sentence structures under emotional pressure, flattening rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops plague closure: "accumulated dust patterns" repeats verbatim in paras 5 and 15. Final-third cadence run ("Maria's research would continue... Maria found peace...") triggers -0.5 artifact penalty, dulling closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Derivative premise (scientist finds meaning in small object) with no fresh inflection; every insight rehashes "gradual change" without transformation. Avoids risk by staying in abstract philosophy, failing originality's "bold risk-taking" requirement.</comment>
