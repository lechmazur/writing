<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority rich in sensory detail but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet untested by meaningful internal conflict. "Mildly obsessed" remains label without visible tradeoffs, weakening micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("shadows rearranged"), but the "felt cost" remains oblique. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though the single deepening lacks sufficient causal pressure for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting anchors atmosphere vividly ("storm-tossed ridge fort," "sandalwood"), but environment never constrains choice or charges closure. Micro-setting (gold leaf booklet) functions well, yet dominant stake remains unmoored from physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("to chart unseen paths") lack visceral escalation; cost ("ambered hush vibrated") feels conceptual but insufficiently dramatized. Pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing options or altering tactics under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "ambered hush" reweighted in closure; avoids moralizing. Final image ("world grew lighter") offers resonant non-literal answer to cosmic mapping, though secondary stakes lack depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("words dripped like honey") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Voice modulates flawlessly with emotional intensity; elision (no dialogue) taught early and paid off in closure’s silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "eyes shone with otherworldly intensity" repeats verbatim (minor scaffold). Figurative language ("dripped like honey") avoids muddle yet slightly over-embellishes high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of oracle trope through sensory obsession, but "ambered hush" borders on pretension. Risk-taking heightens stakes, yet lacks one irreplaceable detail to breach 8.8 (e.g., ridge fort’s physical constraints).</comment>
