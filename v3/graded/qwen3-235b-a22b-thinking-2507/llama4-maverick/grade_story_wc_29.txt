<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but superficial; "cautiously hopeful" trait stated not tested. No embodied contradiction or cost in closure choice—vindication lacks sacrifice. Diagnostic label-speak ("nature was vindicated") triggers anti-pattern penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—disturbances "dwindle" without sacrifice. Causal lens holds but cost proof test fails; no on-page price paid for vigilance. Orientation solid but cost invisibility caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Radio station described vividly but static—no tool/environment constraint on choices. Charts and console glow create atmosphere but don't pressure decisions or charge closure. Micro-setting potential unused despite strong sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (stop disturbances) with one tightening (signal discovery), but pressure incoherent—colleagues watch helplessly, tricksters vanish without struggle. No visible cost or trade-off; agency feels unearned despite causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme ("restore balance") explicitly moralized in final paragraph—"bring harmony to the universe" violates Q5 anti-pattern. Lacks ambiguity; tricksters unambiguously "bad," Lyra purely heroic. No resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientific-poetic voice) with consistent POV. But peak-beat diction turns abstract ("thrill of satisfaction," "celestial ballet"), weakening rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping, but emotional descriptions lack specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Adjacent paraphrase loops ("ethereal grit... fabric of reality reshaped" followed by "hiss gave way to new sound"). Figurative density high in climax (3 metaphors in 2 lines), triggering overwriting penalty. Scaffold reduces propulsion despite strong opening rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cosmic trickster trope familiar; subsonic frequency angle fresh but underdeveloped. Transformation test fails—replace "celestial" with "alien" and story unchanged. Avoids middle-ground hedging but lacks emotional specificity in human-cosmic conflict.</comment>
