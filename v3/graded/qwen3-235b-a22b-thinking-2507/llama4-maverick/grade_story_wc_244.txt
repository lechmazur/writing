<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("deep-seated pain," "cure for loneliness") without embodied contradictions; micro-choices under pressure lack specificity despite strong motivation. Final renunciation of solitude feels earned but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (loneliness as ongoing process), but the Accumulative lens wavers—rumor chains lack causal mechanics. Cost proof test fails: no on-page image concretizes the price paid beyond Raven's internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ivy and moon rock function as micro-settings charging the final image ("ivory-covered station fading"), but the station’s spatial choreography remains generic. Sensory details (skeletal fingers, tense air) vividly constrain choice only in the opening beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (curing loneliness) tighten through rumor proliferation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the crowd’s shift feels coincidental. Moral calculus between connection and vulnerability deepens meaning, yet the cost remains diffuse rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (rumor chains as "gentle virus"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("world brighter because of their actions") risks thematic echo but escapes penalty via earned resonance. Non-literal answer to loneliness as collective process reweights prior material flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice modulates beautifully under pressure ("desperately jocular" to serene), with lyrical compression taught early. Perceptual signature falters in climax—generic abstractions ("sense of possibility") dilute Raven’s specific lexicon. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose soars in rhythm and specificity ("ivy tendrils like skeletal fingers"), but "cure for loneliness" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty. Minor scaffold in reflection beats ("driven by singular motivation") dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes disaster logistics with poetic hope through concrete details (rumor chains, moon rock). Avoids safety-middle via risky emotional specificity, though "catalyze chain reaction" borders on thematic template. Freshness anchored in lived-in station imagery.</comment>
