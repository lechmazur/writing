<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the skipper’s observant nature versus reticence, but the "luminescent ache" borders on abstract labeling without sufficient embodied degradation under stress during the lamp outage crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (resolve to protect the lighthouse), but the cost of the lamp’s failure remains felt rather than visible; the sea glass’s final glow lacks tangible consequence beyond mood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the sea glass and stacked stones constrain choices and charge the finale, with sensory details (dusty prisms, warming glass) woven into action rather than static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the skipper’s ritual stone-stacking, yet the "darkness" threat lacks concrete escalation; pressure accumulates texturally but without narrowing options or altering tactics meaningfully under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cairn’s glow reweighting "safety," avoiding moralizing, but the anonymous letters’ thematic role feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the skipper’s final resolve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soft blue like dawn," "ache emanating from the tower’s heart") creates rhythmic control, though "luminescent ache" repeats with diminishing specificity in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose flows with purposeful cadence ("meditative," "repetitive motion"), but near-synonym loops ("deep and abiding sorrow"/"luminescent ache") in the closure beat slightly muddle emotional precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse tropes through stone-stacking as emotional language and sea glass as embodied hope, though the anonymous letters concept leans derivative without transforming the central conflict.</comment>
