<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Scientifically romantic motivation lacks embodied contradiction; "sense of connection" remains abstract without struggle. Diagnostic label-speak ("scientifically romantic intensity") triggers -0.4 penalty. No visible cost in closure beyond satisfaction. Micro-choices lack tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds but escalation lacks deepening—whispered phrase inspires instantly without pressure. Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks on-page cost proof; "satisfaction" is conceptual not felt. Orientation clear but closure fails cost test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (smoldering coals, salt tang) vividly anchor twilight setting. Ember nexus and shell function as micro-setting but fail to constrain choices or charge final image per 9+ gate. Ornamental beauty outweighs functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("capture density of presence") remains abstract with no narrowing of options. Whispered secret complicates but no protagonist-driven deepening; satisfaction replaces visible price. Band guardrail for 8.0+ fails—no live option foreclosed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through shell examination avoiding moralizing. Final image ("fading glow of ember nexus") offers quiet resonance but edges toward sentimentality. Strong subtext in "revalue" yet risks thematic echo with "palette of resolve."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scientifically romantic intensity") with rhythmic control in descriptions. Consistent 3rd-person limited POV; no head-hopping. Minor register drift ("revalue" feels academic) but voice modulates effectively under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting with stacked modifiers ("warm orange light danced") and paraphrase loops ("sense of wonder... beyond mere scientific curiosity"). Template cadence in repetitive sentence stems dulls momentum. Final paragraph filter-verb stacks prevent 7.2+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of science/romance tropes but "pocket-sun alchemist" archetype lacks transformation. Emotional truth in scientific wonder feels authentic yet fails proximity check—swap "alchemist" for "biologist" with minor edits. No bold structural risk-taking.</comment>
