<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract labels ("turmoil within," "shape of collective grief") without concrete contradictory impulses; ribbon ritual lacks trade-offs that would charge the closure choice. Micro-choices remain observational rather than tactical under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("weight of grief begin to shift") under Accumulative lens, but mentor's spectral appearance resolves tension conveniently without prior causality. Strong sensory accumulation tightens the dominant stake toward crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse and butterflies create vivid atmosphere but function as postcard backdrop; neither constrains choices nor charges the final image beyond decorative resonance. "Lunar glow" and ribbon lack tangible pressure on the carver's actions despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: abstract stake ("discover shape of collective grief") remains undramatized as internal struggle, with no tightening of options or visible cost beyond vague "weight shifting." Spectral mentor resolves tension coincidentally rather than through protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing but "collective grief" insight feels imposed rather than earned through concrete struggle; butterfly symbolism operates generically without reweighting prior material. Final image ("beautiful and terrible") lacks the resonant ambiguity required for high-band thematic integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong lyric rhythm and sensory filtering through carver's POV, but "fiercely meditative" and "thundering calm" verge on stock phrasing. Consistent voice modulates well with emotional intensity despite minor register drift in "sweet scent of blooming flowers" cliché.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with purposeful variation, though "calm" repetition (4x) and "gentle" overuse create subtle loops. Minor scaffold in "her mind tracing the path..." and subject-verb error ("weight... begin to shift") prevent 9+ without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of grief tropes elevated by ribbon custom detail, but spectral mentor and butterfly migration feel derivative without transformative specificity. Emotional truth anchors universals yet avoids bold risk-taking that would distinguish it from mid-tier literary conventions.</comment>
