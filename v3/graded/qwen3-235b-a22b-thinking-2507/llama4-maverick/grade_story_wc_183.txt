<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation for finding the Garden is told, not embodied through choices; "blissfully aberrant" trait lacks visible tradeoffs under pressure. Internal conflict remains abstract ("past and present began to blur") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. No earned change or endurance with felt cost scales to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred (pressure builds through narrative density), but closure lacks legible cost: "peace wash over her" contradicts Earned Stasis requirements. Orientation succeeds early, yet "memories alter" creates causality drift without altering tactics. No visible price paid for the Garden's discovery weakens Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid carnival ship details (rusted corridors, rickety rollercoasters) create atmosphere but fail to constrain choices—e.g., fog thickens narratively yet never impedes movement. Micro-setting (emerald card) charges the final image weakly through "glowing" light, but no tool/environmental constraint shapes Lyra’s actions during key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the Garden) remains abstractly declared without concrete on-page testing; "trapped freedom" tension never manifests as a live trade-off. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks deepening—no narrowing of options or knowledge shift that alters Lyra’s approach. Stakes feel visceral in description yet inert in execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory fragility emerges through setting ("metaphor for fragility"), but final paragraph’s "state of mind" realization borders on thematic echo, stating the concept rather than reweighting it through action. Emotional aftereffect is muted by Lyra’s abrupt "peace" without earned ambiguity, reducing complexity to serene resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV consistency holds, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—"blissfully aberrant" tells rather than shows Lyra’s unique cognition. Voice modulates weakly under pressure; high-stakes moments ("shiver down her spine") default to generic phrasing. No head-hopping, yet compression of memory blurring feels untaught for the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Multiple artifacts dull closure: "memories alter" creates logical muddle, while "peace wash over her" uses passive voice during peak revelation. Template cadence ("As she [verb], the [noun] [verb]") repeats in high-pressure beats, and therapy-speak ("recapture the essence") reduces density. Final image lacks textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival ship offers fresh metaphor potential, but "chimera twin discoverer" and "Garden of Forgotten Names" feel like derivative fantasy tropes without grounded transformation. Emotional truth in memory loss is overshadowed by abstract, unearned resolution. No bold risk-taking elevates beyond familiar melancholic discovery framework.</comment>
