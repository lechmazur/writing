<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between fear and resolve is present but underdeveloped; "phobia-ridden" and "firmly adaptive" remain labels rather than embodied traits. Diagnostic phrase "vulnerability is power" violates peak-beat prohibition against thematic echo (-0.4). Micro-choices during decryption lack concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors library setting early, but decryption process lacks causal pressure—no tangible obstacles or cost during puzzle-solving. Charged Poise closure ("trembling certainty") qualifies but conceptual cost remains abstract; the "truth is in the shadows" revelation feels unearned without prior constraint. Lens holds as Causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rusted library and stars create atmosphere but fail to constrain choices—no dust impedes decryption, no spatial limitations heighten tension. Whispering seashell’s "soothing hum" is ornamental rather than functional; environment serves as backdrop, not active pressure. Misses 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting fear/betrayal) lacks escalation—decryption challenge resolves through willpower alone with no narrowing options or trade-offs. "Betrayal" backstory remains abstract, never testing commitment via concrete loss. Conceptual cost ("stepping from shadows") isn’t dramatized through action; pressure feels internal but inert.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Explicit moralizing ("prove that vulnerability is power") triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty; resolution oversimplifies into "I am a force to be reckoned with." Final seashell "hum in agreement" feels symbolically convenient rather than earned resonance. Theme stated, not emerged from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Register drift into clinical jargon ("firmly adaptive nature," "phobia-ridden") mid-crisis undermines authenticity. Consistent POV but interiority lacks character-specific texture—generic "tremble in hands" cliché. Rhythmic control weakens during decryption ("As I worked... After hours...") with repetitive stems.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops ("I felt... I was... I was...") and filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (≥3 lines: "I felt drawn... I felt a sense of purpose... I felt a shiver"). Template cadence in resolution ("I was ready... I was ready..."). Final paragraph’s "force to be reckoned with" is generic abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stunt-double phobia premise has potential but executed generically—no fresh inflection (e.g., how stunts specifically inform decryption tactics). Transformation of "vulnerability as power" feels derivative; no bold risk-taking beyond familiar self-discovery arc. Setting/tone lack memorable particularity.</comment>
