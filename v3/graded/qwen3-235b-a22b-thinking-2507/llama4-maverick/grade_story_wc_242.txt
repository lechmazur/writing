<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "teach endings how to begin" reads as abstract theme statement rather than earned motivation. Operator's "peace" during peak pressure avoids embodied struggle, violating emotional progression realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "felt a sense of peace" shows no visible/felt cost for the "continuous cycle." Accumulative lens holds, but Charged Poise lacks undeniable pressure as operator faces no narrowing options or trade-offs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subway tunnel anchors atmosphere vividly ("hum of streetlamps," "ethereal tones"), but setting never constrains choices. Glass harmonica charges final image yet misses 9+ gate—environment doesn’t alter tactics despite lyrical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("sense of purpose," "deep connection") with no concrete test. Pressure never tightens; the loop pattern is observed but operator’s agency doesn’t narrow options or face trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cultivated estrangement" is overtly stated rather than emergent. Final paragraph’s "taught endings how to begin" triggers Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6), replacing earned resonance with prompt-like moralizing that undermines complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("melodically haunted quality") and rhythmic control shine, but stress-response lacks degradation ("smiled to themselves" amid peak connection). No head-hopping, yet voice converges during high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hum of streetlamps" scaffold (4 repeats) and synonym churn ("haunting, yet beautiful" → "beautiful and melancholic") dull momentum. Final paragraph’s template cadence ("And as... And in this moment...") triggers -0.4 loop penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cultivated estrangement" offers fresh inflection on anonymity, but "teach endings how to begin" feels like writing-template language. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.7) as emotional calculus lacks non-obvious risk.</comment>
