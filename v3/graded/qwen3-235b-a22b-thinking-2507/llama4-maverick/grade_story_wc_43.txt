<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Lena's calm professionalism overshadows authentic struggle despite "frail yet determined" Emma. Key moment: "execute a flawless goodbye" reads as clinical goal rather than conflicted desire with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("Emma was gone, her spirit remained"), but lens ambiguity early (shifts from causal blood work to accumulative texture) weakens escalation. Final image reconfigures stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting remains postcard-vague ("radiant haven above clouds") without constraining choices, though vinyl shard and scent of hope charge the final image. Sensory details vivid but lack causal pressure on tactics despite strong selectivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation under Accumulative lens, but "execute flawless goodbye" lacks dramatized friction. Cost (Emma's death/Lena's burden) is felt yet not viscerally shown in closure beat; agency remains observational rather than active choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scent of hope's evolution from metaphor to tangible presence, avoiding moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to "peace through music" without stating moral, though concept borders on abstraction in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in musical/sensory filtering ("hum of gentle choirs," "creak of floorboards"), with rhythmic control under pressure. Consistent lyrical voice avoids head-hopping; elevated diction fits hospice therapist POV without jarring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "scent of hope" repetitions (5x) and "pulsing stillness" cliché, but no closure-dulling artifacts. Strong propulsion via concrete verbs ("weave soundscape," "breathing slowed"); final line's "waft" recharges motif with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Transforms hospice trope through musical framing ("hymning the mundane"), but "radiant haven above clouds" feels derivative. Fresh detail: vinyl shard as continuity symbol. Emotional truth elevated by specific blood work/stethoscope details avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
