<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("bitterly sweet nostalgia," "quaking reverie") dominates peak beats without embodied contradiction; prince's motivation to restore beauty lacks conflicting impulses or micro-choices under pressure, reducing interiority to thematic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—tears and rebirth imagery omit sacrifice; Accumulative lens holds but final shift ("world begin to shift") feels unearned by causal steps in device assembly, failing cost proof test at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Suspended palace and egg provide vivid atmosphere but fail micro-setting test: stalactites' energy and egg patterns don't constrain choices (e.g., device assembly works identically anywhere), capping near 9+ gate despite strong sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes (restoring beauty) escalate texturally but lack protagonist-driven pressure; assembly action narrows options yet pays no visible price (palace shudders passively), violating band guardrail requiring cost to charge final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("beheld the world's rebirth") explicitly states the central question's answer, triggering -0.6 penalty; egg/device symbolism remains ornamental rather than charging closure with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mechanical heartbeat," crystal spires glinting) sustains Accumulative lens, but peak-beat diction ("heart swelled with emotion") reverts to generic label-speak under pressure, diluting rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Template cadence ("The prince felt... The prince worked... The prince's thoughts...") in high-pressure beats triggers -0.4 penalty; lyrical density obscures propulsion during device assembly, with final-third artifacts dulling closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Derivative "flawed genesis" premise lacks transformative specificity—suspended palace and egg feel like generic fantasy tokens; swap "crystal spires" for "ivory towers" and stakes remain unchanged, failing transformation test.</comment>
