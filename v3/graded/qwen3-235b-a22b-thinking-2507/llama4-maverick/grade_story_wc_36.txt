<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("harvest insights from failure") stated but not dramatized through conflicting choices; transformation lacks earned micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction absent during flute playing despite "triumphs and failures" reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure with driftwood markers pulsing as cosmic stillness crystallizes, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—static ritual without narrowing options. Cost ("felt changed") remains abstract despite vivid final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Canyon hush functions as micro-setting charging the final image, and flute constrains action (uncasing/re-casing), but terrain never pressures choices. Sagebrush scent and thunder integrate well but lack tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>No discernible conflict escalation; "turmoil beyond horizon" never tests motivation. Stakes remain abstract ("mysteries of the past") with zero on-page opposition or trade-offs. Flute's power accepted without struggle, violating escalation requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of learning from failure undermined by direct statement ("to harvest insights... was her true motivation"), triggering Q5 penalty. Canyon hush gains resonance but final "forever changed" feels like thematic echo rather than earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("avalanchingly quiet") and rhythmic control elevate lyrical mode, but filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she allowed") dull immediacy in high-pressure flute sequence, slightly muddying focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "avalanchingly quiet" repetition and template cadence in flute description ("it was as if...") create subtle synonym churn. No closure-dulling artifacts, though figurative density slightly overpowers pressure in middle beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tropes (mystic flute, canyon ritual) transformed through specific driftwood markers and "sagebrush/thunder" sensory pairing, but avoids bold risk—relies on familiar contemplative framework without fresh emotional calculus or structural innovation.</comment>
