<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks embodied contradiction; researcher’s motivation is stated but no micro-choices reveal internal struggle under pressure. "Subtly manipulating the narrative" reads as diagnostic label-speak without felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "backwards aging" trait revealed too late (~180 words), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands but cost remains conceptual—student’s understanding lacks visceral price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sycamore hush and pond ripples charge the final image, but "floating rock" setting never constrains choices. Cap at 7.0 from Q2 orientation penalty limits higher band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (transmission of vanishing art) deepen via pond metaphor, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency. Cost feels abstract—no tangible loss alters tactics despite "magnetic grotto" pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thematic Echo: "delayed revelation" named repeatedly; final moralizing ("lessons would stay with them forever") triggers -0.7 penalty. Conceptual cost isn’t earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (water patterns as metaphor) but "sycamore hush" repetition creates uniform tics. Rhythmic control weakens in high-pressure beats with filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: "patterns in the pond" restated 3x consecutively. Overwriting in peak beats—metaphor density obscures causality ("concentric rings" described 4x without progression).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tropes (mystic teacher/student) transformed via "backwards aging" specificity, but premise leans on familiar meditation clichés. Risk-taking lacks bold structural payoff.</comment>
