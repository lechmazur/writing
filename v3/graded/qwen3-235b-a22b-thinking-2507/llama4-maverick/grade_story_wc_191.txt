<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses under pressure; "wisely adventurous" is label-only with no embodied tradeoffs during the mural peeling or throne claim. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond vague "weight settling," failing the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands but cost remains abstract ("weight settling into being"); no exact sentence/image where cost is legible. Two distinct non-closure issues (cost ambiguity + passive agency) trigger -1.5 cap per rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard details are vivid but ornamental; the ruby flake guides without constraining choices. Misses 9+ gate requirement as no micro-setting (tool/body/object) charges the final image or alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation via mural revelations deepens knowledge but agency is passive (ruby flake "illuminates" path). Sunrise timeframe fails to tighten decisions; no visible price altering tactics despite "palpable anticipation" phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Final moralizing ("new era begin") triggers -0.6 penalty for thematic echo. Theme emerges through murals but isn't earned via struggle; restoration feels unearned without confronting hubris' cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose lacks distinct perceptual signature; all descriptions generic ("sweet scent," "soft chirping"). No rhythmic control under pressure—high-stakes throne ascent uses identical "she felt... she knew..." cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Template cadence ("Aria's gaze fell... she reached... she knew") in critical beats. Filter-verb stack ("she felt the weight settling") in closure scene prevents 9+ eligibility per artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Predictable throne-restoration arc; no fresh inflection in climax. "Futuristic nostalgia" lacks emotional specificity, leaning on tropes (cybernetic birds, twin suns) without transforming them through character struggle.</comment>
