<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation "to cultivate sparks" lacks contradictory impulses; merging with dune presents no visible cost or internal struggle beyond disorientation. "Dreamless" trait is stated but never tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works (re-solidifying at dawn), but cost of dissolution remains conceptual, not legible—no sentence shows Asa paying price for merging. Lens (Accumulative) holds, but cost proof test fails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dune glow pressures choices via disorientation ("difficult to discern reality"), and chess clock constrains climax (reactivation). Final image charges closure, but "after forest burns" backdrop lacks causal weight beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("cultivate sparks") remain abstract; escalation is atmospheric (intensifying glow) not causal. Clock reactivation solves conflict too easily—no meaningful tightening or visible cost paid for merging with dune.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth emerges through concrete images (charred remains illuminated by dune bloom), avoiding moralizing. Final clock tick reweights "frozen hands" as beauty from ashes without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand shimmered," "fractured lullaby") with rhythmic control, though "wave functions" jarringly shifts register. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax ("kaleidoscope of color and sound" violates physical logic); template cadence in descriptions ("As she walked... The air vibrated..."). No closure-impacting loops, but density issues dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via "divergent archive" and dreamless guard, but "sparks" metaphor feels generic. Emotional truth in merging outweighs risk-taking; resolution lacks friction for true originality.</comment>
