<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks embodied tension; "furiously tranquil" remains label-speak without physical manifestation. Micro-choices lack pressure—retrieving the envelope involves no struggle against wind or hesitation. Epiphany about "cartography of scars" feels abstractly intellectual rather than earned through visceral struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: masks slipping with visible cost ("confront the truths she had hidden") crystallizes her stance. Storm dissipation parallels internal shift, but escalation lacks tangible pressure—vigil remains static observation rather than tested endurance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory creates vivid atmosphere but fails to constrain choices—wind doesn’t threaten the envelope or force adaptive movement. Darkroom timer recurs but functions only as passive symbol; its ticking doesn’t alter tactics or charge the final image beyond thematic echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scars) is clear but conflict remains purely internal with no concrete escalation. Storm fury intensifies texturally, yet no beat tests commitment—retrieving the envelope lacks stakes (e.g., wind could rip it away). Cost is felt but not viscerally paid in action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo ruins resonance: final paragraph explicitly states "map the hidden patterns," violating organic emergence. "Cartography of scars" motif leans into therapy-speak abstraction rather than arising from concrete struggle. Epiphany feels imposed, not earned through specific experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice dazzles with lyrical precision ("chorus of the damned," "storm-kissed wonder") and consistent perceptual bias. But register drift undermines POV—poet uses academic phrasing like "rarefy the air" mid-hurricane. Micro-tics ("she felt") accumulate but serve reflective tone without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose sings with rhythmic control ("winds howling... chorus of the damned") but overwrites key beats: "maddening vortex of sound and sense" followed by "sudden stillness" uses clichéd metaphors. Filter verbs ("she felt") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Familiar storm-vigil frame gains specificity through darkroom timer and bus timetable, but "cartography of scars" feels derivative. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens atmosphere yet lacks transformative stakes—could swap premise with "dancer confronting past" with minor edits.</comment>
