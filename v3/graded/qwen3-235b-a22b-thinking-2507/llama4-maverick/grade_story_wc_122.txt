<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat numbness is clear but emotional progression remains abstract; "emotional numbness that had threatened to consume her" edges toward therapy-speak without embodied contradiction in pivotal humming beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Charged Poise closure, but cost proof fails: no on-page sentence/image showing tangible price paid for Aria's peace beyond stated "numbness recede".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cavern's earthy sensory details (damp soil, worn tools) charge the final image, but setting doesn't constrain choices—drums respond passively rather than shaping Aria's tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens via humming intensification under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks visible trade-offs; no tangible loss (e.g., physical strain, failed attempt) alters her approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" concept resonates through recurring vibration motif, but final paragraph's "she knew that she would never let it go" veers toward thematic echo, slightly muddying earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers danced across drum surface", "voice barely audible") maintains consistent sensory bias; rhythmic control modulates beautifully from meditation to "insistent" humming climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("gentle rustle of turning seasons" repeated verbatim); "enthrall" overuse (3x) triggers −0.2 scaffold penalty, but propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs like "coaxing", "weaving".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Deaf musician premise transformed through vibration-centric sensory logic, but emotional arc lacks specific verifiable detail—numbness defeat feels universal rather than anchored to Aria's unique craft.</comment>
