<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks depth; "luminous ache" is label-only therapy-speak. Motivation to "harness the ephemeral" feels abstract without concrete micro-choices during tremors. Epiphany about transcending self arrives abruptly without prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—tremors stop cleanly with no specific loss, making "luminous ache" feel unearned. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup, but stakes ("world torn apart") disproportionately exceed on-page consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lunar observatory functions as vivid postcard but fails to pressure choices; tremors would occur identically elsewhere. Clock hand as micro-setting charges the final image but doesn’t constrain earlier actions like repair attempts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via tremor intensity but resolution lacks cost—observatory holds "firm" with no visible price paid. Agency is passive (Eli works while events happen); "changelessly constant" deepens theme but doesn’t narrow options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through clock hand’s evolution from spinning to stillness. Final image reweights "changelessness" without moralizing, though "transcending self" edges toward abstract statement in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical voice has strong perceptual signature (camera repairer noticing light/motion), but "ephemeral" and "luminous ache" drift into academic diction. Consistent focalization avoids head-hopping despite reflective passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Earth tremors were a sign that the very fabric..." is overwritten abstraction during crisis. Paraphrase loop in "he began to ponder... he wondered" dulls momentum. Final paragraph cadence shifts effectively but "forever changed" is cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock hand as continuity symbol amid chaos, but "harness the ephemeral" feels prompt-derived. Emotional truth in quiet resilience outweighs derivative escape velocity metaphor.</comment>
