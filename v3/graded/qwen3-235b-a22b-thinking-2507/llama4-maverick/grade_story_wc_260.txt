<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority leans on therapy-speak ("fragile convictions," "balance self-respect and compassion") without embodied contradiction; epiphany feels unearned as micro-choices lack struggle (e.g., tail-grasping resolves doubt too easily).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "convictions reshaped like a river" offers poetic resolution but no visible price paid for shedding assumptions; the "con revealed" backstory remains unexplained, undermining causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric ("mist clung like a damp veil") but inert; the workshop and stars function as decorative backdrop rather than constraining choices (e.g., mist never impedes action or alters tactics).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes never materialize in scene: "con revealed" backstory is vague placeholder, and internal conflict dissolves without escalation or trade-off; the chameleon interaction resolves doubt with zero tangible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("she would find a way to balance..."), violating organic emergence; theme is stated rather than earned through action, triggering -0.6 for Thematic Echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice but lacks character-specific perceptual signature; under stress, thoughts remain perfectly articulated ("quietly vivid world"), missing degradation expected in crisis (e.g., no fragmented syntax during doubt).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: metaphors pile up ("sculpture from marble," "delicate glass vessel") without pattern-teaching, obscuring emotional truth; template cadence ("As she...") dulls immediacy in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Derivative premise (disillusioned professional finds peace through nature); chameleon symbolism is clichéd, and "con revealed" backstory lacks transformative specificity, failing freshness test.</comment>
