<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in action; "steadily unpredictable" is stated but not embodied through micro-choices. Diagnostic "anguished joy" label appears without specific embodied cost during pivotal vision. Colleague functions only as plot device with no relationship pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is valid Charged Poise with crystallized options ("sense of closure"), but cost isn't legible on-page—no specific sentence shows the price paid for transformation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase, though pattern break lacks causal testing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Archive setting provides atmospheric texture but never constrains choices or supplies resources; historian faces no spatial obstacles. Bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting but doesn't alter tactics—it's passively gazed upon rather than actively handled under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (forbidden knowledge) are clear but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the pagoda's power is passively received, not earned through tested choices. "Avoid patterns" instruction isn't dramatized, leaving escalation driven by convenience rather than meaningful trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" remains abstract metaphor without concrete reconfiguration; final image reweights conceptually but lacks undeniable social or emotional cost. Avoids moralizing yet "anguished joy" repetition becomes thematic echo without earned ambiguity or competing perspectives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct poetic texture ("saffron-veil," "luminescent orbs") but filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "realized") dull immediacy during climax. Under peak pressure, syntax maintains lyrical cadence instead of compressing—vision sequence lacks stress-appropriate diction shifts despite strong sensory selectivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in "As she..." constructions and paraphrase loops ("anguished joy" x4 with minimal variation) dull closure beat. Final paragraph's "journey had been worth the anguish and the joy" redundantly echoes prior labels without deepening, violating momentum in critical payoff zone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Purple-prose tropes ("atoms of nostalgia," mystical artifact) transformed through specific details (bronze prism pagoda, saffron-veil) but core premise (object reveals truth) remains familiar. Lacks bold risk-taking—avoids testing "avoid patterns" instruction, settling for safe mystical-revelation template without fresh moral calculus.</comment>
