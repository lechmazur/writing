<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("collect weights of burdens") without concrete embodiment or micro-choices under pressure; internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses, relying on thematic labels like "boundary-lessly trapped" without visible tradeoffs. The final endurance lacks causal groundwork for earned stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis (vanishing after completion) has conceptual cost but fails "cost proof test": no on-page moment where burden-collection's price is legible. Accumulative escalation lacks density increase—repetitive sensory description without pattern break weakens pressure toward closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail anchors atmosphere ("damp earth," "luminescent fungi"), but bronze grotto never constrains choices or charges closure; micro-setting fails 9+ gate as environment remains decorative backdrop without tactical impact on weaving process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("weights of burdens") remains abstract and undramatized—no concrete burden manifests or tests commitment. Pressure lacks meaningful deepening; "delicate balance" insight feels unearned as no trade-off or cost alters tactics during weaving, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tapestry metaphor, but final paragraph's moralizing ("reminder of beauty and complexity") triggers Thematic Echo penalty; resolution oversimplifies burdens into "hidden patterns" without embracing complexity, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "fractal" sensory filtering ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie"), though reflective interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("boundary-lessly trapped"). Consistent lyrical compression avoids head-hopping despite single-POV constraints.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity marred by paraphrase loops ("With each step... With each passing moment") and filter-verb stacks in climax ("the weaver felt," "she closed," "began to weave"). Final-third artifacts dull closure’s propulsion despite otherwise controlled prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Transforms contemplative tropes through "fractal" texture and "shingled hush" motif, but risks remain safe—no bold structural choice heightens stakes. Emotional specificity avoids templates yet proximity to mythic archetypes limits freshness without sufficient verifiable detail.</comment>
