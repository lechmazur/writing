<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("rhythm of repair") but interior contradiction absent; epiphany feels unearned without visible struggle. Micro-choices lack hierarchy—Kael's passive discovery forecloses no path with tangible cost, reducing "peace" to abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise (Kael's cosmic connection), but conceptual cost ("fragile world") remains undramatized. Orientation solid, yet Accumulative lens falters—pressure lacks density increase; discovery sequence feels linear rather than intensifying, with no narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("frost-encrusted glass," "wood smoke") anchors setting early. However, the frozen library never constrains choices—it's a static backdrop. Micro-setting (gears) charges the final image slightly but doesn't alter tactics during discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("rhythm of repair") stays abstract; no concrete test of commitment. Pressure never tightens—Kael's journey is passive discovery without trade-offs. Final "cost" is conceptual ("fragile world") but feels unearned, lacking visceral dramatization of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic harmony emerges through gear/mirror motifs, but final paragraph moralizes ("fragile and beautiful") with pseudo-profundity. "Secrets of the universe were now within their grasp" triggers Thematic Echo penalty, replacing earned resonance with tidy assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("indigo eyes drinking in tranquility") and lyrical rhythm elevate voice. Weakness: no stress-induced diction compression during door-opening climax—the prose remains uniformly ornate, missing opportunity for psychic distance shift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High textural density with resonant phrases ("driftwood nostalgia"), but adjacent paraphrase loops ("stepped into the library... footsteps echoed" / "navigating frozen shelves") dull momentum. Template cadence ("As they...") recurs 4x, though not in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lunar-eclipse locksmith" offers fresh occupational angle, but hall-of-mirrors trope remains untransformed. Emotional truth feels archetypal—Kael's journey lacks idiosyncratic stakes. Strength: "driftwood nostalgia" as specific, non-cliché motif charging the finale.</comment>
