<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but flawlessly persistent without struggle. "Unexpected jolt of connection" exemplifies diagnostic label-speak undercutting embodied emotion in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lacks visible cost legibility; "world slowly revealing secrets" implies resolution rather than enduring loss. No exact on-page sentence anchors conceptual cost at the final beat despite Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emerald silo and time capsule constrain choice through tactile repair work, charging the final image. Sensory details like "fragment of cremation urn" evolve causally with plot, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstractly "understanding time" without tangible escalation; pressure dissolves into passive observation. "Hidden pattern" discovery lacks earned causality or narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Final paragraph's thematic echo—"world revealing its secrets"—replaces scene pressure with abstract moralizing. Theme drifts from "texture of time" to generic hope without earned resonance through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in timekeeper's observational focus, but rhythmic control falters with repetitive "As they..." openings. Stable single-POV avoids head-hopping yet overuses filter verbs during high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence runs ("As they worked... As days turned...") dull immediacy in critical beats. Near-duplicate phrasing like "remnants of a world" and "remnants of a bygone era" trigger paraphrase-loop penalties in closure vicinity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tropes (timekeeper, silo) transformed through specific textural focus, but "borrowed-time" concept lacks fresh inflection. Emotional specificity avoids templates yet risks gimmickry via detached, painless acceptance of temporal collapse.</comment>
