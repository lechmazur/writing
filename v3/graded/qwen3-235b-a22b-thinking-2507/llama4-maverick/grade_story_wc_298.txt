<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("scent of damp earth clung to her skin") and micro-choices (smoothing card edges), but transformation lacks contradictory impulses during peak pressure; "dusky resolve" feels slightly abstract without visible struggle against the darkness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("darkness still there, but no longer overwhelming"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sensory density builds to the card's reconfiguration, with the orchard's transformation making the before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting: roots/bones supply spell materials that constrain choices (e.g., "soft earth gave way"), and the burned card charges the final image; "half-lit corridors" glow lacks active time pressure despite atmospheric use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (soul repair) escalate through textural deepening as air "thickens with otherworldly energy," narrowing options via the spell's demands; cost is unmistakable in lingering darkness, though the "tightening" leans more toward emotional reconfiguration than tactical narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tarot card's transformation, with the final image ("card pulse with gentle, fierce energy") offering resonant non-literal resolution; "bartered destinies" concept remains thematic echo rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("morbid perfume," "skeletal fingers") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor abstraction in "dusky resolve" prevents 9.0, but syntactic variety and voice-motivated compression ("began to weave a spell") shine.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("fiercely gentle touch" shows specificity), but "trammel the darkness" registers as forced abstraction in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy despite otherwise clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb orchard as healing space transforms "magical forest" tropes; risk-taking with textural closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity (bones woven into spell) ensures emotional truth anchors universals.</comment>
