<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete contradiction; "tenuous absolution" remains abstract label without embodied struggle against transgressions. Micro-choices absent during key moments like gardener's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "tenuous absolution" is repeatedly stated but never tested or paid for. Accumulative lens holds yet density increase lacks conceptual reweighting—bread's mystery unresolved without consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tea house description vivid but static; overgrown courtyard never constrains choices. Bread functions as thematic symbol only, failing micro-setting gate for 9+ by not altering tactics or charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens: "tenuous absolution" stated but never deepened or challenged. Dominant stake (finding sacred in ordinary) faces zero pressure—gardener's arrival changes nothing, leaving cost invisible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "bread had been a key to unlocking..." triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Theme emerges from abstraction ("profound truths in ordinary things") not earned struggle, undermining resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct sensory rhythm in early paragraphs degrades into abstraction ("sense of peace," "beacon of hope"). "Creeping normality noticer" title feels imposed, not organically revealed through perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in backstory summary: "Some said it was... while others claimed..." paraphrase loop interrupts flow. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw") accumulate but avoid peak-beat severity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Vanished bakery" trope transformed by bread's quiet presence yet constrained by generic "secret garden" framework. Emotional specificity in tea-sipping moments lacks risk—hedged by safe middle-ground spiritual platitudes.</comment>
