<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on clinical labels ("drowsy alertness") without embodied contradiction; "religiously skeptical" trait never tests the explorer's actions against the psychic radio. No visible cost for uncovering truth undermines final "clarity."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lacks legible cost: logbook discovery yields instant "satisfaction" with no enduring consequence for the "swallowed truth." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but Charged Poise fails without felt price at "newfound clarity."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tunnel atmosphere vividly anchors decay through scent/sound, but the beaded valve wheel never constrains choices—it’s a static symbol. Final logbook image charges closure weakly without environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>Stakes remain abstract ("weight of swallowed truth") with no tangible trade-off; logbook "excitement" dissolves trepidation instantly. Pressure tightens via radio confession but resolves without cost, violating Accumulative escalation rules.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden industrial truths emerges through logbook/valve, but "swallowed truth" repetition borders on thematic echo. Final "clarity" states resolution instead of resonating through concrete cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV voice captures sensory decay well, but "drowsy alertness" and "conceptual repricing" intrude with clinical diction. Radio dialogue feels like exposition, not character-driven action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template cadence plagues key beats: "Their eyes adjusted... Their gaze fell... They wondered" (three identical stems). "Morbid perfume" creates mixed metaphor, muddling sensory clarity in high-pressure tunnel scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abandoned mill trope gains freshness through tactile valve wheel/logbook, but "factory ghost shift" concept remains thematic rather than driving concrete stakes. Risk in Accumulative structure undercut by generic closure.</comment>
