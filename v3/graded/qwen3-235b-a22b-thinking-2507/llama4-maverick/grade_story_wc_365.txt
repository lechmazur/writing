<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks concrete embodiment and contradictory impulses; motivation ("withheld truth") remains abstract without friction or visible struggle. Diagnostic label-speak ("senses reeling," "implications of her discovery") dominates pivotal moments without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands conceptually but cost remains unlegible—final transformation summarized ("senses reeling") rather than dramatized. Accumulative lens holds via density escalation, yet protagonist's passivity undermines causal pressure in key beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport provides vivid sensory anchoring early, but micro-setting (green glass shard) fails to constrain choices—only decorates the journey. Final image charges resonance yet lacks tangible cost linkage to the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) deepens texturally but lacks protagonist-driven escalation; pressure arrives via phenomenon, not agency. Conceptual cost remains abstract despite "kaleidoscope" sensory overload, failing to reweight tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard/glow imagery but final "changed forever" assertion replaces earned resonance. Avoids moralizing yet relies on unearned wisdom ("secrets uncovered") without showing the struggle's tangible impact on her worldview.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensory map maker" POV) shines with lyrical compression, though abstraction creeps into climax. Rhythmic control sustains under pressure, with patterned elision (multiverse transitions) taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Overwriting muddles closure: "kaleidoscope of images... threatened to overwhelm" stacks vague metaphors in high-stakes beat. Template cadence ("The map maker's [body part] [verb]") recurs 5x, dulling the final image's conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle via sensory map maker profession grounds multiverse tropes, but emotional truth lacks risk—transformation feels safe and unearned. No bold structural choices; premise works unchanged with generic "explorer" protagonist.</comment>
