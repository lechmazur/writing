<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Summoner's motivation is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; serene dedication shows no internal conflict or embodied struggle under pressure. "Overwhelming need to hush" remains abstract without visceral trade-offs or flawed choices that complicate the task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: location anchors ("nocturnal haven") remain vague past 120 words, obscuring spatial stakes. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but orientation debt caps high-band potential; lens (Accumulative) holds yet lacks density escalation in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details but setting functions as postcard backdrop; brook/night never constrain choices or charge the final image beyond atmosphere. Micro-setting (origami wing) gains significance too late to shape tactics earlier, missing 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("imbalance threatening harmony") remains abstract with no concrete cost dramatized; "tranquil blaze" payoff lacks visible price under Accumulative lens. Pressure deepens atmospherically but never narrows options or alters tactics through protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme drowns in explicit moralizing ("power of silence" in final paragraph), violating organic emergence. Final image (wing drifting) resonates weakly but is undermined by Thematic Echo penalty; complexity collapses into tidy resolution without lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct rhythmic control in meditation sequences, but "terrestrially cosmic" breaks POV lexicon with jarring register drift. Perceptual signature stays consistent yet lacks character-specific bias; emotional compression under stress feels overly calibrated rather than authentically strained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pervasive synonym loops ("tranquil atmosphere"/"tranquility"/"tranquil blaze") and template cadence ("as they breathed... as they entered...") dull closure image. Overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic energy" strings) obscures causality despite lyrical intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tropes (solitary mystic, origami magic) feel generic without transformation; "smoothed hush" offers no fresh inflection on silence motifs. Derivative premise guardrail applies—lacks specific lived detail to elevate beyond template, though tone cohesion shows modest risk-taking.</comment>
