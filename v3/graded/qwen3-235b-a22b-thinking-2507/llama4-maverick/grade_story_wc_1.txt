<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Label-only emotions ("felt a surge of curiosity," "overwhelming desire") lack embodied contradiction; internal conflict is summarized, not dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The "scorched testament" concept remains abstract thematic echo without visible struggle, rendering the peaceful resolution unearned despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with pattern convergence (ledger/frost), but cost remains conceptual ("fragility and beauty") rather than legible on-page. Orientation is crisp early, yet the Charged Poise closure lacks tangible forfeiture—peace settles without visible tradeoff, weakening the stakes reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that guides her walk and charges the final image ("etched in her mind"), but the canyon remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. Sensory details are vivid yet generic ("crisp night air"), missing tool/environment integration that would elevate to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering purpose) tightens via ledger/frost convergence under Accumulative lens, but cost is abstract ("scorched testament" as reminder). No tangible price paid—time, physical toll, or sacrificed opportunity—undermines escalation; resolution feels frictionless despite coherent pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Explicit moralizing in the finale ("pauses would forever be a source of inspiration") triggers Thematic Echo penalty; theme is stated rather than earned through struggle. Frost/ledger motifs lack transformative reweighting, reducing complexity to tidy resolution without lingering ambiguity or concrete emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice but generic perceptual signature—glass artist notices no light/refraction specifics, only universal "frost patterns." Rhythm remains uniformly flowing under pressure, missing stress-induced compression; "drifting resonance" repetitions dilute distinctness despite clean POV control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates ("As she [verb], she felt...") with synonym churn ("disorientation"/"fragility and beauty"). Overwritten metaphors ("world seemed to hold its breath") blur in high-pressure beats; final-third "felt a sense of peace" filter-verb stack dulls closure immediacy despite otherwise clean grammar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Derivative self-discovery arc (artist + nature epiphany) lacks fresh synthesis; charcoal ledger and canyon tropes feel recycled without character-grounded transformation. Emotional truth is generic ("peace settle within"), avoiding risk—no bold structural choices or specificity that would make the premise feel inevitable.</comment>
