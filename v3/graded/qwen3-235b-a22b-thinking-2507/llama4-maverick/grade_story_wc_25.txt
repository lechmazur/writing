<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong observational interiority ("identifying people's walks") lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; competence feels unearned as zodiac coin/key appear without struggle. Final choice (leaving) forecloses no path—she'll "be back"—with no visible cost for proving her point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through storm intensification and sensory density, but Charged Poise closure lacks legible cost: she gains validation without sacrifice. The "different energy building" feels abstract, failing the cost proof test for a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain navigation (compass failure forces observation) and enable the whisper payoff. Final image ("quietest voices travel farthest") is charged by the labyrinth's acoustics, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("whispers vs shouts") is signaled early and deepened via the stranger's whisper, but cost remains conceptual. No trade-off occurs—she faces no opposition or sacrificed resource, leaving escalation under the Accumulative lens abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the labyrinth's acoustics and mission; final image reweights "whispers travel farthest" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action (stranger's whisper), though complexity lacks counterbalance like fear of deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scanned ground for recent passage") weakens under pressure—voice stays uniformly lyrical during footsteps approach without compression. "Thrill of excitement" flattens urgency, missing stress-modulated rhythm for peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor density issues ("geomagnetic storm raging... spin wildly" redundancy) and template cadence ("As she walked... As she turned") but strong propulsion. Final line avoids sentimentality; no closure-beat artifacts prevent 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh container-labyrinth setting elevates the "whispers" premise, but key/coin feel like generic puzzle tokens. Emotional specificity lacks raw vulnerability—risk-taking in structure (Accumulative lens) isn't matched by human complexity in the whisper payoff.</comment>
