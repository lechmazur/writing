<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Archetypal "visionary" lacks interior contradiction; motivation remains abstract ("shape new dawn") without embodied conflict. No visible cost to choices despite high stakes, rendering endurance unearned. Flawed passivity ("she turned to radio frequencies") undermines agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: "disappeared into the dawn" offers triumphant legacy without legible sacrifice. Orientation debt past 120 words (no concrete who/when anchors) triggers -0.4 penalty. Lens ambiguity (hybrid/accumulative) undermines pressure coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico and storm setting provide vivid atmosphere but remain decorative postcards; environment never constrains choices (e.g., no physical interaction with portico during key decisions). Sensory details lack POV-filtered urgency during "shifting allegiance" crisis.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("variant allegiance") stays abstractly declared without concrete on-page test; prophet's rise occurs offstage. Pressure flattens as visionary observes rather than acts—no tightening choice forecloses options. Coincidence (radio fragments) drives plot, violating "luck may complicate but not resolve" rule.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("variant allegiance now a badge of honor") triggers -0.7 penalty for explicit moralizing. Theme emerges from labels ("gritty whimsy," "ancient shadows") rather than dramatized particulars. No resonant non-literal answer to central question—closure states victory without cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks character-particular perceptual signature; "lyrically prophetic" reads as generic descriptor. Micro-choices absent under pressure (e.g., no hesitation tuning radio frequencies). Over-reliance on abstract nouns ("allegiance," "narrative") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Template cadence ("As she stood... As she listened... As days passed") triggers -0.5 loop penalty. Synonym churn ("unfolding narrative"/"piecing together mosaic") bloats high-pressure beats. Final image ("disappeared into the dawn") suffers figurative muddle, dulling closure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" and "variant allegiance" feel like prompt-generated abstractions rather than lived details. Transformation test fails—plot works unchanged if "prophet" becomes "revolutionary." Derivative premise (lone visionary guiding change) lacks specific world logic to justify risk-taking.</comment>
