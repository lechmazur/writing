<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction (mechanic's precision vs. awe) drives the touch decision with visible cost in altered worldview. Slightly overwritten "essence of their being" line undermines embodied emotion in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "icy warmth of discovery spreading" crystallizes irreversible cost with causal lens intact. "Subdued awakenings" phrase slightly muddies the pressure at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Simulator functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (lever action) and charges final image, but sterile workstation details remain generic rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist agency tightens options causally from repair to touch, with visceral cost in "liquid fire" veins and shattered perception. Final "never see universe same way" lacks physical concreteness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete "time moves sideways" pursuit; final "icy warmth" reweights earlier motif without moralizing. Winged creatures motif repeats mechanically without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct mechanic's perceptual signature ("tightened final bolt") modulates rhythm under pressure. "Subdued awakenings" jargon breaks voice in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until final third where "subdued awakenings" and verbatim "hush of beating wings" repetition dull closure's immediacy with therapy-speak and scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time theory with xenobiology lens; "mechanically warm hands" detail grounds high-concept risk. Magnetic nexus borders cliché but redeemed by visceral execution.</comment>
