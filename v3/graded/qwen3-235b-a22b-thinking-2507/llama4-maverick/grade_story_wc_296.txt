<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation but epiphany feels unearned; "warlike serenity" repeats as label without embodied contradiction. Final choice lacks visible cost—freeing the figure triggers no consequence or trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Achieves Accumulative/Textural closure via Conceptual Repricing (mirror=soul revelation), but cost remains abstract. No on-page sentence makes stakes tangible—revelation changes nothing materially for the druid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("spongy ground," "grotesque branches") but setting never constrains choices. Orchard vortex pressures perception without altering tactics—micro-setting (seed) fails to charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mirror truth) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency. Frozen figure appears coincidentally; druid’s "unbending" is passive observation. Cost invisible—no tactical shift or forfeiture post-revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mirror crack, but final paragraphs moralize explicitly ("world full of mysteries"). Thematic Echo penalty: druid states thesis verbatim, replacing earned resonance with sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual rhythm ("scent of decay," "serpents" branches) but POV leaks ("the druid's attribute had led them"). "Warlike serenity" repeats as unembodied label under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric phrases marred by template cadence ("The druid noticed that..."). Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("they saw that it was holding...") dull immediacy; moralizing finale creates scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Derivative premise (cursed lake, soul mirrors) lacks transformative specificity. "Warlike serenity" is fresh but underutilized—no risk-taking heightens stakes beyond surface novelty.</comment>
