<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows grief through weaving motions but lacks contradictory impulses; "subdued ardor rekindling" tells rather than shows authentic struggle. No visible flaw-driven mistakes or cost in the final choice weakens Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with stars intensifying and maker feeling "oneness," but the cost ("subdued light") remains conceptual rather than legible on the page. Orientation is solid, yet felt stakes lack tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory's domed ceiling actively channels starlight for the origami method, while sandalwood/myrrh scents anchor grief in physicality. Final curtain ripples charge "withering to bloom" with environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes (grief vs. hope) are clear but escalation relies on magical curtain effects rather than protagonist agency. No visible trade-off during illumination—cost feels conceptual rather than dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through brooch "capturing stars" as transmuted grief, avoiding moralizing. Final image of tattoo stencil "shimmering" reweights "withering to bloom" without stating a moral, though "bloom again" edges near sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via grief-filtered details ("sandalwood as sorrow reminder"), but therapy-speak ("desolate landscapes of their soul") disrupts voice during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("ripple and flow like liquid") diluted by paraphrase loops: "genuinely artificial, crafted from finest materials" restates redundantly. Final paragraph's "kaleidoscope" overwriting weakens closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "curtains of intention" altering reality via origami coordinates elevates grief-to-art trope. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, though "withered heart" metaphor lacks sufficient transformation.</comment>
