<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("dull ache that Lyra sought to understand") and micro-choices during calibration, but flaws lack active complication—her trauma informs motivation without dynamic struggle in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("dull ache" persisting despite success), but cost legibility falters in final image; aurora-to-dawn shift deepens stakes under Accumulative lens without tangible price escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("rusty red groan" of beams) anchors atmosphere, but sunken orchard/shipwrecks remain ornamental—no constraint on choices or final-image charge beyond backdrop for aurora's colors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early (capturing "sound of trust breaking"), and calibration tightens pressure, yet cost remains abstract—"dull ache" stated but not viscerally dramatized in closure beat where peace overshadows loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through synesthetic details ("shattering of glass" as trust breaking), but "way forward" phrasing edges toward sentimentality, slightly muddying the resonant final image's ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("golden light" of mother's voice) and rhythmic control under pressure, though "battered marvel" repetition creates minor scaffold in high-stakes closure moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High density with evocative phrasing ("joyful cacophony"), but "battered marvel" paraphrase loop in final third dulls closure impact—artifact disallows 9+ per global rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and grief (colors as "faint whispers"), but "sound of trust breaking" leans metaphorical; swappability of ashen forge weakens irreplaceability despite emotional truth.</comment>
