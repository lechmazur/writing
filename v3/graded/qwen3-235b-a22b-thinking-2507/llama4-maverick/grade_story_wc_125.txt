<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion through stone-trailing and rope-clutching, but "insatiable hunger" and "texture of time" drift toward abstract labels without sufficient contradictory impulses. Final endurance of impossible choices earns stakes with felt cost, yet motivation lacks granular personal history beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when dawn reveals patterns as permanent truth with cost ("weight of those choices"), under Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear by line 3, but escalation lacks one decisive intensification—patterns deepen without narrowing options beyond the rope's symbolic transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto provides vivid sensory specificity (rust-red rocks, starlight glow), but functions as atmosphere rather than constraint; patterning could occur anywhere. The frayed rope qualifies as micro-setting charging closure, yet environment doesn't alter tactics or final image sufficiently for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (impossible choices) tightens through the rope's evolving symbolism and patterning intensity, with visible cost in "threads of fate vibrating." Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens, but the cost remains conceptual rather than demonstrated through concrete loss like stamina or tools.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from rope/patterning motifs reweighted at closure ("rope... symbol of complex choices"), avoiding moralizing. Final line's "art of living was a never-ending pattern" slightly echoes prompt language, but "texture of time" revelation stays earned through tactile discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "air vibrated with whispers of the past" and "ethically playful grin," with rhythmic control in sentence cadence. Minor register drift in "conceptual or social cost" phrasing, but no head-hopping and consistent lyrical compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose avoids scaffold loops but shows template cadence ("As she strolled... As she worked... As the night wore on") in mid-section. Strong verbs ("undulating," "coaxing") offset slight overwriting in "tactile sensation both rough and smooth," with closure image ("faded into background") clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Texture of time" synthesizes fresh inflection with universal stakes through rope symbolism. Avoids middle-ground hedging via passionate subtlety tone, though "energy beings" premise risks abstraction without deeper world logic exploration. Transformation test passes—replacing grotto with generic cave would break specificity.</comment>
