<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; "logically emotional" remains label-only despite sensory detail. Closure choice lacks visible cost—satisfaction replaces sacrifice. Micro-choices absent under pressure; adaptation occurs without struggle or trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis) lands but cost proof fails: no on-page sacrifice, only "satisfaction." Lens ambiguity hurts—Accumulative/Textural pressure lacks density increase; causal links (key→resonance) feel underdeveloped. Orientation solid but closure image dulled by abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting: ice creaks constrain perception and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (sound over visual) fits urgency, but "ethereal glow" clichés undermine specificity. Environment shapes tactics via vibrational matching, yet marina's rules remain vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("protect artifact from misuse") declared but never threatened—no antagonist or complication. Pressure stagnates: environment intensifies but narrows no options. Telescopic stakes fail; world-ending "secrets" vs. quiet tuning lacks visceral consequence. Agency passive; no trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sensory particulars but "sonic absolution" remains abstract. Avoids moralizing, yet final "fleshly ethereal world" line echoes thematic prompts. Lacks counter-readings; no complexity in "misusers" or artifact's true cost. Earned resonance undercut by vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("logically emotional" lens filters sound/sensation), but "ethereal" overuse (4x) creates loops. Rhythm varies well until climax, where repetitive "As she..." stems dull pressure. Voice consistent but lacks modulation under stress; no psychic distance shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Final paragraph paraphrase loops ("sense of peace... satisfaction... purpose") dull closure. "Fleshly ethereal" redundancy and vague "vibrational matching" mechanics reduce clarity. Strong opening line, but abstraction replaces textural specificity in peak beats. Template cadence in adaptation sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle via sonic physics, but "crypt keeper's key" feels derivative. Emotional specificity in sensory details elevates it, yet avoids bold risks—no real danger or moral ambiguity. Transformation test fails: swap "sonic absolution" for "magical artifact" and story unchanged.</comment>
