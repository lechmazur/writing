<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("mind begin to percolate") rather than embodied contradiction; final "satisfaction" feels unearned as no visible cost or micro-choices alter tactics during the eternal wait. Motivation ("distill complexity") remains tell-only without friction against concrete pressures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens—the fog clearing crystallizes the cost of waiting ("patience worn smooth") with the final lapping water echoing eternity. Orientation anchors firmly by 100 words, and lens consistency elevates the resonant reconfiguration despite minimal causal pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp earth, dripping water) vividly anchor the fog-bound river but fail to constrain choices; the yarn needle functions as micro-setting yet doesn’t charge closure meaningfully—the "glowing" needle feels symbolic rather than earned through tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No escalation occurs: the static "waiting" lacks tightening pressure or trade-offs under Accumulative lens. Fog clearing resolves the scene coincidentally without protagonist agency, violating "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" rule—the dominant stake (palimpsest promise) remains abstractly declared, never viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of distilling essence emerges through palimpsest metaphor but closure edges toward stated moral ("uncovered the essence"), undermining earned resonance. The final "world full of possibility" reweights prior material yet lacks the non-literal answer required for high-band scores, leaning on thematic assertion over concrete charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice ("spindrift serenity," "gloom-hill") sustains perceptual consistency, but stress fails to modulate syntax—prose remains uniformly poetic during high-pressure waiting, missing degradation under strain. No head-hopping, yet focalization lacks character-specific bias in noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffold appears ("as the mist swirled... as they reached... as he worked"), slowing momentum with repetitive "as" clauses, but rhythm variation and clean grammar prevent severe deduction. Final image’s "lapping water echo through eternity" avoids figurative muddle, preserving closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Transforms river-crossing trope through "gloom-hill" specificity and needle motif, yet emotional truth lacks non-obvious risk—safety-middle choices avoid bold stakes (e.g., traveler’s arrival resolves tension conveniently). Freshness diluted by familiar "fog clearing = revelation" convention without sufficient subversion.</comment>
