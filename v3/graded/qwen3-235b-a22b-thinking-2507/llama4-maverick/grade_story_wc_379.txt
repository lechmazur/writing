<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows curator’s empathy via locket connection, but writer’s grief lacks embodied contradiction; Emilia’s "listening heals" motivation feels intellectualized rather than viscerally earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with locket display note, but mailbox mystery escalation relies on convenient exposition ("mailman revealed...") rather than causal narrowing of options; cost of writer’s loss remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vibrant courtyard anchors early with sensory specificity, yet fails to constrain choices—tranquility disruptions don’t pressure tactics; locket charges final image but setting operates as postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling mailbox mystery) signaled early, but pressure flattens into tidy resolution; no tangible cost beyond emotional abstraction, weakening escalation’s legibility under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Listening heals" concept moralized in final paragraph via Emilia’s satisfaction, triggering −0.6 thematic echo penalty; locket’s reprise offers subtle resonance but can’t offset overt didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV maintains consistent curator’s perceptual signature (noticing locket details), though filter verbs dilute immediacy during investigation; voice modulates adequately but lacks rhythmic compression under narrative stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strategic telling dominates pivotal beats (writer’s backstory summarized), while "healing power of listening" phrasing triggers −0.4 thematic artifact penalty; clean syntax but momentum loss in mid-scene exposition loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Familiar tropes (reclusive writer, healing through objects) lack transformative specificity; locket/mailbox connection feels logically sound but emotionally generic, failing the "transformation test" for freshness.</comment>
