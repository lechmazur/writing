<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure weak; Lena's connection to the portrait lacks embodied specificity. Final scattering choice lacks visible cost scaling to story length—reverence replaces tangible stakes. Micro-choice to powder charcoal reveals value hierarchy but feels unearned without prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (transience of safety), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint. "Mirage of safety" deepening narrows options via Lena's scattering, yet orientation debt (delayed Eli introduction) caps escalation. Cost proof solid in ash-scattering moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery functions as micro-setting: spatial perspective directly charges the final image ("vanishing point" reconfigured through ash dispersal). Charcoal and porcelain shards constrain choices (powdering action), avoiding white-room syndrome. Sensory economy masterful—powder-coated frame detail charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety as illusion) signaled early but lacks visceral escalation. Lena’s scattering act forecloses engagement path with visible cost (longing), yet pressure remains cerebral. Agency in powdering action deepens knowledge but misses felt price—Eli’s dialogue explains stakes rather than testing them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final Eli dialogue ("truth not always what it seems") triggers -0.7 penalty: overt moralizing replaces earned resonance. "Mirage of safety" emerges from particulars but resolution leans abstract. Porcelain mask’s reprise charges closure, yet final line sermonizing undermines organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines (Lena’s tactile focus on powder/ash), but dialogue flattens under stress—Eli’s lines read as thematic mouthpiece. Rhythmic control falters in reflection blocks; "weaves truth carefully" violates POV lexicon. No head-hopping, yet stress compression lacks syntactic variation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density excels in setting descriptions, but "weaves truth carefully into the fabric" is therapy-speak label violating peak-beat embodiment. Template cadence in reflection blocks ("Lena begins to ponder... Lena finds herself drawn") dulls momentum. Final image ("shattered porcelain shards") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash-scattering profession with art’s transience elevates tropes. Bold risk in making destruction (scattering) the climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Derivative safety/mirage concept redeemed by porcelain mask’s charged specificity. Emotional truth anchors universals in Lena’s somber marvel.</comment>
