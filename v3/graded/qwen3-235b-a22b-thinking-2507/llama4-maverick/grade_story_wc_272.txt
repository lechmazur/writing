<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "luminescent ache" is diagnostic label-speak (triggers -0.5). Final shift to hope lacks visible struggle or cost, rendering endurance unearned despite rhetorical questions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure fails cost proof test: no on-page legible cost for the "unshakeable sense" ending. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Situational) persists past midpoint, violating gate rules. Orientation test passed but closure invalid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Library setting charges final image ("sanctuary") and constrains choice via tarot threads. Sensory details (dusty paper, flickering light) evolve with action, but lighthouse beam's late functional use caps Q3 below 8.5.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("purpose of art?"); no tangible tightening or cost. "Walls closing in" creates vague pressure without narrowing options. Agency passive—realization emerges from reflection, not active choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme stated overtly in final paragraph ("beauty and darkness entwined"), triggering -0.7 penalty. Epiphanies lack earned struggle; "fractured reality" concept echoes without altering tactics, reducing to abstract moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (artist's fragmented focus), but rhythm falters in high-pressure beats ("The more she untangled..."). Single-POV stable, yet reflective overuse dilutes immediacy during pivotal untangling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Template cadence in closure ("As she vanished... tomes whispered... artist's spirit remained") triggers -0.5. Synonym churn ("fractured/disjointed/shattered") and "luminescent ache" repetition create scaffold loops, dulling final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tarot/lighthouse tropes lack transformation; swap "portrait artist" for "writer" and story functions identically. Emotional specificity sacrificed to generic "artistic struggle" archetype, failing authenticity test.</comment>
