<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("helix-minded," "chaotically precise") without embodied contradiction; memory flood lacks contradictory impulses beyond generic "exhilarating and unsettling." Final "readiness" feels unearned as no prior flaw is tested or cost shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis through moonlit restoration, crystallizing Elara's transformation. But cost remains abstract ("changed her," "newfound purpose") without visceral on-page legibility—violating Q2 cost proof test despite strong Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon anchors early with vivid sensory specificity ("silvery glow," "quaking reverie"), but environment never pressures choices. The mirror functions as effective micro-setting, constraining all action through its physical state during restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stake ("uncover abandoned dreams") deepens via memory entanglement, but remains abstract with no tangible cost. Escalation succeeds through Accumulative density (memories intensifying as moon rises), yet "changed her" summary fails to deliver the required visible price for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently through mirror restoration, avoiding overt moralizing. Final image of "entangled memories" reweights the premise, but direct statements ("concept Elara had long been fascinated by") dilute subtext, preventing 9+ resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice overuses filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") and intrudes with authorial concepts ("synaptic plasticity"). However, "quaking reverie" tone modulates effectively with pressure, and perceptual signature stays consistent through moonlight imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Severe line-level artifacts: "chaotically precise mind" repeats verbatim, "entangled memories" churns as thematic mantra, and "quaking reverie... reverberate through every molecule" creates mixed metaphor. Template cadence ("As she worked... As the night wore on") triggers -0.5 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Derivative premise (memory-archeology trope) lacks fresh synthesis; "helix-minded" and "entangled memories" feel lifted from sci-fi templates without meaningful transformation. Emotional specificity avoids complete genericness but fails the transformation test.</comment>
