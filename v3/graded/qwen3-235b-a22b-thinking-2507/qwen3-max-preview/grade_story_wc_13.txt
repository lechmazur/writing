<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in profession (sketching before song) and embodied contradiction (trembling hands vs. precise action), but lacks deeper moral ambiguity in the final choice; cost remains physical (fatigue) without psychological weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—giant's awakening reconfigures stakes with felt cost (pendant's fading heat)—but the "cost proof" is slightly oblique; the exact sentence where conceptual cost crystallizes ("her work here was done") lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance canals actively constrain choices (e.g., dew-slick aqueduct affecting climb, chime timing altering tactics); the "amniotic silence" chamber charges the final image by transforming echoes from ghosts to living possibilities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when overborrowing causes the chime's ripple, but the cost (fatigue) doesn't materially alter later tactics; escalation is driven by agency yet lacks a visible trade-off that reshapes her approach to uncaging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final birdsong replacing alarms offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "temporal erosion," reweighting the premise without moralizing; the "unborn sound" motif evolves from abstract quest to tangible creation with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glyphs carved by forgotten acousticians") and rhythmic control under pressure (staccato fragments during panic), though stress-induced syntax compression could deepen in the chime crisis beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "peeling instants like petals from frozen blossoms" creates a subtle metaphor clash (organic growth vs. frozen stasis) that slightly muddles a pivotal moment; otherwise exemplary propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of resonance physics and temporal erosion feels inevitable; the "echoes as embryos" inflection transforms extinction tropes through specific, character-driven stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
