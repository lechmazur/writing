<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "analytically intuitive—not by training, but by survival," with embodied emotion in weeping at self-recognition. Final choice to press palm to portrait earns closure through prior causality, though arsonist backstory lacks micro-choices that deepen flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when archive shudders and voices rise, reconfiguring stakes with visible cost ("world above still thought her criminal"). Orientation anchors immediately in volcanic tuff setting; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density accumulation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Volcanic ash functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—"volcanic tenderness" constrains every choice from petrified ink smell to lapis pigments. Environment actively responds with "tremors" and "dust shifted," making closure’s dissolving walls inevitable through prior physical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory vs. entropy) tightens through protagonist agency when tapestry recognition forces artistic response. Cost crystallizes in "world above still thought her criminal" versus underground redemption, with escalation driven by her spiral reproductions narrowing options toward the pedestal chamber.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "frayed silence" and "scorched and sacred" duality, culminating in "mercy flowed—not as absolution, but as continuation." Final lullaby image reweights memory’s fire without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in "reading patterns in smoke, in charred spines," with rhythmic control shifting from fragmented urgency to lyrical closure. "Volcanic tenderness" refrain evolves meaning organically, though minor register drift occurs in "conceptual repricing" abstraction near climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold in peak beats, but "vandalized not by malice but by time’s slow erasure" risks telling versus showing. Final image’s "walls dissolved into light" avoids figurative muddle, though "lullaby of ash and resilience" slightly overwrites closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" synthesizes destruction/preservation into fresh emotional calculus, transforming library arson into sacred duty. Risk-taking heightens stakes through entropy-as-antagonist without gimmickry, though "future self calling backward" borders on familiar time-bending tropes.</comment>
