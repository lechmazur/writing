<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows patience through concrete action ("knees settled into permafrost without complaint") and micro-choices (feather placement), but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation ("translate heartbeats into maps") is profound yet unchallenged by internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves perfect Charged Poise: "map drawn in pulses" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("brutal" truth of hibernating life), while Accumulative lens holds through ritual density; orientation ("subarctic crater") anchors immediately without debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices (permafrost dictating kneeling posture, frost-laced bark guiding object placement) and charges the final image ("map alive against her ribs" directly stems from land's physicality); micro-setting (fox-fur wrap) enables chest-tucking closure beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (translating heartbeats) deepen through ritual density under Accumulative lens, with conceptual cost in the pulse-map's "brutal" truth, but lacks meaningful escalation via protagonist agency—pressure accumulates passively without competing choices or tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "valleys pulsing with hibernating bears" rather than abstraction; ending delivers resonant non-literal answer via pulse-map without moralizing, though "safekept starlight" borders on poetic vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("breath curled like slow smoke"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure; minor register drift in "grammar of celestial cartography" prevents 9.1 despite flawless focalization and zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks ("crimson sigils steamed like tiny hearths" blends image/action/theme); only deduction for slight synonym churn in "edges softened by salt and sorrow," non-closure-touching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes through specific constraints (subarctic crater, unused flash-paper); pulse-map concept feels fresh yet inevitable, but core premise remains recognizable as mystical ritual without radical synthesis.</comment>
