<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "serene anger" embodied in ink application and breath-holding; micro-choice of deliberate ink spill reveals hierarchy of values. Single-POV baseline met with no token traits—albino physiology directly informs eclipse observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: vanishing reweights time's purpose with undeniable cost ("boots last to go"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ink-pattern density; cost proof evident in Ghostwing's solitary hover after physical dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment functions as micro-setting—grit-carved tables constrain ink behavior, vanishing ink charges final image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors crisis: "pulse syncing with ink’s retreat" narrows perception while wind carries "whispers of old storms."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: ink spill observation ("she saw it—the key") deepens knowledge, forcing irreversible vanishing. Dominant stake (why time slows) tightens via her embodied experiment; cost crystallizes as she dissolves into "negative space between moments."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ink’s "Rorschach of impermanence" mirrors neural collapse, culminating in resonant CR where vanishing answers "why time slows" without moralizing. Final image ("stepped into ink’s final pattern") reweights crisis as self-chosen preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "raw from squinting into sun’s return" filters world through tracker’s physiology. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in cadence shift from "trembling horizon" to "seconds thicken like honey," with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractals that dissolved at the edges" compresses multiple functions. Figurative language ("time stretched like taffy") avoids muddle in peak beats, with propulsion maintained through visceral verbs like "hiccup" and "unraveled."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation trope: crisis reframed as neural self-preservation via ink patterns. Risk-taking heightens stakes—vanishing feels inevitable through prior ink experiments—but "serene anger" trope slightly echoes existing archetypes.</comment>
