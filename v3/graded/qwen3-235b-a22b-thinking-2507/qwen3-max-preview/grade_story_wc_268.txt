<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (exile's patience vs. burning mission) through concrete micro-choices like marginalia placement, but flaw integration lacks visible struggle during climax. Final renunciation of throne earns cost via prior causality, though "hollow echo" slightly over-articulates emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "truth is not a weapon" speech reweights the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost (people's self-blinding), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Constellation motif pays off disorientation early; cost legible in "bitterness of their blindness" and unworn crown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ancient temple library constrains choice via book-based messaging system (e.g., vellum sigil placement in Celestial Alcove), charging final image with "open book" closure. Dust motes and iron gall ink pellet function as micro-setting that alters tactics; sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects urgency (starlight > dust > ink).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking pretender) tightens through protagonist's agency: ink pellet deployment narrows options to revelation. Cost is conceptual (people's self-recognition) and visible in "bitterness of blindness," though escalation relies slightly on off-page convergence of librarian/scribe/general rather than on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "rune of drift" motif evolving from metaphor to action to final inscription "The crown is not worn. It is carried." Final line reweights truth's burden without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in custodian role vs. rulership. No thematic echo despite protagonist's speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust motes danced in starlight older than kingdoms" filters setting through exile's temporal scale. Voice modulates from poetic ("regally unpretentious") to stark ("steps as soft as settling ash") under pressure. Zero head-hopping despite multi-POV shards; focalization consistent within segments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("ink bleeding through parchment" compresses action/image/theme) with zero scaffold. Minor cadence risk in "Books lined the walls like tombstones..." but variation in sentence openings (gerunds, fragments) sustains rhythm. Final line’s parallel structure ("leaving behind...") earns poetic payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through library-based rebellion and "rune of drift" as organic action system. Emotional specificity in "hollow echo of justice delayed" avoids generic triumph. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via constellation motif, though "diminutive titan" slightly echoes existing mythos without full transformation.</comment>
