<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied contradiction (pulse as "borrowed time," dye as "whispered secrets") with micro-choices under pressure; the closure shift to cultivating fractures is earned by prior sun-trail observations and the old man's refracted silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where patrons' weeping and the fabric's response crystallize cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sun-trail pattern to final mist-curling image with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Floating tea house functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (her vantage point above mist) and charges closure; valley mist evolves causally to mirror her realization, with "moss-carved ledge" and silk ropes providing tactile specificity that pressures her observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as she shifts from wing analysis to studying the old man, narrowing options toward authentic fracture-cultivation; cost is unmistakable in the fabric's emotional detonation and patrons' visceral reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through iridescent fabric's behavior rather than statement; final line reweights "magnetism" via concrete image ("broken places gleam") without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through the cloth's silent resonance with children.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in light-fracture metaphors and rhythmic compression under insight ("patience detonates"); voice modulates from lyrical observation to crystalline clarity at climax without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero scaffold; "quiet explosion of insight" risks density but pays off in closure, while final line's cadence ("slant of light... broken places gleam") delivers resonant specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes structural color physics with human magnetism through dye mastery, transforming tropes via specific details (powdered scales, breath-warmed tears); risk-taking in accumulative lens heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
