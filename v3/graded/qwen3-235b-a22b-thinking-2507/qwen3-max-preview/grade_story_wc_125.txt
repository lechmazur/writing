<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via tactile rope engagement and moral ambiguity, but village elders lack embodied specificity; Silas remains off-page rumor weakening relationship crucible despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: rope's transformation into bridge crystallizes stance with visible cost (elders' tears), under Accumulative/Textural lens where each rope examination tightens the impossible-choice premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto anchors atmosphere but fails Q3 9+ gate—clay floor enables rope-laying yet never constrains choices; energy beings' light illuminates rope but doesn't alter tactics until climax, missing micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's spiral experiment drives escalation under Accumulative lens, narrowing options from abstract dilemma to tangible bridge-building; cost is visceral (village's paralysis broken by elders' recognition tears).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope's evolving meaning—refusal as third choice—avoiding moralizing until final speech, where "invitations to uncover layers" risks thematic echo but is redeemed by embodied gesture of laying the rope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tactile focus: "texture of time," "roughness of regret") sustains voice through pressure; rhythmic control falters slightly in "peels silence like an onion" metaphor, but elision of Silas' escape is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Peels silence like an onion" creates mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat; otherwise high density with concrete propulsion ("frayed ends brushing both sides"), though "hymns older than language" borders on abstraction without tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "prison escape rope" trope via moral ambiguity lens—refusal as active choice feels inevitable in hindsight—but energy beings risk derivative cosmic awe; specificity of rope's burns/frays elevates beyond template.</comment>
