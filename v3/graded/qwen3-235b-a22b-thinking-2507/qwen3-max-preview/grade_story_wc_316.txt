<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("joy and grief...") embodied through sensory details like "numbness shattered like ice," with final choice earned via micro-choices (palms on jar) under pressure. Secondary characters lack depth as thematic mouthpieces, slightly weakening relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("numbness shattered"), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where emotional density reweights stakes. Orientation debt waived—the disorientation serves closure’s metaphysical payoff, anchoring who/where by line 30 via "floating rock dojo" and "DUPLICATE" jar.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (brain jar’s "bioluminescent fluid") charges closure as the object constrains choice—Kael’s resonance "vivifies" it, making final image ("stepped from the jar without breaking glass") irreplaceable. Floating dojo lacks causal pressure on tactics, capping near-band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens via Kael’s silent endurance, narrowing options to balance as solution. Cost is unmistakable: "warmth return to his chest—not the heat of ego." Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but secondary "custody battle" slightly dilutes singular focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"I remember your pain. I do not want to inherit it" reweights ego death as liberation, not trauma. Final image ("aliveness") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moss-slick stones humming") modulates rhythm under pressure; elision of timeline fractures taught early and paid off in closure. Dialogue lacks idiom differentiation between Lira/Torvin, reducing voice distinction in peak conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("tendrils... like seeking fingers"), but paraphrase loop in "harmonize through complementary opposites" slightly dulls closure beat. No figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally despite one synonym cycle in emotional cataloging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ego death and clone tropes transformed via specific stakes ("emotional numbness calcified"). Risk-taking (metaphysical custody battle) heightens coherence without gimmickry, though "floating dojo" edges toward familiar archetype without deeper world logic.</comment>
