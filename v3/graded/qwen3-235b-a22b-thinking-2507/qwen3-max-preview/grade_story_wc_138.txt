<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (craving finality yet not death) drives the earned closure; embodied ennui ("sandpapered awe") avoids stock phrasing. Final wonder feels inevitable from prior causality, with sanctuary collapse as visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "prismatic escondite collapsed into a single point of indigo light" legibly sacrifices his refuge. Accumulative lens holds throughout—density peaks with "spatial mutiny" as the pressure point. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("prismatic escondite, a refuge woven...").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The amulet fragment as micro-setting constrains choice (centuries of waiting for magnetic storms) and charges the final image ("pulse of final goodbyes"). Sensory specificity ("shadows peeled... like liquid ink") evolves causally with spatial mutiny. Environment directly alters tactics via storm dependency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: aligning the fragment at the storm's crescendo narrows options to a single decisive act. Dominant stake ("what happens after goodbye") tightens as magnetic fields peak, with sanctuary collapse as visceral cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via density increase in farewell whispers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("quiet thunder of endings, hushed and holy") reweights boredom into wonder without moralizing, answering the central question through sensory charge. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (lullaby cut short, poet's stanza), avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo—resonance is earned through spatial mutiny's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("galaxies collapse into sighs") filters cosmic scale through tactile detail. Rhythmic control under pressure ("walls screamed as they inverted") modulates with spatial mutiny. Zero head-hopping; voice remains consistent even during high-stress transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("magnetic tendrils lashing the void like whips of ionized regret"). Final line’s "hushed and holy" recharges earlier ennui with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle—even complex metaphors ("absences shaped like words") serve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms immortality trope via cosmic-scale specificity: "resonance" of farewells feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk-taking (quiet climax without dialogue) heightens stakes through charged specificity ("liquid ink" shadows). Fresh synthesis avoids derivative middle-ground hedging.</comment>
