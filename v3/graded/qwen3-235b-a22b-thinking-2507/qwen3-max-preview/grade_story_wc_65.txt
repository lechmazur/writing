<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "once tried to force grandeur... and failed" versus current restraint; embodied emotion in trembling quill and "compression of all prior failures" avoids therapy-speak. Final glyph choice earns endurance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "compression of all prior failures, echo of abandoned drafts"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to humming parchment. Orientation clear by line 30.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain every choice (writing "within spire’s shadow, within the lake’s freeze"); final spire pulse directly charges closure. Tool (quill) and micro-setting (parchment veins) dictate tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (charting ignorance) tightens through glyph-by-glyph escalation; "compression of all prior failures" crystallizes cost. Agency drives every beat but minor tension dip when backstory interrupts present pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "Begin." glyph embodies innovation-through-constraint without moralizing. Final spire pulse reweights premise with conceptual cost ("misread maps... that was the point"), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "equations unfold... living threads of causality"; rhythm modulates from lyrical stillness to urgent glyphs. Zero head-hopping; non-standard punctuation serves voice-driven compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "sound like tectonic thought" risks mixed metaphor but pays off as intentional geological/cognitive fusion. Final line avoids cliché with concrete action ("earth itself had exhaled").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" transforms mapping trope via constraint philosophy; lichen/salmon glyphs ground abstraction. Risk-taking (writing as invitation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing science/poetry.</comment>
