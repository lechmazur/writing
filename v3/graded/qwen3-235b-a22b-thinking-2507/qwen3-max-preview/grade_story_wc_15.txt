<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (stitching fractures = rebellion) and micro-decisions (honoring cracks vs erasing), but "hauntingly optimistic" trait lacks active constraint on choices beyond thematic labeling; needle-scars imply cost yet emotional contradiction stays abstract during peak sewing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: plate’s pulse and star-rearrangement crystallize the shift from mending to remaking, with felt cost in ancestral scars and the canyon’s exhaling of "drowned lullabies"; Accumulative lens holds through stitching intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (labyrinth’s dream-paths guide movement) and charges closure (canyon walls shimmering with "ghostly tapestries"); red canyon dust, bone needle, and tide pools evolve causally—e.g., empty pools tightening the ritual hour’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (memory vs erasure) tighten through the sewing act, but escalation lacks a decisive pressure point; the grandmother’s "broken precedents" concept informs motivation yet doesn’t actively narrow options during the sewing climax—cost is resonant but not tactically urgent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the plate’s transformation: "broken precedents became sacred blueprints" reweights ruin as generative without moralizing; final image (child stepping out with storm) offers non-literal answer to "can collapse birth cathedral?" through earned action, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust that tasted of forgotten hymns," "ghost of salt on tongue") modulates under pressure; sleepwalking logic teaches the Accumulative lens early; no head-hopping as single POV voice remains coherent even during transcendent moments like the plate’s pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("thread curling like smoke around porcelain edges") advances plot and theme simultaneously; rhythmic control peaks in closure ("reverence grows best in the soil of ruin, watered by stubborn hope") without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of weaving as memory-repair transforms familiar tropes; "sewing memory into stone" feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry—though "orchid solace" borders on ornamental without deeper integration.</comment>
