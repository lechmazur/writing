<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her absorption of pain without drowning; final renunciation of the ring earns change through embodied micro-choices like translating widow's sigh. Flaws lack visible struggle beyond "did not flinch," slightly weakening cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stepping into silence reconfigures grief/joy with felt cost (leaving ring behind). Accumulative lens holds—each note deepens pressure toward the stillpoint’s conceptual repricing. No orientation debt; cost proof clear at "placed it on the moss."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest and compass ring constrain every choice (dowsing via vibration), charging the final image where silence absorbs sound. Micro-setting mastery: moss "chiming like glass bells" evolves into scattered embers, mirroring her transformation without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (navigating emotional depths) tightens through resonant breadcrumb notes narrowing options to the stillpoint. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves the ring, trading absorption for composition. Agency drives escalation—her "tuning" forecloses the path of passive translation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "grief and joy were not opposites, but harmonics" crystallizes in the stillpoint without moralizing. Final image of new musical notes growing from her "vowel shaped like gratitude" reweights the premise with earned ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: language absorption through skin creates rhythmic cadence ("pulsing like veins of forgotten speech") that compresses under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates from tactile precision to resonant lyricism as she composes rather than absorbs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "moss that chimed like glass bells" does triple duty (sensory, plot, theme). Figurative language ("lullaby older than stars") clarifies rather than obscures, though "veins of forgotten speech" slightly strains coherence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blind mapmaker premise transforms tropes via specific constraints (skin-language absorption, ultrasonic forest). Emotional truth anchors universals—"tuned not healed" avoids safety middle—though freshness leans more on execution than radical premise shift.</comment>
