<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete sensory choices ("measured epochs by curl of a leaf’s edge"), but peak epiphany ("mountain was a chorus") edges toward over-articulation without sufficient embodied struggle preceding it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: leaving the notepad open with "Add Your Texture" crystallizes the cost of relinquishing solitary practice, reconfiguring stakes through the trees shielding it from rain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fluorescent lamp functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure; its hum mapping "contours of foreign past onto her nerves" makes environment indispensable to the final image’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Discovery of "Someone else’s history" meaningfully deepens the dominant stake (collecting invented histories), forcing the choice to share the notepad with visible cost to her solitary practice under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of trees shielding the notepad offers non-literal answer to "Is art solitary?" without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the charged gesture of communal hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("bark’s whisper," "graphite ghosts"), with rhythmic compression under pressure ("Heart quickening, she flipped"); only slight tell in "earnestly studious" disrupts immersion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "stitch in time’s quilt" and "emotional topography" avoid muddle through concrete verbs; single deduction for "graphite ghosts" slightly mixing ethereal/tactile registers in one phrase.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Risk-taking elevates stakes: transforming "invented histories" into communal chorus via bonsai/lamp mechanics feels inevitable, avoiding derivative "lone artist" tropes through specific, verifiable detail like "Winter of Whispered Truces."</comment>
