<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elira's grief-driven quest shows embodied contradiction (cataloging anomalies while seeking the uncatalogable), with micro-choices like adding aster triggering pivotal change. Minor deduction: father's reunion lacks friction despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when Elira steps through the coffee-pattern doorway, with visible cost in suspended tears. Flawless Accumulative lens progression; whale's death slightly weakens causal link to chamber resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Salt chamber's gravity-charged crystals actively constrain choices (hovering dust, chiming transition) and charge the final image. Micro-setting of coffee grounds on copper plate drives the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (finding memory's location) tightens through Elira's agency: aster placement triggers doorway. Cost is visceral in suspended tears and whale's glowing bones. Perfect escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Memory isn't erased, it's displaced" emerges organically from coffee patterns; final jellyfish-like memories reweight the quest without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete brine imagery and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gravity pockets that fluctuated," "salt crystals spiraled like frozen chandeliers") with rhythmic control. Tension compresses diction during the doorway reveal while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "ribs arching like cathedral buttresses" shows textural specificity. Minor abstraction in "quiet, gleaming silence quest" slightly dilutes peak-beat immediacy despite strong coffee-ground imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through physics-poetry synthesis; coffee-ground divination feels inevitable. Risk-taking (gravity as memory storage) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in suspended reunion.</comment>
