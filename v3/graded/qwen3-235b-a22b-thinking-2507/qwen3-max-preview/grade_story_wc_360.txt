<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but abstract; "grief could be graphed" risks thematic echo without embodied choice. Final renunciation lacks prior causality—no visible trade-off when fragment dims. Micro-choices absent under pressure; warlord subplot off-page weakens relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: glyph meaning "beginning/ending/bridge" crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("mathematics still unsolved"). Lens (Accumulative) holds, but "collapsed empathy-space" mid-story infodump fractures causality. Cost legible via unsolved equations in final line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Topaz workshop refracts light beautifully but fails to constrain choices—no tactile pressure on typesetting. "Vanishing stars" timeframe signals urgency yet lacks causal clock (e.g., no dimming light forcing errors). Halo fragment charges closure as micro-setting but misses middle-beat integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping unmappable emotions) clear, but escalation lacks tightening: "last star vanishing" feels atmospheric, not earned narrowing of options. No visible price paid mid-story (e.g., fragment dimming should cost her a pamphlet). Warlord's change proves stakes but occurs off-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing; final glyph reweights premise with conceptual cost ("bridge" meaning). "Empathy without boundaries was erosion" shows earned wisdom through her storm backstory. Risks pseudo-profundity with "slope of a sigh," but specificity (violet ink tasting "salt and static") grounds theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "ink-stained fingers dancing over brass keys" embodies her craft. Rhythm modulates under stress (short warlord scene sentences). Slight register drift in "collapsed empathy-space" explanation, but voice coherence holds through lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "letters that trembled like heartbeats" avoids cliché. Minor overwriting: "habit born not of secrecy but of transposed empathy" bloats rhythm. No loops or scaffold, but "integral of a sob" strains metaphor past coherence in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress artistry and emotional physics. "Pamphlets find recipients" subverts distribution tropes organically. Weakness: "mathematics of emotion" borders on template, but specificity (clockmaker's gears, violet ink) transforms it into memorable vision.</comment>
