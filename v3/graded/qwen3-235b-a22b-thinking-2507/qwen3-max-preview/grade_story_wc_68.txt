<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "rational rebellious" actions (spitting at chants yet transcribing silently); cog-as-metaphor embodies motivation without abstraction; cost of endurance crystallizes in "footsteps silent on slick stone" as visceral forfeiture of community.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: water shifting in response to whispered coordinates reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("truth settles grain by grain"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sedimentary escalation where transcribing sewer patterns tightens pressure toward the sundial observation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sewer functions as active constraint—silt-choked stairwells force descent, floodlines dictate mapping tactics; the chronometer cog charges closure when placed on the bell, proving micro-setting necessity as the final image reweights the obelisk through submerged sundial shadows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through physical acts: Council bulldozing libraries WHILE protagonist transcribes erosion patterns creates tangible pressure; endurance as agency forecloses reintegration with cost in "footsteps silent," narrowing options to geological persistence under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars—the sundial’s underwater shadows moving beneath the steel obelisk offers non-literal answer to memory vs. amnesia; zero moralizing, with "truth settles grain by grain" earned through prior sediment imagery avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "abrasive calm" lexicon ("dismantling narratives with calibrated silence") and geological rhythm ("grain by grain") reflect his worldview; no filter verbs, with prose texture mirroring "patience of stone" even during high-pressure envoy confrontations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rust-pitted but still humming with latent precision" demonstrates high-density propulsion; only marginal deduction for "agonized—not with weeping..." bordering on telling, immediately redeemed by concrete tracing of tile cracks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms sewer-dweller trope through "inverted archive" reframing where setting IS the argument; the chronometer cog’s evolution from heirloom to methodology incarnate synthesizes character/world/theme with bold risk (geological resistance over revolution) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
