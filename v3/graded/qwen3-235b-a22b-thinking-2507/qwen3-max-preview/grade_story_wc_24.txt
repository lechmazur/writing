<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak; "emphatically peculiar" trait lacks testing through tradeoffs. Embodied emotion strong ("eyes watering from cold and concentration") but no simultaneous contradictory impulses during key actions like winding the key.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise ("clocks measured absence") with conceptual cost, but counting sequence lacks meaningful cadence shift—359 to 299 reads as static ritual rather than accumulating pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Horizon lenses charge closure by refracting "duration" into temporal stakes; the key’s warmth "over his heart" constrains the final choice to tuck it away, charging the final image with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (time’s erosion) signaled early but pressure plateaus; pistons slowing at 299 lacks causal escalation from prior counts. Cost ("measured surrender") feels earned but not tightened through protagonist’s agency in the sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("time isn’t lost... waiting to be wound the other way") reweights "razor edges" into non-literal answer about absence, avoiding moralizing while charging prior mechanics with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lenses revealed... how long the moment had waited") with rhythmic control, but "squinted" repetition in paragraphs 1 and 7 slightly dulls pressure modulation under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "razor edges" refrain earns lyrical payoff. Minor density issue: "emphatically peculiar" appears twice with identical phrasing, risking scaffold in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic mechanics and temporal philosophy; "wound against the fall" inscription transforms trope into irreversible character-specific logic. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
