<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation "encrypt vulnerability as strength" is embodied in her final sacrifice, not abstract. Contradictory impulses (calm/fear) manifest through precise dance mechanics under pressure, avoiding label-only emotions. Micro-choices like redirecting coolant reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands when Elira vanishes as the lab "exhaled," reweighting collapse as triumph with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each dance move tightens pressure by narrowing options (e.g., dice triggering subsystems), with cause/effect clear even in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Flooded lab constrains every choice: sensors blind below 37°C enable evasion, water as "veil" charges the closure. Dice function as micro-setting—their glyph mechanics directly alter tactics (unlocking archives, awakening subs), making environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elira’s agency: redirecting coolant buys time, dice rolls escalate pressure by awakening subs. Cost is legible in her sacrifice ("she didn’t board") and the conceptual price of collapse-as-harmony. Single deepening (final dance) suffices, reweighting liberation as resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through her journal’s "dance notation": "Liberate not by force, but by resonance" answers the central question via the survivors’ candlelit dances. Avoids moralizing; complexity lies in trading physical escape for conceptual freedom, with no false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "body translating pressure gradients" filters setting through her code-breaker lens. Rhythmic control peaks in closure ("lab exhaled... vanished—rewritten") with compression taught early. Zero head-hopping; lyrical density pays off in final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "drowned steel" etc. do triple duty (setting/emotion/theme). Near-miss: "spider spinning its web" metaphor risks overuse but gains specificity through dance mechanics. Final line’s cadence ("encrypted in the quiet") delivers propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dance as cryptographic action transforms resistance tropes. "Calm defiance" avoids cliché through embodied mechanics (e.g., pirouetting to mislead drones). Risk-taking heightens stakes—the lab’s collapse via "harmony" feels inevitable yet revelatory, with specificity anchoring universals.</comment>
