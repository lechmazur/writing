<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "blessed pariah" identity and refusal to flee, with embodied emotion in pencil strokes and compass warmth. Minor slip: grandmother’s "true north" epiphany edges toward over-articulation without sufficient struggle in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the vanished violet filament absorbed through witnessing, with felt cost in enduring isolation. Orientation anchors immediately; Accumulative lens holds as density of temporal distortions crystallizes her stance without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observation deck functions as active micro-setting: chilled glass enables sketching reference, temporal distortion directly constrains her artistic choices. The compass rose charges the final image as a tactile anchor against "echoed silence," fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (finding meaning in distortion) deepens through protagonist’s agency—sketching transforms confusion into exploration. Escalation via pattern break (violet filament) reweights cost, though its emergence slightly edges on coincidence rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "true north" evolves from relic to active curiosity, culminating in the resonant final image of "learning their new rhythm." Zero thematic echo; no moralizing, only earned subtext in charcoal strokes absorbing the anomaly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in artist’s gaze ("stars smeared like taffy," "teardrop of brilliance") with rhythmic control under pressure. No filter verbs; sensory details filtered through character-specific priorities. Minor diction drift in "residual chronal charge" barely nicks consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("stars wheeled overhead in slow, silent arcs"). High density with clear propulsion, though "temporally stretched" repetition in para 4 slightly dilutes peak-beat clarity without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-dilation trope through artist’s lens: distortion as "breathing differently" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional truth, with specificity (charcoal/smear imagery) making the fresh inflection inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
