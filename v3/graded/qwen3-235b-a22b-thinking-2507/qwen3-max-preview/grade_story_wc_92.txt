<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong micro-choices under pressure (aligning gnomon, timed steps) but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet "cradle of sparks" explanation feels external rather than embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "tinder was laid... timing immaculate" crystallizes cost while horizon "blush[ing] awake" reconfigures stakes; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation from "fading violet sky" to coded angles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (anchoring alignment, carrying vellum), charging the final image; fort's "arcane lanterns" lack spatial specificity affecting tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: blackout tightens pressure as guards pass "within arm's reach," making "misplaced stroke" threat viscerally felt; conceptual cost ("collapse into ash") unmistakable in mechanics of the act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "coded angles" as rebellion tools; final image ("baker... would understand") offers non-literal answer to "how does change begin?" avoiding moralizing while reweighting "silence" as weapon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "light bent through stained glass" and guards' "guttering" lanterns; rhythmic control peaks in "sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies" under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "slant of moonless shadow" does triple duty (atmosphere/action/theme); minor deduction for "dagger points/lullabies" metaphor tension in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution via geometry ("manifesto written in angles") with bold risk-taking; "calmly inventive" trait avoids activist clichés but "vigilant lock sentinel" title slightly tropey.</comment>
