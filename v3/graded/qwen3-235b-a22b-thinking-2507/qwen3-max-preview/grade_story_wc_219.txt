<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via concrete micro-choices: skeptic places amber not as offering but "coordinate," embodying her shift from data to convergence. No therapy-speak; embodied cost in "carrying not data but density" lands earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: leaving amber as coordinate forecloses scientific certainty while accepting ambiguity. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup; "wings catching last grey light" crystallizes conceptual cost without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tower/moss/footprints function as micro-setting constraining choices: roots splitting prints force cartographic adaptation, while bronze quiet permeates final image. Sensory hierarchy stays character-particular (ignoring ozone for "mother’s soap"), charging closure via iron-rich soil memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when spectrometer reveals "no anomalous compounds" yet pulse slows—proving homecoming’s chemistry is emergent, not molecular. Cost is academic identity: "carrying not data but density" forecloses her prior hypothesis with palpable weight in the final descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from amber’s evolution: from "control sample" to "companion" to coordinate. Final image ("wings catching last grey light") reweights "fossilized moment" into active convergence—no moralizing, only resonant charge from "time did not stop, but softened."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: academic lexicon ("ions realigned," "catalytic") bleeds into poetic precision ("lichen spelled out equations only the wind could solve"). Rhythmic control peaks in closure—"tower did not answer. It absorbed."—no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "bronze quiet" earns repetition through textural payoff. Final line’s "density—the weight of convergence" achieves maximum information density without muddle. One borderline elevated phrase ("fossilized moment") barely avoids overwriting penalty in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of academic rigor and pilgrimage via "fly amber as control sample" avoids trope clichés. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal beats) heightens stakes, though "luminous skeptic" borders slightly on familiar archetype without sufficient distinction.</comment>
