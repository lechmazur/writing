<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "active stillness" as embodied methodology; micro-choices like inverting assumptions reveal professional hierarchy of values when prying the ledger. Final verification inscription earns closure through prior causal work on the dry Master Index.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly; pressure escalates through discovered anomalies (sealed vents, ink-stained floors) narrowing interpretive options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with "warmed" ink stamp carrying undeniable conceptual cost of testimony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Sunken library actively constrains movement and supplies evidence: hollow pillars preserving the Master Index directly enable climax. Final "dappled resolve" reweights earlier lantern imagery into thematic charge without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "alternative hypothesis" method: grain shipment discovery deepens conspiracy from accident to intent. Cost crystallizes in "weight of what stillness preserved"—felt conceptually through testimony’s burden during ascent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Truth rarely roared—it seeped" avoids moralizing while crystallizing theme; final ascent reweights stillness as testimony without stated moral. Master Index’s "They buried us anyway" resonates as non-literal answer to origin-seeking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "shadows like hesitant thoughts" filters setting through archivist’s mind. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short sentences during water groans, complex syntax for analysis—without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prying it open with a bone stylus" shows high density. Metaphors serve purpose ("truth seeped"), no figurative muddle in climax. Final line’s "dappled with resolve" avoids cliché through specific context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist-as-detective transforms truth-seeking trope. "Stillness as sanctuary" concept feels earned through tactile methodology (ink stamp verification), avoiding safety-middle abstraction with bone stylus and dry ledger details.</comment>
