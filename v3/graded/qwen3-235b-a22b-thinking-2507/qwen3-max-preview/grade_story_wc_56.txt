<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not to retrieve, but to feel" versus instinct to salvage; micro-choices like angling the sundial for shadows (not time) concretely embody his patience-driven epiphany. No diagnostic label-speak mars the pivotal locket realization—cost lands through embodied action ("careful, almost reverent" scratches) not therapy jargon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the locket’s inscription reweights "lies" from deception to shelter with undeniable emotional cost ("unbearable weight of being known"). Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts (static hum to water’s exhale), and the sundial’s final placement as "measuring loss" proves persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—water stillness enables the sundial’s mirror effect, directly triggering the locket’s discovery. Sensory hierarchy ("lap of water," "temperature of forgotten time") filters through the seeker’s tactile obsession, charging the final image where the canal "cradles secrets it no longer needed to keep."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens: his "serene upheaval" training forces stillness until physics/patience align, narrowing options to observation alone. Cost crystallizes in the inscription’s sorrow—not physical loss but the unbearable weight of human frailty made legible through the scratched-out face’s careful violence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through architecture metaphor and locket’s physicality—no moralizing, just the resonant final image of twin relics "measuring light" and "measuring loss." The "serene upheaval" concept reweights prior material by revealing lies as structural shelters, avoiding tidy binaries through the woman’s sorrowful scratches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: the seeker notices "angles," not hours, and "temperature of forgotten time," reflecting his obsession. Rhythmic control under pressure ("static hums louder than voices... lap of water") modulates tension without elision issues. No dialogue present, but interiority avoids uniformity through concrete sensory bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture ("bruised indigo skies" conveys mood without cliché). Final line’s "thoughtfully clear" recharges the opening’s stillness with earned cadence shift. Figurative language ("stained-glass windows filtering harsh light") remains precise in peak beats, avoiding muddle while deepening theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "legend seeker" trope by making truth salvaged, not shouted—fresh through the architecture metaphor applied to emotional shelter. Specificity (sundial for "slant of regret," locket scratches as "reverent") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, passing the transformation test.</comment>
