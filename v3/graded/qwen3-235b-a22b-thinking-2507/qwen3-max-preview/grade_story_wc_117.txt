<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("anchor: magic didn’t shout"); micro-choices like passing the curl earn closure. Secondary characters lack depth (freckled girl’s motivation unexplored), slightly weakening the renunciation’s cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation flawless by line 10; Accumulative lens holds as eclipse pressure tightens. Closure (curl passing hands) reweights wonder’s nurture with visible cost: silenced phones, unasked questions. Backstory fragment stays anchored to hair curl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s junipers and "crushed sage" constrain Elara’s method ("no rigid playlist"); "dreaming roots" timeframe charges the final image where earth "remembered how to listen." Micro-setting (moss quilt, cereal-box viewers) drives tactile choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (nurturing wonder) tightens via eclipse pressure, narrowing options to shared stillness. Cost legible in grandmother singing "since her husband passed," but conflict lacks deeper opposition beyond atmospheric tension, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (cereal-box viewers, beetles scuttling), not moralizing. Final image rejects bottled wonder for "nurtured, link by link," but journal quote edges toward thematic echo, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("silence bent gently like reeds"); rhythm modulates under stress (short sentences during eclipse). "Softly adaptive" risks therapy-speak but stays voice-motivated. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density ("Birds paused mid-chirp") propels momentum. "Honeyed" chord slightly cliché but redeemed by context. Metaphors cohere ("coiled like a sleeping vine"), never muddying causality in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "healing music" trope via specific constraints (baby hair curl, cereal-box viewers). Risk-taking (quiet eclipse climax) heightens stakes, but "dreaming roots" motif lacks fresh inflection beyond lyrical resonance, capping near-band entry.</comment>
