<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hollow ache of a creature who had interiorized exteriors" versus swallowing landscapes; micro-choices like placing the pendant earn transmutation of homesickness. Diagnostic label "dimensionally homesick" slightly flattens embodiment early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "dimensional homesickness did not vanish. It transmuted" into a compass. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as swallowed landscapes deepen texture toward the statue's breathing ice. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Frozen garden constrains every choice—geometry tucked "beneath its ribs," mist coiling like serpents—charging the final image where "the garden exhaled." Hoarfrost on fur and pendant's thrum make setting a visceral pressure point, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "interiorizing exteriors" as the guardian swallows landscapes to prevent vanishing, culminating in the cost of transmuting homesickness. Agency drives escalation: placing the pendant reconfigures boundaries from walls to "membranes" with felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: swallowing deserts/cathedrals becomes "a compass," not a moral. Final image—"friendship forged in the quiet between certainties"—resonates without stating a thesis, reweighting uncertainty as warmth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: "glyphs that tasted like static and snow," "voice like pages turning." Rhythm modulates from fragmented waiting to flowing closure, with "foggy lucidity" woven into every sensory detail without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "thrumbing weight" to "lullaby" progression shows high density. Slight register drift in "dimensionally homesick" (label over embodiment) costs 0.1, but prose remains crystalline under pressure with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes through visceral stakes: "swallowing cathedrals built from silence" feels inevitable. "Boundaries of light as membranes" synthesizes cosmic horror and intimacy, with risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightening emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
