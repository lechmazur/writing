<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "sanely eccentric" motivation and the pivotal realization that she came to reawaken stories, not retrieve them. Minor slip: could deepen micro-hesitation before singing to heighten agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with visible cost: the scarf's transformation ("glowed faintly") and patrons sensing "warmer, heavier" pages. Causal lens holds firmly from search to reawakening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scarf functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (activation requires it) and charges the final image (glowing threads). Spatial choreography during tessellation transition lacks one precise detail for 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by librarian's agency: whispering the axiom narrows options to irreversible entry. Cost is unmistakable in the scarf's glow and her emotional labor ("remind them they were loved").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: patrons feeling "warmer, heavier" pages reweights analog memory as sanctuary. Avoids moralizing; final image non-literally answers "where stories live" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("equations disguised as sonnets") and rhythmic control under pressure ("It shivered. Not metaphorically.") are exemplary. Elision of backstory through scarf details is flawlessly taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density in activation sequence ("closed her eyes... whispered... stepped") is pristine. Figurative language ("folded like memory") never obscures causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry as narrative topology feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes: mathematical concepts become emotional conduits without abstraction or gimmickry.</comment>
