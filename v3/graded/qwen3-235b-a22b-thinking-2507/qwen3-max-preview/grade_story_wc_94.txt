<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("raw, yes—but also radiant") and embodied emotion shine, but micro-choices lack concrete pressure in pivotal beats; the envelope withdrawal reveals motivation yet doesn't escalate stakes through visible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"scars were not endpoints but waypoints" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (enduring vigil over resolution), and the Accumulative lens holds through storm-intensified density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (darkroom timer) constrains ritual and charges the final image—its "relentless cadence" shapes her "rarefied grief," proving environment isn't backdrop but active pressure in this Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via storm-intensified density narrows options to enduring silence, with cost legible in "scars as coordinates"; protagonist agency in refusing to open the envelope forecloses resolution under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image—"unredacted sky" reweights censorship as cartography without moralizing; the final line ("silence was enough") resonates as earned wisdom from concrete ritual, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("electric silence," "ink-stained hands") and rhythmic control under pressure are exceptional; compression ("rarefied her grief into ritual") is taught early and pays off in the vigil's crystallization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("quartz fractured to reveal its inner fire") slightly muddles peak-beat clarity, but zero loops and high density propel momentum; final line’s "silence was enough" exemplifies strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms censorship trope through specific cartography lens; "tear shaped like a question mark" synthesizes emotional truth and risk-taking, feeling inevitable in hindsight without derivative echoes.</comment>
