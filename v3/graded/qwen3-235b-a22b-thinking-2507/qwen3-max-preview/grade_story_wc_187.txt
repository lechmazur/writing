<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids abstraction through embodied actions like measuring shadows with empathy; micro-choices in kneeling and signing along raindrops concretize her preemptive nostalgia. Flaw: "emotional contours" risks abstraction but redeemed by tactile shadow analysis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the archivist’s descent crystallizes her future erasure with conceptual cost ("preemptively nostalgic for her own eventual erasure"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: shadow measurements deepen pressure until the final refraction signature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (kneeling to measure shadows) and charges closure (vellum "pulsing" with refraction). Fog-to-glass transformation evolves causally, mirroring memory solidification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: shadow measurements narrow options to one live path—sculpting identity from erasure. Cost is legible in "preemptive nostalgia" for her own disappearance, though external pressure remains atmospheric rather than interpersonal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shadow-length mechanics reweighted at closure: "short shadow" of Unfinished Questions reframes erasure as necessary. Final image (vellum "heavy with ghosts") offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stormlit sensory hierarchy (thunder as "drowsing beast," crystal "whispering" via shivers). Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented clauses during shadow measurements accelerate tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("rain had ceased hours ago, but the air still hummed"). Minor register drift in "emotional contours" (-0.2) but metaphors cohere ("fossils of feeling" charges closure).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "memory archive" trope through shadow-measurement mechanics. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens in short form) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the refraction signature feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
