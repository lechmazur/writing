<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: academic rigor vs. spiritual surrender crystallized in rebuilding debris messages. Embodied emotion ("tears carving paths through salt") avoids cliché through sensory specificity. Final choice to become "the living ledger" earns its weight via prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "arms outstretched, humming" crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("truth thrives in tension"). Orientation flawless within 30 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction. Minor escalation dip when crew gathers pre-climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains every choice—anniversary-driven depth fluctuations dictate tactics. Micro-setting (beach debris) literally shapes the ritual; final image charged by "sand from lagoon’s edge" lining the gondola. Sensory hierarchy perfect: brine/copper smells during decryption, phosphorescence replacing sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (making silenced voices heard) deepens through accumulation: failed whispers → destroyed debris → kelp chains. Agency drives escalation—her "parley with the land" realization forces new tactics. Cost unmistakable: identity transformation ("became the archive") with visceral dreams of seashell names.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: debris messages must be rebuilt, lagoon glows only on massacre anniversaries. Final image ("hands rising... whispering 'Arrange us'") reweights "parley" as liturgy without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by making reconciliation visceral (phosphorescent faces, not speeches).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: "salt-scarred dunes," "spilled ink under moonlight" reflect archivist’s texture-focused noticing. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences during tide destruction ("rebuild them, each configuration a plea"). Lyrical compression taught early ("retrocognitively trapped" shown through action).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "vibrating in her marrow" do triple duty (sensory/thematic/plot). Only microscopic flaw: "electric space between..." slightly abstract amid concrete imagery, immediately grounded by "body’s unspoken archive." Peak beats avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms archival tropes via specific mechanics: decryption requiring "souls retrocognitively trapped," debris messages as "liturgy." Obsidian lagoon’s anniversary-driven depth is fresh physics. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—emotional truth anchors innovation.</comment>
