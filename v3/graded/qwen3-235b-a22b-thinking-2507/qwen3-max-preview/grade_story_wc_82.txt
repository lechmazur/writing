<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; final choice earned yet monolithic in execution. Micro-choices absent during pivotal lantern-shattering moment weakens 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: sapphire's chord folding the world carries conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to "shadow softened, blurred" climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tea garden's thermals constrain crane flight ("flowing contrary to world’s logic"), directly charging the descent sequence. Micro-setting elevates to environment-as-character in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Silas' agency: gathering lanterns/singing dirge narrows options meaningfully. Cost crystallized in sapphire’s fall—"a chord that folded the world like paper."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final crane reweights grief without moralizing: "hold[ing] air still" answers central question through image, not thesis. Avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("gravity wept," "tea leaves stand upright") remains consistent under stress. No head-hopping; compression during dirge ("sang—not a lullaby") heightens pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "folding space as they folded air" demonstrates multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language never obscures cause/effect even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through specific mechanics: cranes descending while ascending reconfigures spatial logic to serve emotional truth. Risk-taking enhances stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
