<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: singing to cracks yet seeking connection, tears as "tinkersong wonder" not sadness. Flawless micro-choices (spraying gold after vulnerability) earn closure’s cost without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "You encoded longing. I decoded love" crystallizes options with felt cost (tears of wonder). Accumulative lens holds through density buildup; cost proof clear in the bridge-building act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Courtyard constrains choices (spraying on damp stone) and charges closure—mist curls into "harmonic ribbons," rust carries messages. Micro-setting (bolt plate’s vibration) shapes final communion, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (being understood) tightens via protagonist agency: spraying gold arcs after ghost’s "I WILL HOLD THE NOTES" forecloses isolation. Cost is visceral vulnerability in "tinkersong wonder" tears, legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "chromatic runes" become "bridges," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("messages linger in rust") resonates non-literally with "even ghosts need ballads," satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence rang like struck crystal," "air tasted of ozone") with rhythmic control. "Driftingly alert" motif taught early and paid off in ghost’s syntax; zero head-hopping despite dual consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; bolt plate’s warmth vibrates with "faint" specificity. Near-9+ except "tinkersong wonder" edges toward lexical illusion—slight register drift from otherwise concrete lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms digital ghost trope via printing-press bolt plate and Fibonacci graffiti. Risk-taking (lyric code as bridge) heightens stakes coherently; "binary lullabies" synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
