<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes through tactile revelation ("limit: not barrier but lens"), avoiding diagnostic labels. Embodied emotion in "laughed, softly, a sound swallowed by the hush" shows authentic contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "palms stained with charcoal and sky" + "no one would see this sky but her" reconfigures stakes through irreversible artistic transmutation against demolition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Coin's texture functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (brushstrokes from indentations) and charges final image ("star-charts only she could decipher"), meeting 9+ gate through causal pressure on the ceiling painting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tactile revelation ("discovered its limit") deepens knowledge, narrowing options to urgent communion. Cost legible in "palms stained" and erased art, tightening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "felt contours and called them truth" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("closed her eyes, and smiled") offers resonant answer to central question of perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in "fingertips grazing bark-worn shelves" and tactile astronomy. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("dawn bled through leaves like watercolor") to staccato ("She painted faster now") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "charcoal ground from burnt oak" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language serves pressure: "comet’s tail arcing" avoids muddle while advancing closure. Minor repetition of "fractally precise" justified by motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "doomed library" trope through face-blindness-as-lens. Emotional truth in "never loved a face, only the pressure of a cheek" avoids templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry via tactile cosmology.</comment>
