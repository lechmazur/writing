<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "survival wasn’t enough anymore" versus prior penny-poem pragmatism; embodied emotion in the fisherman’s knitting-needle exchange reveals character through micro-choice. Final renunciation (leaving jars anonymously) earns cost via prior causality of his sparse past.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the poet’s disappearance crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("gleaned from silence"), while the humming jars reconfigure meaning. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density increase in sound-capturing shards, taught by 25% mark with music box discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Jars function as micro-setting that charges the final image—pressing "ear to the right jar" at sunrise constrains choice and embodies the theme. Sensory specificity ("crackle of dry dune grass," "metallic ping of a bicycle bell") filters through the poet’s bias, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: "gleaned redemption" shifts from abstract to embodied cost when he leaves jars anonymously, narrowing options to pure legacy. Stake ("translator between generations") signaled early, with visible price in his death; pressure tightens through the schoolgirl encounter’s crystallized wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—knitting-needle rasp becoming lullaby—not moralizing. Final image ("translating between then and now") offers resonant non-literal answer to "how do we bridge loss?" avoiding thematic echo despite the poem’s "lonesome splendor" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: "spidery script" labels and "sonic reliquaries" reflect his trade. Rhythmic control peaks in the triplet "Gleaned from wreckage. Gleaned from silence. Gleaned from spaces between heartbeats," compressing stress without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "frozen mid-pirouette" and "tide-water in hollows" achieve high density. Minor register drift in "positively wistful" (final poem) slightly jars, but "mittened hands trembling" and "hollows" sustain concrete propulsion through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "bottling memories" trope via sonic specificity (gull cries, church bells) and redemption-as-gleaning. Emotional truth in the grandmother’s voice echo feels inevitable, resisting abstraction; "lonesome splendor" synthesizes loss/joy without hedging.</comment>
