<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "silent ache sharpened her focus" shows embodied contradiction. Micro-choices (light adjustment, logbook shift) reveal value hierarchy. Supervisor interaction slightly underdevelops secondary pressure, capping near-9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "she didn’t heal by forgetting... but by magnifying small kindnesses" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens. Dust pattern accumulation reweights stakes without causal breaks. Orientation clear by paragraph 1.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (angled lamp revealing patterns) and charging the final image ("let the light do the explaining"). File room specifics like "fluorescent hum" and shelf gradients avoid white-room syndrome while serving pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving loss vs. finding meaning) tightens through dust documentation. Agency-driven escalation peaks with Vance’s discovery, narrowing options to "documenting kindnesses." Cost legible in "years believing her role was to preserve loss" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button/handprint particulars; "sanctuary of examined unknowns" borders abstraction but final image ("point to the dust") avoids moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding love in "institutional indifference," though "unwritten anthem" slightly strains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices dust gradients and institutional neglect. Rhythm varies ("Dust, she’d learned, was never random" vs. lyrical closure). Supervisor dialogue functional but lacks subtext depth; voice remains cohesive under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tarnished infantryman’s button lodged in the crease" shows textural specificity. Final line poetic but not purple ("let the light do the explaining"). Slight deduction for "unwritten anthem" risking abstraction in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms foster care tropes via dust-as-witness mechanics. Emotional truth in "love persists, even in paper and shadow" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (elevating dust to protagonist co-conspirator) heightens stakes without gimmickry; premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
