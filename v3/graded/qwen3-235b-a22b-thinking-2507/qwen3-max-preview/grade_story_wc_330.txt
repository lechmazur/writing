<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shown through embodied action (sanding, silent singing) rather than labels; motivation "interpret silence as possibility" rooted in character-specific traits. Slight telling in "his motivation was not treasure" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: silence becoming "chorus" reconfigures meaning as sanctuary/salvation. Orientation clear by paragraph 2; lens (Accumulative/Textural) held cohesively. "Wrong turn" setup slightly convenient but doesn't undermine closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train constrains every choice (finding carousel, materials for work) and charges the final image (halo fragment spinning like "crown"). Micro-setting detail ("caramel ghosts," rusted ticket booths) evolves causally with plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("beauty left incomplete is a wound") escalate through density increase: mist thickens as he sings, culminating in carousel's movement. Cost legible in "bones hummed" and silence becoming song. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: final carousel movement embodies "silence, when tended... stitches wounds whole" without moralizing. Non-literal answer reweights "wound in the world" via shimmering wind bells' lingering note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("caramel ghosts," mist "like curious cats") and rhythmic control under pressure. Sentence variation accelerates during carousel animation ("One horse lowered... another turned"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere ("mannequin clowns with cracked porcelain smiles"). Figurative language purposeful even in peak beats ("silence became a chorus"). Minor deduction for "caramel ghosts" bordering on overwrought.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-creative-force through specific details (halo fragment as "sliver of moon," wind bells as harmonic partner). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
