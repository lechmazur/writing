<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in drumming as both suffocation and rebellion; final singing choice earned by prior micro-choices (rib-drumming, refusal to rest) with visible cost in "weary" smile. No diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: refusal to surrender memories crystallizes into wholeness through singing, with cost legible in "suffocating" prior state and "weary" resolution. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through rhythmic density buildup to singing climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choice (fractured reflection forces confrontation) and charges closure (light-tendrils lifting her). Sound wave garden actively responds to drumming ("vines trembled"), making micro-setting essential to tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single deepening suffices: drumming evolves from rebellion to communal weaving, narrowing options from isolation to integration. Cost is visceral in "suffocating" memories; agency clear in rejecting "calibrated peace" for self-directed rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through drumming-to-singing arc: "borrowed belonging" reweights into "weaver" without moralizing. Final image ("felt whole") resonates as non-literal answer to "loneliness multiplying," avoiding thematic echo despite high conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "auroras trapped in glass" and "melody bending like iron to magnet." Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress: staccato drumming beats shift to flowing closure cadence. Zero head-hopping in intense interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "mercury under constellations that blinked like distant monitors" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register risk ("hush of universe inhaling") justified by voice. Final line’s propulsion ("she breathed with it") avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms collective consciousness trope through drumming-as-weaving motif. "Borrowed belonging" premise follows implications without retreat; specific detail ("twenty-seven faces," "sonic sculptures") creates freshness beyond genre clichés. Risk-taking heightens coherence.</comment>
