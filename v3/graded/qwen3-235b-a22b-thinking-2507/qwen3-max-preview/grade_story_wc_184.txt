<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (methodical vs. intuitive) drive the rope reconfiguration; final choice to "weave silence into structure" earns cost through vanished door's tangible absence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via dissolving door and ledger note; cost is visceral (hinges vanishing) under Accumulative lens; lens inferred by midpoint via clock's rhythmic transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ceremonial rope constrains every choice: its braids dictate sequencing, and final image charges closure as "part of the mechanism"; sensory hierarchy (brass oil, uneven ticking) filters through archivist's occupational focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through archivist's agency: rope reconfiguration narrows options (only one sequencing works), with felt cost in the door's dissolution; pressure escalates via clock's cadence shift under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "fables of absence" become "pauses" only via rope reweaving; ledger note avoids moralizing by framing absence as structural necessity within professional practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("finger by finger, loosening knots"); rhythmic control accelerates during reconfiguration ("She didn’t pause"); no head-hopping in single-POV purity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("crimson, cracked, bearing the sigil") propels momentum; "confused by its own function" avoids metaphor muddle by grounding in clock mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "archivist" trope via specific rope-braid mechanics; "fables of absence" reframed as structural pauses feels inevitable; risks lyrical closure without sacrificing causality.</comment>
