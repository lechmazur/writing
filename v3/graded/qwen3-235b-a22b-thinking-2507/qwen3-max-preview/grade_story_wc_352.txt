<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism-mind flaw enables success but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; micro-choices (tracing sigil, whispering dialects) reveal value hierarchy with embodied cost ("breath caught"), though blind spots don't compound crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: gravity snap-back seals chamber with conceptual cost (physical access lost, knowledge portable). Causal lens holds perfectly through threshold sequence; memory flash vision paid off by sand-library revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices: inverted gravity enables floating silt navigation and upside-down bridge crossing; phosphorescent moss guides path. Final mist-curling image charges Seed's new role as portable vigilance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency-driven threshold challenges (water curtain → root bridge), narrowing options to location revelation. Cost legible in sealed chamber—knowledge preserved but physical vault lost—under Causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from marginalia motif; final line ("planning next reentry") reframes vigilance as cyclical duty without moralizing. Seed's purpose ("protect power from neglect") reweights prior actions as Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("synaptic thread glowing with clandestine luminescence"); rhythm accelerates during sigil chase ("carving path through mist like blade through silk"). Zero head-hopping; stress compression stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dust hung suspended like powdered stars" achieves triple duty (image, physics, tone). Minor register drift in "latent blaze" justified by context; final line maintains propulsion with "warm and whispering" Seed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden library" trope via marginalia-as-vigilance framework; gravity inversion enables discovery logic. Emotional truth in archivist's quiet triumph over spectacle—synthesis feels inevitable with risk-taking (threshold physics as plot engine).</comment>
