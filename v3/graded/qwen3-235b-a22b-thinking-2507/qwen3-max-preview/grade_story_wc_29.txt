<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cautiously hopeful" amid chaos) and embodied emotion ("rattled her molars") drive micro-choices; flawlessly avoids diagnostic label-speak under pressure despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis with visceral cost ("eyes locked on her oscilloscope as the signal writhed") under Causal lens; orientation anchors (radio booth/charts) established by line 3 with no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Astronomical charts function as micro-setting that constrains choice (cross-referencing coordinates) and charges the final image (new chart pinned); "cold coffee" embodies exhaustion without white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preventing societal collapse via frequency warfare) tightens through Elira's agency; cost is legible in her exhaustion and the tricksters' irritation during the signal retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("tuning a poisoned violin") not moralizing; final whisper ("Try me again") reweights "cosmic tricksters" with conceptual cost without stating morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in astrophysics lexicon ("subsonic frequencies vibrating beneath human hearing"); tense/stability flawless even during high-pressure counter-frequency threading.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "jury-rigged box of capacitors" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "cosmic tricksters" slightly generic but redeemed by concrete mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms first-contact tropes via subsonic frequency warfare; "psychological warfare dressed as cosmic revelation" offers fresh inflection with emotional specificity beyond surface novelty.</comment>
