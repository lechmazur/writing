<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Vael's trembling static-sensing hands versus transactional detachment; embodied subsumption ("wounded bird" metaphor) avoids therapy-speak. Final choice earned through petal's fracturing memories, though secondary pressure absent limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "lighter and heavier" cost legible when she smashes vials, with amber grotto's hum sealing her vow. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds via sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains choice—resonating walls force Vael's subsumption—and charges the final image ("silence thick as amber"). Micro-setting (blotter petal) dictates every action, dissolving into "marrow" for irreplaceable closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single stake (counterfeit vs authentic emotion) tightens via petal's "half-truths" deepening, narrowing options to destruction. Cost ("market will call her ruined") viscerally felt in blue-to-gold flames, though escalation relies solely on internal pressure without external complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through petal's dissolution: "half-truths" become marrow, rejecting moralizing for resonant final vow. No thematic echo; "broken feelings" reweights premise with conceptual cost while avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in static electricity sensing—Vael's tactile lexicon ("shards sharp, incomplete") modulates under pressure. Zero head-hopping; rhythm shifts from clinical precision to fragmented gasps during subsumption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "blue, then gold, then vanish" compresses action with strategic telling. Only minor deduction: "half-truths" repetition borders on thematic echo but earns resonance through petal's dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms redemption arc via static electricity method—specific sensory detail avoids trope. Risk-taking (no dialogue, single-scene transformation) heightens stakes, though "amber grotto" leans slightly on familiar magical realism tropes.</comment>
