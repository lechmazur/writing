<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("troubling serenity") and embodied emotion ("edges blurring into the garden’s glow") deepen single-POV baseline; micro-choices like laying the gear on petals reveal hierarchy of values. Lacks relationship crucible due to solo character, but generational reflection cleanly anchors present stance per BRR.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: gear’s transformation reconfigures "light" with conceptual cost ("peace felt fragile"). Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens held through resonant reprise of sonar pings. Persistent constraint (fragility of non-burning light) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nebula garden pressures choices (absorbs/whispers pings; petals as punctuation), while the gear constrains the climax (rust flaking enables transformation). Micro-setting integration charges the final image: "lighthouse without flame" reweights nebula’s illumination. Meets 9+ gate via tool-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: sonar pings accumulate echoes that narrow options toward non-calculating light. Cost ("peace felt fragile") legible in final beat. Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens, but lacks visible trade-off beyond conceptual fragility; dominant stake crystallizes cleanly without causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gear’s evolution: "You do not need to burn to be bright" crystallizes non-verbal answer to central question. Avoids moralizing via concrete particulars (rust flaking, bioluminescent moss). Final image reweights generational patterns as "melodies to be reharmonized," earning complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cathedral of gas and dust"; "slow seep of bioluminescent moss") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from languid ("petals fell in slow, silent arcs") to crystalline ("You are seen. You are not alone"). Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "rust flaked away like old skin" advances plot, character, and theme). Final line’s cadence shift ("nebula listened, and learned, and glowed") crystallizes closure without muddle. Propulsion peaks in transformation beat: "teeth began to turn—not grinding, but sighing."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic scale and intimate gesture (cradling gear like an infant amid stars). Transforms "light" trope via bioluminescent alternatives; specific stakes avoid generality. Risks lyrical structure but heightens coherence through recurring petal imagery. Lacks one radical premise shift for 9.0+.</comment>
