<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's "sensibly eccentric" motivation to seek where "explanations fail" drives every action; her micro-choices (kneeling, tasting water) reveal contradictory impulses—scientific rigor versus surrender—as pressure deepens. Final renunciation of the surface world earns cost through prior sensory immersion, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: stone sealing her path crystallizes irreversible belonging with visceral cost ("air alive, thick with musk"). Accumulative lens holds—each "hinged awakening" deepens surrender, narrowing escape until the lagoon's "taste of forgiveness" reweights existence. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lagoon's petrichor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (kneeling, wetting journal) and charges closure: "tasted of forgiveness" transforms scent from profession to spiritual homecoming. Sensory specificity ("ozone tang of unseen waterfalls") filters through Elira's expertise without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative deepening: Riel's terror → awe → surrender forecloses escape path. Cost is legible in "stone sighed, sealing the way"—not death, but irreversible choice to belong. Single tightening suffices; pressure coheres as scent/silence replaces logic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from petrichor's evolution: from "wet stone" to "breath of earth remembering its becoming," culminating in "belonged to the place where explanations fail." No moralizing; final image reweights prior material as resonant, non-literal answer to seeking truth beyond reason.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elira notices scent before sight ("mineral dampness shifted"), with syntax mirroring descent ("rope biting, breath shallow, heart steady"). Rhythmic control peaks in compass reading—"doors swinging open"—without elision; voice modulates from clinical ("psychometry read") to transcendent ("rewrote her sense of scale").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "limestone cliffs, fissure yawned" avoids paraphrase. Every line multiplies pressure: "dripped with patience of millennia" fuses time/sound. Closure beat ("stone sighed... sealing the way") uses precise verbs without figurative muddle. No scaffold—propulsion from first "whistle echoing like dying breath."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "lost expedition" trope through petrichor lens: Captain Riel's fate hinges on scent-based surrender, not danger. Emotional specificity ("terror of irrelevance, not death") avoids generic awe. Risk-taking (prioritizing olfaction over logic) heightens stakes without gimmickry; proximity to "stone breathes" trope is subverted by embodied stakes.</comment>
