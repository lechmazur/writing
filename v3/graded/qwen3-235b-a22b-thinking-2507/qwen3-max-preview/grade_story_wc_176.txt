<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "technically gentle" hands balancing precision with emotional vulnerability; "snowmelt ardor" avoids therapy-speak through concrete action like pressing card patterns "like a mother smoothing a blanket." Final renunciation—leaving unsigned work embedded in bedrock—earns visible cost through prior causality of casting labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: rope reconfigurations deepen pressure via density increase ("tug third braid... child’s giggle spills"), culminating in Charged Poise closure where "heart full of names" crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Orientation flawless—"icebound sanctum under aurora" anchors within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Aurora-illuminated ice sanctum actively constrains choices (permafrost preserves rope; ice-prisms refract light), charging the finale as "aurora dims... in benediction." Micro-setting mastery: beeswax and lapis bronze alloy directly enable the helix’s creation, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: selecting which rope braid to tug (Elara’s giggle) forces trade-offs in preserving limited names. Cost is visceral in "wept, not from grief, but snowmelt ardor"—the emotional labor of remembrance narrows options to "stop burying the past and start giving it breath."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "vibration" motif: bronze helix "pocked with perforations" becomes the non-literal answer to preservation. Final image of children hearing "great-great-grandmother’s lullaby" avoids moralizing while reweighting the core question—"not in vaults or scrolls, but in vibration"—with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ceiling glows like a bruise healing into dawn" filters aurora through artisan’s eye. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure—long ritualistic sentences fracture into stark declarations ("I lift it. A note blooms") during revelation. Zero head-hopping; lexicon stays grounded in craft ("tongs forged from cracked bell").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "furs stitched from wolf and weaver-bird pelts" compresses survival and craft into one image. Figurative language ("sky threading light through ice-prisms") serves momentum without muddle. Final line achieves maximum density: "walk toward rivers remembering how to run" recharges "sound of rivers" with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lost wax casting" into profound memory metaphor through specific constraints (glacial patience, punched card holes). Risk-taking in centering rope’s "hum" as active memory carrier pays off thematically; "snowmelt ardor" avoids cliché via physicality of "thawing tenderness" in casting labor.</comment>
