<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mended deception"—her pretended indifference masking fear while nursing wisteria reveals layered vulnerability. Micro-choices like tucking the snowdrop petal over algorithmic demands prove values under pressure. No stock phrasing; embodied emotion in "knuckles gnarled as old rootstock" avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: her refusal to replant forecloses institutional compliance, paid in isolation (intern's retreat) and physical toll ("rose stiffly"). Accumulative lens holds—firefly spirals mirroring marbles reconfigure reciprocity as visible, felt cost without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains every choice, from tourists' complaints to vines "rewriting the map." Final image of marbles glowing with "veins of gold" charges closure through environmental specificity—soil, cracked spheres, and fireflies become the story's circulatory system, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: intern's arrival crystallizes the garden's consent vs. compliance conflict, narrowing options to refusal. Cost is conceptual (her dead wrist-band, institutional rejection) but made visceral via the "warm" altar pulse—reciprocity over metrics paid in social exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "mended deception" and firefly spirals—no moralizing. Final image reweights "compliance" into consent via snowdrop petal tuck, answering "do gardens know gardeners?" with reciprocity's warmth. Avoids Thematic Echo despite intern's dialogue by grounding insight in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is soil-rooted: "fingers brushing soil," "damp earth and impending rain" filter all observation. Voice modulates under pressure—sparse dialogue ("It consents only to those who listen") contrasts lyrical narration. No head-hopping; vine's "shiver" stays anchored to her POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. "Dry sound like seedpods cracking" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line "blooming and withering in the same sigh" recharges marbles motif with rhythmic propulsion. No figurative muddle—every image (e.g., "veins of gold") serves closure's reciprocity charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "mended deception" transforms resilience tropes through soil-specific pragmatism (tea leaves, glued marbles). Avoids binary tech/nature clichés—she uses resin, rejects algorithms. Emotional truth in pretending indifference while fearing frost elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
