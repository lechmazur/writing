<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (precision vs. musical longing) manifests in tactile micro-choices like tracing score indentations; final hum earned through crystallized stance without epiphany clichés.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: humming forecloses path of silence-as-escape with visible cost ("ache of abandoned dream" transformed); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (softening clocks alters sanctuary acoustics) and charges final image ("crystal glowed" as catalyst for hum); petrichor nostalgia replaces generic weather tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: crystal’s vibration triggers harmonic shift, narrowing options to either reject or embrace transformed silence; cost legible in "ache" becoming "wonder" without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crystal’s transformation of silence into song; final image reweights "abandoned dream" as "composer of stillness" without moralizing—resonant non-literal answer to artistic loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (sound-as-tactile) persists under pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("silver thread stitched through glacial hush") avoids lyric dilution; no head-hopping in single-POV purity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn ("excruciatingly gentle" repetition) prevents 9.0; otherwise flawless propulsion where "droplet bloomed like ink" merges action/image without scaffold; final line crystallizes motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork precision and musical rebirth avoids trope recycling; "petrichor nostalgia" specificity transforms familiar artistic-blockage arc without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
