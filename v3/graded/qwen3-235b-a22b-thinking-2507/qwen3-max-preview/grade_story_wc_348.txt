<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied micro-choices: scooping foam dissolving "between her fingers—no residue, no regret" crystallizes earned transformation. Contradictory impulses (blaming scaffold vs accepting impermanence) act simultaneously in pivotal "phase change" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "grief that moved, that braided, that learned new keys" reconfigures options with visceral cost (tears as "part of the score"). Accumulative lens holds through river’s "symphonic chaos" deepening to "polymers blooming like lilies" in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Braided ravine constrains choice—foam’s dissolution directly shapes her polymer redesign. Final "liquid gold" foam image charges closure, fulfilling micro-setting gate. Chrysalis handled as recurring object charging three beats (discovery, notebook relic, swept-away release).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframing grief) tightens through river observation: "foam cells collapse and coalesce" shifts her from "blaming the hospital" to "graceful dissolution" design. Cost legible in changed tactics (sketching geometries vs measuring pH) and emotional vulnerability ("tears" integrated as musical element).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "scooped a handful of foam, let it dissolve" embodies "separation into connection." Final image of "polymers blooming like lilies" offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "bubbles popping like timpani" and "viola glissandi" refract river through chemist’s symphonic lens. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—"It was phase change. Transformation required rupture."—with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "river’s foam patterns" evolves to "fleeting geometries" without synonym churn. Final line "The chrysalis was empty. The music had just begun." achieves maximum density with propulsion. Minor repetition of "symphonically minded" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via polymer science: "scaffold that sang as it surrendered" synthesizes profession and emotion. Risk-taking in technical lexicon ("tensile strength," "phase change") heightens authenticity without obscuring clarity. "Watermark" metaphor avoids cliché through precise biological grounding.</comment>
