<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied choices like "sculpted patience from impatience—by witnessing, not waiting"; contradictions in "softly purposeful grace" versus "restrained wildness" manifest in concrete acts (kneeling on ice while empires crack).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "empires cracked like thin ice" crystallizes the revolution's success through the regime's silent retreat, with the mapper's whispered thanks reweighting the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary constrains choices (kneeling on ice, tracing constellations) and charges the final image ("mapped thaw with reverence"); the sextant and viaduct function as micro-settings that actively shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the mapper's agency (aligning viaduct with moon paths), but pressure lacks a tangible mid-beat reversal; the regime's retreat feels earned yet slightly passive, missing one visible tactical cost before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("mapped it... with reverence, with restraint") reweights "patient revolution" as organic unfolding without moralizing; the moon-path motif evolves from navigation tool to symbol of quiet resistance, avoiding thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in lunar-tide synced breaths and "frost etched with equations of calm"; rhythmic control under pressure evident in cadence shifts ("not conquest, not noise, not fire—"), with zero head-hopping in single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "brass sextant older than the regime she meant to dissolve" slightly bloats momentum; otherwise, zero loops and exceptional density ("frost spreading across glass, like silence deepening after thunder") propel the narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "revolution" trope through specific lunar/magnetic mechanics and the radical premise of power via stillness; "restrained wildness" synthesizes patience and rebellion into an inevitable, non-obvious emotional truth.</comment>
