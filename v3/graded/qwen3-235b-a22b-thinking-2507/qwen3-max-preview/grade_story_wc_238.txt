<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rebellion/remorse) act simultaneously when unscrewing the perfume cap; the annotated manuscript withdrawal earns reconnection with visible cost (coffee stain, smudges). "Regret" as early label slightly undermines embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "axes waiting at dawn" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost, while "flawed frequency" hum reconfigures their relationship under Accumulative lens. Midpoint lens ambiguity slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archive setting actively constrains choices (lamp clipped for currents, marble floor for tracked earth); final "orchard waited" image charges closure with visceral cost. Micro-setting (perfume bottle/lamp interaction) essential to mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through scent materialization: golden threads braiding his flawed symphony forces confrontation with imperfection. Cost unmistakable in "stumbled" rhythm and "cracked" smile; agency-driven via her generator setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through flawed symphony's "sour notes" and "cracked" smile—not stated. Final line avoids moralizing while "orchard waited" delivers resonant answer about necessary loss. Early "regret" label slightly mars purity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hush settled like dust over piano keys"); Elias' sparse dialogue ("torn sheet music" voice) contrasts her metaphor-rich narration. Minor generic tremor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "jasmine from his mother’s garden, vanilla from bakery" avoids sensory checklist through character-specific urgency. Final line’s "orchard waited" achieves crystalline propulsion. Near-flawless rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" transforms tropes via copper coils instead of holy water; "flawed frequency" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Orchard metaphor slightly familiar but elevated by technical specificity (induced currents).</comment>
