<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "corked, polite, productive" vs callings that "screamed in static"; embodied cost in sizzling tears and steam. Final renunciation of victimhood earned by visualization climax, no diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: dissolved portraits and cave's sorrow "gentled" to dawn warmth. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup; "single charcoal nub" reprise charges final image without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cave constrains choice (no lantern needed) and charges closure: crystal ground sizzles tears, cobalt quartz stalagmite anchors action. Micro-setting (charcoal nub) is indispensable—fits "like a bone" to release portraits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's mental visualization deepening pressure; "slow thrum of earth’s forgotten songs" tightens options. Cost unmistakable in sizzling tears and dissolved faces, reweighting stakes through auroral ink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: lock resonance mirrors cave carved by "water that refused containment." Final image ("creativity uncorked... chosen") reweights suppression without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence on father's cruelty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "boots crunching over millennia of fallen geodes"; syntax modulates under stress (fragmented "Then the second. Then the sketching begins"). Zero head-hopping, lexicon stays within artist's tactile worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "tears fall, sizzling faintly" multi-tasks atmosphere/character. Figurative language serves accumulation ("auroral sorrow" pulses as breathing grief) without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing journey" via geological creativity metaphor ("carved by water that refused containment"). Risk-taking in silent climax heightens stakes; "charcoal nub" reprise feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
