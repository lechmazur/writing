<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "illumination not exorcism" mission driving micro-choices like painting the question mark in "negation." Lacks one visceral detail of physical strain during possession to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly with "What if the assumption you hunger for... is that you're only one asking?" Cost legible in "walls peeled back like parchment" reconfiguring silence's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Palette's indigo weeping "sideways into fold of space" directly enables climax glyph. Final "silence deeper, richer" charges closure as micro-setting constraining choice through its architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when possession "hesitates" at rhetorical trap about ownership boundaries. Conceptual cost is perfect but lacks embodied physical price during climax under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Assumption's Veil" palette and final line "listening for spaces between echoes" answering central question without moralizing. Avoids all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: notices "static and old incense" not visuals. Rhythm shifts from "voice low threading syllogisms" to "scalpel wrapped in velvet" under pressure. Slight register drift in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silence clung like velvet moss" has tactile rhythm. "Conceptual repricing" phrasing in climax slightly jarring despite voice justification, blocking 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "battle evil" trope through rhetoric-as-weapon. Specific details like "cassock stitched from frayed audio tape" prevent abstraction while risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
