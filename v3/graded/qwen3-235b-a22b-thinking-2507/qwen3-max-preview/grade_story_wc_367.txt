<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("accidentally prophetic") shown via embodied micro-choices (laughter birthed omens), but motivation remains abstract ("quiet, stubborn will") without concrete testing under pressure; no visible cost escalation despite eternal burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis (eternal vigilance with "three hours of sleep" cost), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural pressure lacks deepening beyond density; stars' "urgency" doesn't alter her routine, weakening escalation under chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse constrains choice (spiral stairs carved from jade meteorite), while lantern wick charges final image ("shadow stretched... as invitation"); sensory details ("salt-slick cliffs," "dew from vines") filtered through her storm-attuned perception deepen atmosphere without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("steer the world’s dreaming edge"), but pressure lacks deepening—stars’ "unusual urgency" prompts identical ritual response, failing to narrow options or change knowledge; cost ("spent but smiling") is visible but not escalated by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "velvet night" imagery reweighted at closure ("light must dance with dark to be born"); avoids moralizing via concrete action (weaving stories "from salt and shadow"), though "stories older than ink" risks thematic echo without full integration into her struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("laughter ringing like wind chimes forged from lightning") modulates under stress; voice remains consistent through lyrical compression, though "drowned poets" in final beat risks ornamental abstraction without tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "inverted shadow, a darkness that illuminated" creates conceptual muddle; final-third artifact ("drowned poets") dulls closure image, disallowing 9+ despite otherwise controlled rhythm and vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "total internal reflection" as fate-bending method feels inevitable; bold risk in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "storm herald" archetype slightly dilutes freshness despite strong emotional specificity in "laughter seeding droughts."</comment>
