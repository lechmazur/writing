<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in sparrow rescue: urgency vs calm, embodied through "gently systematic" unwinding. Final choice to tie diary to branch earns closure through prior causality—his life’s work becomes living architecture. No label-speak; cost is visceral in "pulse fading into earth’s rhythm."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Arlen’s death crystallizes coexistence stakes with undeniable cost ("sigh lost in rustle of leaves"). Accumulative lens holds—each copper strand deepens the orchard’s meaning. Cost proof is explicit in the fading pulse merging with earth’s rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Copper wire constrains choices (dawn work, wire-tangling crisis) and charges closure via sparrows nesting in "copper arms." Setting isn’t backdrop—it’s active collaborator: moss-pulsed pillars guide growth, raccoons investigate tools. Final image reweights prior material through tangible ecology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Arlen’s agency: sparrow rescue proves "belonging in design," leading to doe’s birth in Spiral Stair. Cost is legible in his shallow-breath climb and dissolution into orchard’s rhythm. Single tightening (time running thin) narrows options to legacy-building, with death as unavoidable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: sparrows nesting in copper reprises "belong in design" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer—"learning respect by living inside the design"—rewighting Arlen’s work as living pedagogy. No thematic echo; cost is ecological integration, not sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is botanical precision ("grooves of diary," "scales like living coins") modulating with emotion. Voice stays within Arlen’s lexicon; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control peaks in death scene: short clauses ("breath shallow but steady") mirror fading pulse without abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "copper conducted intention" compresses theme into concrete action. Only microscopic flaw: "brazen calm" slightly abstract amid otherwise embodied prose. Final line ("tiny architects learning respect") achieves crystalline propulsion—no figurative muddle, pure momentum toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms terminal-legacy trope via copper’s botanical plausibility and "architectural secrets written in bark." Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes: death isn’t end but ecological integration. Freshness in sparrows as "tiny architects"—specific detail avoiding abstraction, inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
