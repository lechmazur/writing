<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via button cataloging as micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion in "calloused fingers" and "frozen in recognition" avoids labels. Lacks secondary character to test relationship dynamics per scope defaults.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: cliffs trembling from "unspoken choices collapsing" crystallizes conceptual cost of accumulated buttons. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density shift from solitary jar to multiplied echoes, though lens inference arrives slightly late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: resin/rust smells and slate trays constrain cataloging choices. Canyon echo jar charges final image when buttons "gleam under lantern light," meeting 9+ gate via tool-as-setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: "truth unraveling" pressure tightens via multiplying echoes and cliff tremors. Cost is conceptual (weight of choices) but lacks visceral physicality; escalation relies on density shift rather than narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button archaeology: "future is folded, like cloth" reweights prophecy without moralizing. Final image ("stitching tomorrow from discarded fragments") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question of choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "dust motes hung like suspended breath" filters world through turner’s tactile focus. Rhythmic control peaks in button cataloging ("scuff on enamel spoke of hesitation") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "whispering vortex" risks purple prose but avoids muddle via concrete payoff. Minor register drift in "archaeology of choice" (academic diction) slightly dulls pressure in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming prophecy via mundane objects (buttons as decision fossils). Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes coherently; "quietly inspired" reframes revolution as stitching.</comment>
