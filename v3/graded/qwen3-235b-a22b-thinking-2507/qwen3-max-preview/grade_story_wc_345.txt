<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limited on-page character depth due to scope, but Kael/Liora’s micro-choices (tracing chalk, clasping hands) reveal values under pressure. Elira’s ghostly agency avoids sentimentality through "resonance not manipulation," though interior contradiction lacks granularity. "Brace for trust" line shows earned relationship dynamics within tight word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stepping toward the nebula crystallizes stakes with cost legible in "orchard sighed—not in loss, but in pride." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through bell-ringing crescendo; orientation anchored by "dew-slick moss" and "twin moons" within 50 words. No causality breaks despite mosaic-like compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Petrified root-veins constrain chalk messaging; the bell’s "humming with latent rain" charges the climax. Sensory details ("sapphire, amber, void-black butterflies") reflect urgency while avoiding checklist. Final image—fading chalk, sleeping bell—reweights the nebula’s promise through setting specificity. Orchard’s "sigh" embodies cost without abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through collective agency: chalk messages narrow options to bell-ringing, with cost paid in the orchard’s "pride" (not loss). Escalation driven by Elira’s orchestration—Kael’s bell lift shifts from hesitation to action. Nebula’s arrival hinges on unity, avoiding coincidence; the "brambled but blooming" hope embodies trade-offs between risk and sanctuary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "reexamined hearts" and "walking together," avoiding moralizing. Final line—"the nebula would remember"—resonates as non-literal answer to "strangely trustworthy" premise. Cost in the orchard’s sigh rejects simplistic binaries; "brambled hope" embraces complexity without false equivalence. No thematic echo despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "whispers didn’t echo; they rooted" reflects Elira’s spectral logic. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during bell-ringing ("He rang it once. A chime like liquid glass...")—avoids syntactic monotony. Voice modulates from lyrical ("gravity-marbles") to urgent ("Ring it when the third moon blushes"), with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "spectral tears—the only substance that didn’t corrode its magic" exemplifies high-density prose. Final line’s cadence ("it would remember. As would they") avoids overwriting while charging closure. No figurative muddle—"nebula pulsed gently, a lullaby written in cosmic dust" serves momentum. Opening/ending motifs interlock without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s upside-down trees transform "refugee sanctuary" tropes through "floating rock arches" and "seed-song." Chalk messages as orchestration method feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Emotional specificity in "Elders carried baskets of seed-song" avoids generic hope; risk-taking (ghost POV) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Derivative guardrail cleared via lived detail.</comment>
