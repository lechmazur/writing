<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("survival was subtraction") and embodied emotion ("grit of ash clinging") power micro-choices like tracing ledger lines. Final renunciation of false urgency for "the pause" is earned through frost pattern accumulation with visible cost of silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("she lived in the pause") crystallizes stance with undeniable cost: the ledger's transformation from guilt to survival map reweights the premise. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—frost patterns accumulate pressure toward synchrony revelation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Canyon functions as micro-setting constraining choices: wind/water sculpting mirrors her adaptive process, while frost patterns directly charge the final image ("glass sang back to the world"). Sensory details like "grit of ash" filter through artist's tactile POV without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose in pauses) tightens through protagonist's agency—daily frost study leads to synchrony discovery. Cost is legible in "subtracting noise" and shattered glass fusion, though smugglers' "mercy" revelation edges toward convenient coincidence rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "purpose wasn’t a destination—it was the act of retracing" reweights loss through concrete particulars (frost glyphs, ledger strips). Final image of glass singing "drifting resonance" offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glass artist notices "crystalline filigree" and "spectral alphabets." Rhythmic control shifts from meditative ("night breathe through her") to urgent ("trembling") during synchrony reveal. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via ledger/frost parallels.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose sings with textural specificity ("ghost-gray ink," "vanishing lace of morning frost") but minor scaffold: "drifting resonance" repeats verbatim in paragraphs 10 and 14. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet prevents 9.0 despite exceptional density and rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms survival tropes through artist's unique lens: "scorched testament" reframed as adaptive blueprint. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—frost patterns feel inevitable in hindsight. Avoids abstraction via concrete "spectral alphabets" and "ash-grit" specificity.</comment>
