<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped; his "arithmetic" motivation for guiding the girl lacks contradictory impulses during the act itself, reducing emotional complexity at the pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly—the caretaker's refusal to escape crystallizes with conceptual cost in "assembling tomorrow’s invisible path," though the frost deadline's tactical pressure isn't fully leveraged for escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the nut charges the final image as the girl carries it out, but the labyrinth environment never constrains choices—the "safe corridors" are pre-mapped, missing the 9+ gate's requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly around the frost deadline and ghost chorus, but the guidance method executes flawlessly without visible trade-offs or tactical costs, missing the 8.8+ requirement for a price that alters later moves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of resignation-as-survival emerges organically through "offhandedly exact" actions, but the final image doesn't reweight the premise with a non-literal answer—resignation is confirmed, not reconfigured, failing the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("brittle shale," "candle smoke"), but "graceless beauty" feels authorial rather than character-particular, slightly fracturing POV consistency under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sun bled orange into violet" exemplifies textural density. One hairline flaw: "gears whirring in mild confusion" anthropomorphizes beyond the caretaker's observed reality, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh inflection in bureaucratic purgatory framing ("arithmetic" motivation), but the cursed-orchard premise leans on familiar tropes without sufficient transformational risk-taking to hit 9+ band.</comment>
