<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; her static covenant devotion prevents visible internal conflict despite embodied emotion in dust-brushing micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the ghost’s grateful gaze crystallizes her endurance with conceptual cost ("honey-gold glyphs" reconfiguring silence), though escalation lacks meaningful tightening beyond atmospheric density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned hives actively constrain choices (shielding box in storms); final glyphs charge closure by transforming setting into thematic language, fulfilling micro-setting gate for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("preserve weights") without on-page testing; no escalation beyond cumulative atmosphere despite coherent Accumulative lens, failing band guardrail for visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ghost-reading mechanics; final glyphs offer non-literal answer to "unsaid words" without moralizing, though secondary stake ("covenant") lacks interweaving depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tranquilly perceptive" filtering ash/light) sustains rhythmic control; voice modulates pressure via cadence shifts ("wind dared whisper") without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cobalt, amber, emerald" demonstrates high-density specificity; final line’s "honey-gold glyphs" achieves propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via beekeeping specificity ("whispered secrets to queen bees"); emotional truth in "weights of silence" avoids abstraction, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety.</comment>
