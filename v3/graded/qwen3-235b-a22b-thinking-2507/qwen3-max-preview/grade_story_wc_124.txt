<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through scent-triggered memories; micro-choices like trembling vial opening reveal contradictory impulses between fear of beauty and need to remember. Final renunciation of isolation earns closure with felt cost in "grief is its curator." Only slight deduction for minimal external stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: stepping into dusk with UV-charged lanterns crystallizes stance shift with undeniable cost ("absence becomes a second skin"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density escalates to glyph revelation. Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in final image's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice: skeletal vines trigger grief, UV lamp enables glyph revelation. Final image ("crystal shadow trailing like a loyal hound") charges closure through object-as-setting. Perfect sensory hierarchy—crisis narrows to perfume vapor while calm moments admit moss-stained tiles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: uncorking vial deepens knowledge, UV beam triggers glyph revelation. Dominant stake (fear of beauty's piercing joy) forecloses isolation with cost ("second skin" of absence). Purely internal conflict weakens stakes slightly, but Accumulative pressure intensifies relentlessly toward Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: UV-revealed glyphs make grief's guardianship visceral. Final image ("broker not just light, but remembrance") offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Minor deduction for "grief is not the enemy" phrasing bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fingers brushing glass panes as if tracing ghosts" filters setting through scent-based profession. Rhythmic control under pressure ("avalanche of memory: mother’s humming...") avoids syntactic monotony. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from wistful to resolved.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "glowing glyphs emerged—tiny, cursive, ephemeral" achieves high density without muddle. Final line recharges "crystal shadows" motif with propulsion. Only hairline slip: "marrow of moments" slightly abstract in peak beat, but redeemed by immediate concrete glyphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>UV-revealed memory glyphs transform familiar grief premise through specific mechanics. Synthesis feels inevitable: aromatically cautious trait enables glyph revelation. Avoids sentimentality via "second skin" cost. Slight deduction for greenhouse setting bordering on symbolic convenience, though redeemed by causal pressure.</comment>
