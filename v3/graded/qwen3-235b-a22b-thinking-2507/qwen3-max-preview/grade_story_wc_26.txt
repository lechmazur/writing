<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation to preserve hope’s texture is embodied through the river stone’s physicality and her micro-choices (e.g., weeping at the shadow’s metamorphosis). Interior contradiction shines in "not for loss, but for resilience," avoiding abstract epiphanies. Slight abstraction in philosophical moments prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: "luminous regret of what was lost—and the quiet triumph of what refused to die" crystallizes cost through conceptual repricing. Accumulative lens holds via shadow’s evolving manifestations. Orientation is anchored in first sentence; cost proof evident in "threaded with luminous regret."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (embedded to alter dreams) and charges the final image. "Petal-chandeliers drifted on thermals" filters environment through Elira’s preservationist bias. Every sensory detail (velvet moss, lavender soap) pressures stakes without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via Elira’s patient shadow-hunting deepens the dominant stake (authentic hope vs. curated euphoria). Her agency—embedding the stone—narrows options with conceptual cost: dreams gain "wind’s bite" but lose seamless euphoria. Cost is unmistakable in "luminous regret" reweighting the closure image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through the shadow’s metamorphosis into "thread of silver," avoiding moralizing. The final image—"luminous regret of what was lost—and quiet triumph of what refused to die"—offers resonant, non-literal answer to hope’s evolution. No thematic echoes; complexity lives in "trembling courage" vs. "gentler" hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "fingertips brushing spines that pulsed like heartbeats" reveals Elira’s tactile preservationist lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly from lyrical ("bruised violet and ember") to urgent ("Slowed it. Zoomed."). Zero head-hopping; voice remains embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dreams flickered—subtly, almost imperceptibly" uses em-dash for breathless momentum. Every line multiplies pressure: "static of collective memory" subtly conflates noise and erasure. Near-mixed metaphor ("luminous regret") elevates rather than muddles, charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "memory preservation" trope via neural lace mechanics and shadow-as-hope’s-chrysalis. The river stone’s specificity (dredged from pre-cloud world) creates freshness; "luminous regret" reconfigures euphoria’s cost. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
