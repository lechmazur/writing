<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "favored listening over noise" versus siren reliance, but Earned Stasis lacks visible cost escalation beyond restored trust; micro-choices during rope calibration reveal values, yet flaw integration remains slightly abstract without compounding errors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "restored trust" crystallizes the conceptual cost with undeniable pressure, while Accumulative lens holds through microclimate data accumulation; orientation anchors by word 10 and "zero hour" tightening reweights stakes with felt consequence in the bell's resonant toll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mountain's microclimate functions as active constraint—dew-point dips and ion surges directly shape sensor calibration tactics, charging the final image where raindrops "kiss soil" as promise; sensory details filter through the tester's professional urgency without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation via calibrated sensor adjustments testing the "3.2 knots" threshold, but the storm's arrival leans slightly situational; dominant stake ("listening over noise") tightens through the rope's tremors, with cost legible in the villagers' transformed perception of the bell's meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell's reconfigured meaning—from "dormant serpent" to "blessing"—avoiding moralizing while offering resonant answer to "fear versus faith"; "restored trust" crystallizes conceptual cost without abstraction, though "solstice hush" risks near-tautology in final lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in "barometric levers, thermal threads" lexicon reflecting the tester's expertise, with rhythmic control modulating during calibration ("humming... harmonized with wind"); single-POV stability anchors all description, though "credibly curious" momentarily drifts toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised purple and silver" clouds risk cliché but gain specificity through "bellies heavy with unshed rain"; propulsion stumbles slightly in "seventeen years—not since the Great False Dawn" transition, where reflection dilutes immediacy without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms storm-warning tropes through microclimate precision and the bell's reweighted symbolism; "calibrated triggers" and "ion surge" details feel lived-in, though "solstice hush" proximity to seasonal clichés slightly undermines freshness despite contextual integration.</comment>
