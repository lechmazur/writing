<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "expectantly resigned" lived through micro-choices (humming alone, not turning at creak). Closure choice to teach again earns cost via visible vulnerability meeting the girl's frayed backpack strap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density escalates through dust motes, leaf descent, creaks until Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes in the girl’s hesitant admission against Elara’s "traveled stillness"—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet library actively constrains choices: drapes absorb noise enabling "subtraction," rosette anchors final lesson. Final maple leaf trembling charges closure by mirroring Elara’s endurance—micro-setting essential to stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmony vs. world’s dissonance) signaled early; deepening via creak-to-voice progression narrows options. Cost is visceral: girl’s "I don’t know how to sing" against Elara’s life work—agency in teaching choice forecloses solitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "subtraction" evolving from humming to philosophy. Final line "harmony was never lost. Only waiting" reweights premise without moralizing—avoids thematic echo via concrete stakes (rosette’s silent purpose).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: Elara notices vibrations, wood grains, vocal textures. Sentence rhythm breathes with emotional intensity (lyrical memory → staccato creaks). Girl’s dialogue distinct via "frayed backpack strap" vulnerability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "velvet dust on skirt" shows not tells. Only hairline flaw: "denoted purpose" slightly academic but justified by musicology. Final line’s rhythmic charge ("Only waiting") perfects propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms choir-teacher trope via specific details (zither rosette, unlearning harmony as survival). Emotional truth in "expectant resignation" avoids sentimentality—fresh angle: harmony as subtraction, not addition.</comment>
