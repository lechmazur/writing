<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action: "fingers curled around cold brass," not labeled fear. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. calcified purpose) drive micro-choices like the drunkard stumble. Motivation—capturing trust’s sound—is embodied through fob use, avoiding abstraction. No diagnostic labels; flaw is minimal abstraction in "sound of trust breaking" as goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: trust shatters via Marla’s frozen exhale and Chain’s retreat, with cost in the hollow silence. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density buildup. Orientation clear by line 3 ("beneath Pier Seven"). Persistent constraint (fob’s history) shapes tactics and final image. Cost unmistakable in "silence after Marla’s exhale."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Pirate market isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices: singing eels mask approach, moth-eaten sails provide cover. The fob (recurring object) constrains the climax (brushing Marla’s wrist) and charges closure (tick synced to pulse). Micro-setting details like "glow-worm gin" serve urgency, avoiding genericism. Meets 9+ gate via object charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (breaking truce before sunrise) tighten through daughter’s agency: false starts buy seconds, fob deployment narrows options. Cost is conceptual—irreversible trust collapse—legible in the silence. Escalation driven by Accumulative lens: sensory density peaks at recognition. Minor flaw: "sunrise" timeframe’s urgency slightly undersold versus tide motif.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: trust breaks via silence, not violence. Final image (walking backward into dark) reweights "truce of hush" as fragile, with cost in the hollow click. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in "recognition" over redemption. Perfectly fulfills 9+ quick test: resonant answer to "sound of trust" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices fob’s "ghost-tick," not ambient noise. Rhythm modulates under pressure—"Then—a false start"—compresses syntax. Voice stays within POV lexicon ("fillet hope," "drowned men’s nets"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during fob press to ear. Elision (backstory via fob) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via varied syntax ("lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies" to staccato "She didn’t speak"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("chain coiled like a sleeping serpent"). Final line ("Sunrise would come") recharges fob’s tide symbolism without muddle. Peak beats avoid therapy-speak; "brittle snap" metaphor clarifies cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms smuggler trope via "truce of hush" concept and silence-as-weapon climax. Specific details ("crab-claw ink tarot," "bottled ghosts") feel lived-in, not quirky. Risk-taking (lyric structure, no physical confrontation) heightens stakes coherently. Fresh inflection: trust shatters through memory, not violence. Fits 9+ quick test with inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
