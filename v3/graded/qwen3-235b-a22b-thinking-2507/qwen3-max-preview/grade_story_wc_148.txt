<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on poetic abstraction ("noose of mistrust") over character-specific contradictions; embodied micro-choices during lattice removal show strong pressure response but final renunciation lacks layered trade-offs beyond singular determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves resonant Charged Poise ("lighthouse never lies") with conceptual cost, but "before they find bodies" threat remains undeveloped stakes; Accumulative lens holds though search party arrival feels perfunctory rather than tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lattice constrains key choices (wedging into mechanism) and charges final image (trapping voices in glass); reef setting pressures climb ("slick stone, through barnacle") while "copperlight repose" evolves from atmosphere to thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (validating silenced) but external threat ("bodies") never materializes; pressure tightens through sensory density though visible cost (being called mad) lacks tangible consequence on tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing via action-driven resonance; "truth made luminous" reframes premise through lattice's transformation without stated morals, though "unsilenced truth" borders on abstraction in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("groaning like a throat that hadn't spoken since '37 storm") and rhythmic control during light-fracturing scene; zero head-hopping with intentional psychic distance shifts under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "shroud of quiet triumph" slightly overstates but maintains lyrical propulsion; information density flawless except minor metaphor tension in "truth bled from lips" / "truths buried under laughter" repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "cry wolf" archetype into systemic silencing metaphor; "copperlight repose" and luminous truth feel fresh yet inevitable, though lighthouse-as-prison echoes familiar gothic tropes without full conceptual novelty.</comment>
