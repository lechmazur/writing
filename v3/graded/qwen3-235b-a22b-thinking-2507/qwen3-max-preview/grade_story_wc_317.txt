<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aris' porous receptivity versus methodical patience; micro-choices like kneeling nightly reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation of blooming as closure feels earned through soil-braille tactile detail. Lacks secondary character pressure but excused per single-POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: journal line reweights premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("never meant to flower"). Accumulative lens holds from "flowed like dreams" onward, pressure coheres through sensory density. Cost legible in final burial image; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brook soil functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (kneeling, cracking) and charges closure (journal buried there). Sensory hierarchy masterful—"whisper of reeds" filtered through innovator's stillness focus. Final image's moss and earth make environment indispensable to charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early: safeguarding grotesque innovation. Escalation via Aris' agency—designing rooms, nightly vigil—deepens under Accumulative lens. Conceptual cost unmistakable in journal's reframing, though visceral cost slightly abstract. One tightening (seed sprouting sideways) sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through corpse flower's biology (rot/bloom paradox), not moralizing. Final line offers resonant non-literal answer to innovation's purpose, reweighting all prior material. Avoids thematic echo; "mystery was the mechanism" insight earned through Aris' decades of waiting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystalline: innovator's focus on "damp earth decay" and "molars vibrating" from stem hum. Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("moonlight like liquid mercury") to staccato during sprouting. Zero head-hopping; tense/distance stable through lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "obsidian-black veined with crimson" shows textural specificity. Sentence rhythm accelerates during sprouting ("grew sideways—downward—spiraled"). Minor overwriting in "hymn/cathedral" metaphor but pattern-paid by willow's recurrence; closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "mystery object" trope through corpse flower's biological specificity (decade dormancy, putrid bloom). Emotional truth in innovation's slow rot-to-rebirth cycle feels fresh. Risk-taking in conceptual closure ("never meant to flower") heightens stakes without gimmickry; hindsight inevitability flawless.</comment>
