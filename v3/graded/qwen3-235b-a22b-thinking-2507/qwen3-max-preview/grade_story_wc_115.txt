<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. seeking truth) drive micro-choices; the final pocketing of the radio earns closure with visible cost ("weight had shifted. Settled. Become hers to carry"). No diagnostic labels, embodied emotion in "drowsy alertness" and valve-touching moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "dust falling like silent applause" crystallizes the cost of carrying truth, with the valve twist reconfiguring meaning under accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 3; lens holds consistently with density increase toward "mind’s machinery grinding backward" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The valve wheel constrains choice (kneeling, twisting) and charges the final image ("dust falling... silent applause"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: "boots scuffed echoes" narrows to tactile valve details under stress, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through psychological deepening: the radio discovery forces reevaluation of "ghost shift" as internal machinery. Cost is unmistakable in "weight had shifted. Settled. Become hers to carry," driven by her agency in twisting the wheel under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image reweights "swallowed truth" into "regurgitated, examined, carried forward" without moralizing. Theme emerges from valve/radio particulars: "ghost shift" reframes guilt as psychological rewinding, avoiding thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness that clung like static") modulates under stress; rhythmic control in "machinery groaning back to life without power, looms clattering like chattering teeth." No head-hopping; free indirect style clean in radio recognition beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issue: "guided by grief and the drowsy alertness of someone trying to wake up inside her own skin" slightly overwrites. Otherwise, propulsion in "she dug it out, battery corroded but somehow still whispering" with zero loops; closure image crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through psychological specificity: "ghost shift" as "mind’s machinery grinding backward" feels inevitable. Risk-taking in radio twist avoids gimmickry; emotional truth in "truths once swallowed must be regurgitated" elevates beyond familiar guilt narratives.</comment>
