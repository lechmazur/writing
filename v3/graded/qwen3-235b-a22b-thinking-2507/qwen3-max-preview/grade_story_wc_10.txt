<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction weakens 9+ eligibility; micro-choices like warming the fork against her wrist reveal character under pressure, but grief/resolution lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "her skin heard" crystallizes the cost of permanent sensory shift with undeniable conceptual weight, while the Accumulative lens (thermal mapping intensification) holds through dawn’s symphony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory constrains every choice—frozen fountain transmits vibrations, thermal zones dictate fork selection—and charges the final image ("hummed—silent, radiant"), satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: each fork strike narrows options by deepening emotional thermals, with cost (permanent muteness/shifted perception) legible in "She didn’t need ears anymore," scaling perfectly to the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("laughter fossilized in frost"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights silence as "presence of everything noise drowned out," offering a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress compression ("She wept—not from sorrow, but marvel"), with rhythmic control tightening during high-pressure beats; no head-hopping despite single-POV intensity under extreme conditions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle geometry of ice-limned glass panes" demonstrates high density without muddle, while final line’s cadence ("Neither was she") delivers propulsion without sacrificing clarity in peak resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thermal physics and lyricism transforms apocalypse tropes; "unshaken marvels" reframes silence through specific, verifiable detail (vibrational ice fractures), with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
