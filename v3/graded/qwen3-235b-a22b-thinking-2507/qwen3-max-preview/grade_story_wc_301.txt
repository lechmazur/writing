<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "daringly methodical need" clashing with "jagged bursts" of clarity; embodied weeping at "Maps lie unless you draw them bleeding" earns endurance with visible cost. Misses 9.0 quick test by lacking explicit hierarchy of values in final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly under Accumulative lens: "ivy slightly rearranged" crystallizes shift with undeniable cost in "raw solace of someone finally touching the wound." Persistent constraint (ivory archive) shapes final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Station functions as micro-setting that charges closure—ivy's "slight rearrangement" embodies healing, while rusted faucet and porcelain sink directly enable pivotal graffiti discoveries. Constrained choice via "tendrils like script" reading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness stake deepens through agency-driven graffiti discoveries, narrowing options from "compass" to "wound-touching" weeping. Cost legible in physical tremors ("bellows taped and trembling") but conceptual price slightly oblique in final resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "river chronicler" as penance reframes forgiveness via waterways' "grammar of flow." Final line—"scribbled in bathrooms, stitched with tape"—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ivy wasn't decoration; it was archive," with rhythm modulating under pressure ("She pressed her palm and wept—not softly"). Minor syntactic repetition in "daringly methodical" phrasing prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bellows sighed as she walked—each step a note in a dirge" achieves triple duty (setting/emotion/motif). Figurative language remains coherent ("graffiti tags layered like geological strata") even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicling and bathroom graffiti as emotional cartography avoids redemption tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes via "raw solace" over catharsis, though premise echoes "healing through art" conventions slightly.</comment>
