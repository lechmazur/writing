<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices like tracing "comma-shaped beetle" and planting under surveillance, but Dr. Vex’s sudden alliance lacks sufficient micro-choice buildup—his hesitation at the lullaby feels under-earned for high-stakes defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with "the spark wasn’t hers alone anymore. It was a garden," crystallizing cost through children singing lullabies. Orientation anchors by word 30, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through dew-catch patterns reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: damp moss tiles muffle boots, wasp nests hide Vex, and gourd tendrils become sky-visible syntax. Final image’s "garden" recharges the setting’s meaning with undeniable cost—environment actively charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (linguistic resistance vs. cognitive taxation) tightens via gourd’s growth, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options; Vex’s cooperation resolves pressure too cleanly without visible cost escalation during planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gourd’s evolution from seed to "living transmitter," avoiding moralizing. Ending’s children singing lullabies offers resonant non-literal answer to "standing guard over spark," reweighting defiance as communal growth without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles ("glass panes rattled with converging chaos"), but "candidly cryptic" recurs as tic (3x), slightly marring rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulation stays consistent during high-stakes planting, avoiding stress-induced register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beats; "converging chaos" evolves from description to thematic motif without muddle. Minor paraphrase loop in "converging chaos of winged things... rebellions" prevents 9.5, but propulsion remains unbroken by figurative language.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Biopunk linguistics (gourds as language vessels) transforms dystopian tropes with fresh specificity. "Thoughts taxable" premise avoids derivativeness through horticultural resistance, and the comma-beetle glyph embodies risk-taking that heightens stakes cohesively.</comment>
