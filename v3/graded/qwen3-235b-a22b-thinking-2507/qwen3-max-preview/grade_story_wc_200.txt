<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("modest fearlessness" as kneeling beside dread) and embodied emotion ("throat tight with luminous ache") avoid therapy-speak; micro-choices like playing the flute reveal hierarchy of values through concrete action rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ghosts integrating while laughter carries downstream crystallizes options with felt cost ("luminous ache"), but the conceptual cost of grief-as-companionship lacks sufficient physical anchoring in the final image to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Misaligned harp constrains every choice (guiding her, dictating flute strategy) and charges closure as dissonance "softens, realigns"; the gorge’s geology literally transforms through action, making setting indispensable to the final image’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency (flute harmonizing), narrowing options as dissonance shifts to laughter, but the conceptual cost of "grief needing no fixing" remains slightly abstract despite "luminous ache"; visceral price needs sharper physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through concrete actions (flute playing, tooth metabolizing sorrow); "laughter is sorrow’s oldest sibling" resonates without moralizing, with the final giggle carrying earned thematic weight that reweights prior grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind snagging on fissures," "mercury" memory) and rhythmic control (fragmented beats during tension) teach compression early; lyrical density never obscures causality despite poetic intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cracked air like a dropped plate" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in "spectral confessions" (abstract term amid concrete action) prevents 9.5, but no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "soul collector" trope through specific mechanics (harp dissonance, crocodile tooth); "modest fearlessness" and gorge-as-instrument feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
