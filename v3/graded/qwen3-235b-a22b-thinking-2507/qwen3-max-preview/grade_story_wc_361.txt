<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in courier’s duty vs wonder conflict; micro-choices (fork selection, pendant sharing) reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("trembling not from cold"). Mentor’s absence lacks concrete friction in peak beats, slightly muddying motivation’s consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: pendant’s release crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("empty-handed, humming"), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure tightens via sensory density at ridgeway fork; no orientation debt. Lens inferred by paragraph 2 holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant constrain choices (fork decision, dilation scene) and charge final image (pendant dissolving into aurora). "Brittle frost that sang" exemplifies tactile, lived-in specificity; environment mirrors internal shift from calcified routine to fertile wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver casket vs share wonder) tightens meaningfully at ridgeway fork; courier’s agency in choosing Hollow Market narrows options with felt cost (relinquishing pendant). Pressure accumulates through sensory escalation under textural lens, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "germinating wonder" via pendant resonance reweights premise at closure. Final image ("child’s wonder lingered... seeding") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. "Routine became legend" avoids symmetry but borders on thematic echo in mid-paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("sky bled violet," "frost sang"); rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (three-heartbeat dilation scene). "Tarnished silver" eyes slightly clichéd, but voice remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("vibrating sympathetically against her sternum" does triple duty). Final line’s cadence ("humming a lullaby only the wind remembered") achieves propulsion without muddle. Minor register drift in "tarnished silver" but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier fantasy + philosophical wonder: "germinating awe in barren moments" transforms tropes through specific logic (pendant physics). Risk-taking with textural structure heightens stakes; avoids safety middle via concrete emotional cost in release.</comment>
