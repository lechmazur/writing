<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices ("lied to supervisor... secretly mapping") and embodied motivation (patch as "signal," not tribute). Final renunciation—"documented nothing. Reported less"—earns cost through prior causality, though physical stress during ritual lacks fuller embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost: "They weren’t coming back. But they weren’t gone." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via pattern escalation—0707 recurrence tightening into ritual—while cost proof ("documented nothing") lands cleanly on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Server racks as "mausoleums" and patch as micro-setting charge the final image ("truth pulses in her sleeve, stitched in scorched thread"). Sensory selection masterfully filters urgency through archivist’s lens, though ritual scene could deepen tactile immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally tighten as 0707 evolves from coincidence to coordinates to ritual trigger, driven entirely by protagonist agency. Cost—"documented nothing. Reported less"—unmistakably alters tactics, with silence itself becoming the dominant pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Files didn’t ‘go’ anywhere... unraveled into the substrate" reweights deletion as conceptual repricing. Final line—"they linger... humming back"—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("silence screamed louder than alerts") and rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for tension, lyrical cadence for reflection—show distinct voice. Compression during ritual ("She flooded the system...") maintains coherence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "She stopped searching... she knew now: they don’t go. They linger" deliver high density with propulsion. Figurative language ("resonance chamber") clarifies meaning without muddle, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "deleted files" trope via specific corporate archive lens—"de-referenced" as conceptual innovation. Risk-taking (numbers as ghost language) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional truth in "sensed absence" avoiding generic digital afterlife clichés.</comment>
