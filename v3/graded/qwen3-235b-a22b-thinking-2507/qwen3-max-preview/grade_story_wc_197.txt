<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation ("tyranny of indifference") is visceral and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses—her resourcefulness never falters under pressure, missing the Q1 9+ requirement for simultaneous conflicting drives during pivotal choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (broadcasting truth amid sirens), with conceptual cost in the regime’s crumbling narrative control, but the enforcers’ arrival feels coincidental rather than causally earned by her actions, weakening escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon’s reflections directly constrain Elira’s choices (dusk timing, ripple patterns), charging the final image—footprints in wet sand—and satisfying Q3’s 9+ gate by making the environment indispensable to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("tyranny of indifference") are thematically rich but remain abstract; pressure tightens via moon alignment, yet no tangible trade-off or visible price (e.g., injury, lost tool) escalates cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final line "Coded freedom never announces itself. It reappears" reweights the entire premise non-literally, avoiding moralizing while crystallizing theme through the Ace of Keys—perfectly executing Q5’s 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("puddle reflections at dusk"), but filter verbs ("remembered," "tracing") dilute immediacy during high-stakes rewiring, preventing full rhythmic control under pressure required for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor metaphor clash ("water cool as forgotten truth") muddles sensory clarity in a peak beat; otherwise, prose is taut and propulsion-driven, but this flaw disallows 9.0+ per Q7’s artifact policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Puddle maps" transform rebellion tropes with fresh specificity, yet "underestimated rebel" lacks bold risk—Elira’s flawless execution avoids meaningful struggle, missing the Q8 9+ distinction for heightened stakes via vulnerability.</comment>
