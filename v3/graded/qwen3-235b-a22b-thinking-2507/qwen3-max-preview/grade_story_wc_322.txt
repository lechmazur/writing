<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "rational enchantment" belief versus emotional weaving; micro-choices like ignoring mirror warnings reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Final renunciation of the thread earns cost through prior causality, though mirror selves lack tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "older, quieter, eyes gleaming with something between sorrow and satisfaction" crystallizes the conceptual price of connection. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as texture-weaving deepens the stake without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gallery setting charges closure—walls rippling like muscle and marble cracking into lace constrain choices by becoming active participants in the weaving. The sinew thread (micro-setting) charges the final image as it "stitches the ruptured space," satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when mirrors reflect alternate selves, forcing her to prioritize discovery over safety. Agency-driven escalation peaks with the ceiling split, but resistance from the gallery feels slightly abstract—cost is emotional (sorrow/satisfaction) yet lacks tangible tradeoffs like lost memories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ending’s "texture of connection" reweights prior material non-literally: the bruised purple sky from her first kiss becomes the gallery’s revelation, answering "what holds us together" through sensory accumulation without moralizing. Theme emerges purely from concrete actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"walls breathing in sync with her pulse," "time flowed as memories alter"—with rhythmic control under pressure. Elisions (e.g., "stepping over thresholds that didn’t exist") are taught early and paid off in the rupture’s lyric payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sinew thread" evolves from "pulsed faintly" to "blazing," avoiding overwriting. Minor deduction for "rational enchantment" bordering on thematic label in one beat, but immediate embodiment ("geometric precision") prevents drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms optical illusion tropes through specific, grounded choices: "Möbius strips for love that never began" synthesizes math and emotion. Risk-taking (abstract texture as tangible thread) heightens stakes, though gallery mechanics echo Escher without fresh inflection.</comment>
