<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; keeper’s serene acceptance ("letting histories breathe") avoids genuine struggle despite "trembling palms." Motivation to witness is clear but under-tested—hesitation at return lacks meaningful stakes escalation. No earned change beyond passive softening, failing 9+ causality gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: keeper’s altered state ("softened, like wax") with visible cost (dissolution of grief/hope) under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("chronicle keeper," "catacombs," timeless setting). Minor deduction as "crumbling peace" conclusion feels slightly pat without deeper tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice and charges closure: obsidian refuge’s reflective surface enables the journey, while origami swan’s creases dictate navigation ("Turn left at the sigh"). Micro-setting mastery in "quill carved from owl bone" releasing weight, fulfilling 9+ gate by charging final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing without judgment) tightens via keeper’s journey, with cost legible in "grief had no place here." But escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; stakes remain abstract as the setting—not keeper’s choices—forces the climax. Missing one visible tactical tradeoff under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "wept, not for loss, but for beauty" reweights acceptance as love without moralizing. Final line ("gripping reality loosely... last note of a lullaby") offers resonant non-literal answer to transience, avoiding thematic echo. Closure’s cost (erasure of binary emotions) is conceptually undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "moss clinging to stone arches like forgotten thoughts," with rhythm modulating to the journey’s intensity. Zero head-hopping; voice consistency from "crunching brittle scrolls" to "river murmured over smooth stones." Patterned elision (time collapse) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding: "reality here grips loosely" tells rather than shows. Near-duplicates ("frayed edges of memory" / "frayed nerves of the soul") cost 0.1. Otherwise pristine propulsion—"time unspooled—not as a thread, but as a spiral"—avoids figurative muddle. Final line’s cadence crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archetypes via concrete stakes: "regenerative silence" as active force, not trope. Emotional truth in "wept for beauty" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric structure, quiet closure) heightens coherence—obsidian refuge’s reflection reweights knowledge itself without gimmickry.</comment>
