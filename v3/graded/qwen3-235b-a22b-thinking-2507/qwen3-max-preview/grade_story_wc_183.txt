<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("stitched from divergent souls") and embodied emotion ("fingers trembling" at the name) power micro-choices under pressure. Motivation to recapture abandoned selves intensifies credibly through the garden climax. Slight abstraction in "echoes of selves" dilutes concrete stakes by 0.1.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "I am both... and all" crystallizes stance with cost in the Lirien hesitation. Accumulative lens (textural density building to cadence shift) holds without contradiction. Fog thinning as recognition provides undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned ship setting actively constrains choices (tarped carousel, corroded valve) and charges the final image (dulled swatch card, thinning fog). Micro-setting of the emerald card guides tactics through three beats. Sensory details ("copper and cinnamon air") reflect urgency without checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapturing abandoned selves) tightens through deepening: the garden forces a trade-off between wholeness and fracture. Pressure grows via memory unraveling and swatch card pulses. Cost in hesitation before taking Lirien is felt but lacks sharper physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme of "trapped freedom" resolves non-literally through the final line's reconfiguration ("still freedom—if you chose the bars"). No thematic echo; resonance emerges from concrete particulars (thickened vines, split floor). Ambiguity about Lirien's integration deepens complexity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("memories altered with every breath") and rhythmic control ("carousel horses frozen mid-gallop") persist under pressure. Voice modulates perfectly from reflective to urgent. Minor paraphrase loop ("no mere sample; it was...") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("birthday cake melting into her palms, a lullaby sung in two voices") propels momentum. "Melting into" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat but avoids muddle. Final line’s cadence shift ("lighter yet heavier") delivers closure without slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms carnival trope through name-garden mechanics; "trapped freedom" risks feel earned via concrete stakes. Emotional specificity ("stitched from divergent souls") avoids generic templates. Near-echo of Borges' gardens mitigated by visceral execution (-0.1).</comment>
