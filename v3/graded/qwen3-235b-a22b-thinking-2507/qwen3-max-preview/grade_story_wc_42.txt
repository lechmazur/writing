<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "luminous ache" and orchard memory, but "escape velocity" mentor quote edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost within 3 lines during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands perfectly: time braiding with "tears crystallizing" as visceral cost, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation to the mosaic Earth reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lunar observatory functions as micro-setting—low gravity crystallizing tears charges the final image, while dust-raining ceilings and boiling clouds constrain Elira’s stillness under pressure, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through "shaking foundations" to cosmic dissonance, but the dominant "restructure time" goal lacks tangible trade-offs; cost feels conceptual rather than tactical until the braiding climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from camera mechanics ("ephemeral harnessed not caged"), with the falling leaf’s echo as CR that reweights time’s grammar without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("obsidian void," "storm-tossed milk"), but "escape velocity" phrasing momentarily drifts into academic register during high stress, slightly muddying Elira’s voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crisp whisper of autumn" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-miss: "pure, luminous ache" risks purple prose but is redeemed by later visceral crystallization in low gravity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time-manipulation tropes via camera repairer lens—shutter mechanics applied to cosmic scales feels inevitable. Risk-taking (sound restructuring time) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
