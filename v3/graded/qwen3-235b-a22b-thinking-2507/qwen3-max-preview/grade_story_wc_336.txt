<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation ("could not bear a world without that shimmer") feels authentic and embodied, but lacks contradictory impulses; her stewardship is steadfast without meaningful internal conflict or change. Micro-choices (weaving memories) reveal character, yet the absence of struggle flattens escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed’s glow answering dawn crystallizes belonging with undeniable conceptual cost (worlds sighing in relief). Orientation anchors by 50 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation (weaving sequence) to resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Waterfall and parapet create vivid atmosphere but remain ornamental; they supply no tactical constraints or pressure on choices. The seed’s physicality charges the final image, yet environment fails to shape tactics as required for Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder’s color) are clear and urgent, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the weaving ritual deepens texture without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. Cost is conceptual (fading wonder) yet feels distant from Elira’s immediate actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the seed’s tangible "color of wonder," avoiding moralizing. Final image (glow answering dawn) offers resonant non-literal answer to loss, but thematic complexity is thin—no counter-readings or moral ambiguity deepen the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moss that sighed with ancient memory") and rhythmic control under pressure shine; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure. Minor flaw: diction stays uniformly poetic during high-stakes weaving, missing stress-induced compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise, with masterful rhythm and density; "obsidian-black, veined with threads of iridescent blue" risks mixed metaphor but avoids clarity loss. Scaffold in "She was insatiably creative..." slightly dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological stewardship and metaphysical wonder avoids cliché; "color of wonder" as tangible concept feels inevitable. Risks lyrical structure successfully, yet the "wise orchard pruner" archetype lacks transformative specificity to reach 9.0.</comment>
