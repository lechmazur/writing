<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in claustrophobia vs mission-driven resolve; "chanting coordinates like prayers" embodies micro-choice under pressure. Final transformation earned through embodied struggle in the narrow passage, with cost legible in widened passage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: compass pointing to chest crystallizes spatial mutiny's truth with undeniable conceptual cost ("passage behind her had widened"). Accumulative lens held throughout, pressure tightening via organ's pull toward embodied revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stone ribs constraining breath and compass point growing warm charge the final image. Dome's moving stars and widening passage directly reconfigure spatial stakes, with body (shoulders scraped) and tool (compass) constraining choices then transforming closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early via "world unraveling at spatial seams"; escalation driven by Elara's agency entering the narrow passage, with cost visible in physical/emotional transformation. Organ's pull deepens knowledge, narrowing options to surrender or flight before the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny was not chaos—it was liberation" emerges as earned wisdom through concrete struggle, avoiding moralizing. Final image of humming steps reweights the premise with conceptual cost (claustrophobia dissolved), offering resonant non-literal answer to spatial rebellion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spatial observations ("ribs of stone pressing inward"); rhythmic control shifts from staccato tension to flowing liberation. No head-hopping, with voice modulating under pressure via compressed syntax during descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid geometry" and "cartographer of possibility" demonstrate high-density imagery without muddle. Final line’s cadence ("steps light, path unwritten") charges closure with crystalline propulsion, varying rhythm to match emotional shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny reimagined as liberation synthesizes claustrophobia and cartography into inevitable emotional truth. Bold structural risk in Accumulative lens pays off via organ’s motif, with "wistful rebellion" tone avoiding generic novelty through embodied specificity.</comment>
