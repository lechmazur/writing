<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "balance over mercy" guilt versus ritual action; embodied remorse through physicalizing names as stitches, but "luminous regret" risks label-only feeling despite contextual anchoring in kneeling posture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: coin shattering into gilded dust carrying names reconfigures redemption with undeniable cost ("weights lifted—not gone, but transformed"); Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to resonant final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Foundry’s "cold iron floors" and "warped anvil" constrain choice (crucible placement); the golden seam on anvil charges closure by proving "sacred breakage," satisfying micro-setting gate for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake ("weight of names") tightens through naming sequence where each name adds emotional gravity; cost crystallizes when coin shatters under "too heavy" remorse, narrowing options to acceptance of transformed weights.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of "golden seam on anvil" reweights kintsugi theme non-literally: breakage becomes sacred through active mending, avoiding moralizing while answering "how to redeem" via embodied action over abstract philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in alchemical lexicon ("mercury to sulfur," "kintsugi intentions"); rhythmic control peaks during coin-shattering sequence where short clauses ("The coin shattered. Not into shards...") mirror fragmentation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "factually mystical" repetition (paragraphs 3/5) and "dissolved regret" risking abstraction, but high density ("motes of gilded dust that spiraled upward, catching dim light like fireflies born of starlight") sustains propulsion to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy trope through specific emotional calculus: redemption as "hauling anchors" not erasing guilt; "luminous regret" redefines balance as "dance between fracture and gold" with bold structural commitment to Accumulative pressure.</comment>
