<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "patience is the grammar of absolution" versus planting seeds she "doesn’t know if they’ll grow." Final uncloaking earns tenuous absolution through causal buildup, though "tenuous absolution" phrasing slightly over-articulates emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: water drip crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost in shawl removal. Orientation anchors by word 20 ("birds fly south"), and Accumulative escalation tightens through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as active constraint—moss muffles footsteps forcing her pace, dry fountain enables seed planting. Final water drip from "hidden spring" charges closure by making the setting respond to her actions, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (feeling sacred again) tightens through her shift from passive offering to active gardening. Cost is visceral in "crust hardened like old promises" and shawl removal, though bakery reflection slightly over-clarifies the stake’s origin.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—"crumb of vanished bread" to "seed pressed into earth"—avoiding moralizing. Final star image ("she doesn’t need to") reweights sacredness without stating a moral, though "sacred isn’t in grand cathedrals" flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("heuristically gentle" pace, "rustle becomes whisper") creates distinct voice. Rhythm modulates under pressure—long sentences for observation, staccato for "She uncloaks"—but "tenuous absolution" slightly drifts from POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crust hardened like old promises" shows instead of tells. Final line’s cadence ("first star blinks awake. She doesn’t name it.") propels closure, though "tenuous absolution" phrasing risks register drift in one peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "post-apocalyptic" tropes via specific details (bakery bell "chimed like temple gong"). Risk-taking in quiet climax—no grand gesture, just planting seeds—heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
