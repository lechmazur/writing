<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (bare feet apologizing to earth, brambles recoiling to her presence), with final renunciation earned by pool revelations; minimal risk from "chose power over pulse" dialogue avoided via figure's authority and immediate starlight immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "climb back down not as queen" crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost ("sky weeps your neglect"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation from static-humming air to starlight tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Grotto's starlight actively constrains choices (guiding fireflies, scorching/sustaining touch) and charges final image (fireflies syncing to heartbeat); micro-setting of bare feet on shale embodies humility that reshapes the queen's descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation through sensory deepening: air thinning to bleeding stars to fireflies syncing breath creates relentless pressure; cost crystallizes when pool reveals her child's release, making "unbury what you buried" feel viscerally earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete images: "bleeding starlight = memory leaking" reweights the premise without moralizing; final fireflies-as-living-lace image offers resonant answer to "lacy menace" opening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is character-particular ("linen whispered like regret," "moss and shale" under soles); rhythmic control shifts from fragmented climb sentences to flowing revelation prose without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding: "pulse—not twinkle, but bleed" demonstrates syntactic precision; no loops or register drift even in high-pressure beats like the pool's memory revelations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "queen's journey" trope via specific mechanics (starlight as mercury wine, fireflies synced to breath); risk-taking in prioritizing lyric density over plot pays off through Charged Poise closure.</comment>
