<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman's embodied contradictions (control as illusion vs. ambient awareness) drive choices, but passenger's grief remains slightly archetypal despite the needle exchange. Micro-choice of offering the needle earns the closure's emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fog-parting threshold crystallizes options with felt cost ("spindrift serenity" as distilled essence from decades of motion). Backstory fragments deepen present stakes without breaking Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing constrains every choice—the ticking gutters as countdown clock, submerged stones felt through wheels. Final "spindrift serenity" image charges the setting's evolution from obstacle to threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as gutters fall silent, forcing the coachman's stillness and the passenger's resolve. Cost is conceptual (decades of motion crystallizing into clarity) but slightly abstract; "weight of silence" grounds it just enough for the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the needle's evolution from memory-tool to invitation reweights "distill complexity" without moralizing. Final image ("palimpsest promise hummed between them") offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("horses’ breaths syncopated like tide against stone") modulates with pressure. One near-drift ("percolated truth as others percolated coffee") slightly jars coachman’s lexicon but doesn’t fracture voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "spindrift serenity" borders on overwrought lyricism in the final beat. No loops or scaffold, though "syncopated like tide" risks mixed metaphor in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: yarn needle as philosopher’s blade transforms "palimpsest" from trope into active constraint. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens in short form) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "distill complexity" edges toward familiar phrasing.</comment>
