<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s choral training and "empathetically decisive" nature manifest in concrete micro-choices (weaving Guarani responses), but the elevator’s anthropomorphism lacks interior contradiction; its "relief" feels imposed rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the elevator’s open doors welcoming children reconfigures silos from tombs to sanctuaries, with cost legible in "dust puffing like exhaled relief" and the shift from "borrowed starlight" to "earned sunrise" under a coherent accumulative/textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brass dials and copper wires create vivid atmosphere, but the clock tower’s setting doesn’t constrain choices; the cuckoo weight’s "density as counterpoint" is thematic without tactical pressure, missing the 9+ gate’s requirement for environmental constraint on the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s language-layering method, with agency crystallizing in the suspended cuckoo weight’s harmonic cascade; escalation culminates in the elevator’s vocal progression (Ukrainian → Rumi → English) and visible cost in "shaking loose decades of silence."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Construct bridges from silos" emerges organically from concrete action, not abstraction; the final image of children climbing reweights "borrowed starlight" into "earned sunrise" as a resonant, non-literal answer to liberation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("metronome ticks," "seismic whispers") is consistently choral; rhythmic control modulates perfectly from hushed precision to vigorous tenderness during the harmonic cascade, with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "Bridges require weight" echoes the cuckoo weight’s earlier role without deepening meaning; otherwise, propulsion is relentless with high density ("dust puffing like exhaled relief" avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism through specific sonic mechanics; the elevator’s Ukrainian/Shona vocal progression feels earned, not whimsical. Highest risk (cuckoo weight as talisman) is grounded by "grounding runaway thought" logic without gimmickry.</comment>
