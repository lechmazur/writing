<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("skepticism warred with sensation") drive Elira’s closure choice to transcribe for "wanderers," sacrificing personal resolution. Embodied motivation ("calloused hands," "breath caught") avoids therapy-speak while showing cost through her rolled parchment’s "rests where grief lived."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whale-song sync deepens emotional density without causal turns, meeting "one meaningful deepening" standard. Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("leaving the tile... waiting faithfully"), but escalation lacks narrowing of options—transcribing feels inevitable from setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower’s open arches literally channel whale song that syncs with the tile, constraining Elira’s action ("tracing glyphs"). Final image ("moonlight silvered waves") charges the tile’s pulse, satisfying the 9+ gate where micro-setting (tile) shapes the ending’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("sculpt space for reflection") is clear, but whale-song sync deepens theme without altering tactics—Elira transcribes regardless. Cost (sacrificed personal closure) is felt but not viscerally tested; escalation lacks narrowing of options or trade-off beyond initial setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "magic wasn’t in the object, but in the entanglement" crystallizes via tile-whale-heartbeat sync. Final image ("trembling hand to remember how to listen") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "calloused from brittle scrolls" over cosmic wonders, rhythm modulating from lyrical ("salt winds carrying whale songs") to sparse ("She didn’t transcribe words"). Zero head-hopping; voice stays consistent under pressure with purposeful fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "pulsed faintly—not with light, but with rhythm" avoids cliché. Final line’s "trembling hand" echoes "calloused hands" with resonant specificity. Near-purple prose ("unheard symphony woven from solitude") works via motif integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope: tile as memory conduit (not spellbook) deepens through whale-human entanglement. Emotional specificity ("weight of longing, lift of wonder") avoids genericity, while risk-taking in quiet closure ("waiting faithfully") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
