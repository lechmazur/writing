<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elira’s "fiercely gentle" motivation drives every micro-choice (barefoot on bone, wrist-touch anchor), with Kael’s "funeral shrouds and spite" establishing vital status dynamics. Only deduction: slightly over-articulated dialogue in climax undermines peak-beat emotional realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (Kael’s grip loosening as "seedling"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through root/card patterns. Minor deduction: "verdant light" phrasing slightly obscures physical causality in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as active micro-setting: roots physically restrain Kael, bone-earth contact drives Elira’s vows. Final "bone-laced boughs" image charges closure by constraining the reconciliation—environment essential to tactical outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Single dominant stake ("barter vs carve" destinies) tightens via Kael’s lunge triggering root restraint, with visible cost in his softened stance. Escalation driven entirely by protagonist’s agency (Elira’s touch, words), no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("moss in eye sockets"), avoiding moralizing. Final image—roots weaving destinies—offers resonant answer to "patching soul holes" without stating moral, reweighting prior material via "light that’s left" cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused from digging/delicate from healing"), voice modulates perfectly under pressure. Deduction: slight register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing during climax weakens Elira’s lexicon consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful rhythm and density ("gnarled roots threading through femurs"), but "verdant light" abstraction and minor "trammel" repetition in high-pressure beat create slight figurative muddle. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via "catacomb orchard" as living collaborator; emotional truth in morally complex Kael (softened but not redeemed). Fresh inflection: "patching soul holes with dirt meaning" synthesizes premise with visceral stakes.</comment>
