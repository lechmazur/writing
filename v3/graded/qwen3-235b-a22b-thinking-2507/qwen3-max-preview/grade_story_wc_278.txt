<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (trembling ink, blood-mixed tattoo), but "seventeen" backstory lacks embodied specificity; micro-choices under pressure strong yet final forgiveness arc slightly over-tidied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure (no clear anchors by 120 words) caps score, but closure lands powerfully: Earned Stasis via firmware's weeping and the father's "thank you" with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cap enforced by Q2 orientation penalty; lab setting constrains choices (cradle wax sealing, glyph transfer) yet initial white-room vagueness undermines spatial coherence despite vivid sensory details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (hushing guilt) tightens through glyph application; cost crystallizes when firmware "weeps" and screams "unravel into yawns"—profound conceptual reweighting under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "silence wasn't peace—it was suffocation" recharged by final "quiet release" glow; no moralizing, only resonant CR via Cradle Major constellation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice mastery—lyric compression taught early ("laboratory of lost sounds") pays off at closure; meteor hush motif modulates rhythm under stress without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor overwriting in "static dissolved into sighs" slightly muddles causality but doesn't obscure closure image’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: firmware as "regrets given voice" transforms grief tropes; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "constellation tattooist" verges on familiar.</comment>
