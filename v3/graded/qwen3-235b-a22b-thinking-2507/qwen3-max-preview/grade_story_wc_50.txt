<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (e.g., peripheral gaze avoiding direct stare) and embodied emotion (collecting shards by "emotional temperature"). Final endurance—leaving timer as "fulcrum"—earns closure with felt cost of departure. Lacks in-scene contradictory impulses beyond methodological focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: cavern holds preserved wonder with conceptual cost (locksmith's departure, world's future need). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (timer shudders, quartz pulses). Cost legible but not pinpointed to one on-page image, missing 9+ by hairline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marble cavern constrains choices (light angles, peripheral focus) and charges closure ("wonder fermented in perfect, angular silence"). Micro-setting (timer mechanism) alters tactics—shards embedded in resin slabs by frequency. Environment reweights stakes via crystallized resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder against time's erosion) deepens through density (11:03 glyph, 3:17 pulses). Agency via methodical work forecloses path of "fixing time," but cost remains abstract; departure lacks visceral dramatization despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: resin slabs storing "grief at the bottom, awe near the top." Final image reweights premise—wonder as "nutrient" preserved in stone—without moralizing. Two elevating features: constraint shapes tactics, final image recharges prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glimmers between shadows where meaning pooled like mercury") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from melancholy ("frost clung like regret") to reverence ("marble throat of the earth"). Zero head-hopping; elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in high-pressure beats ("not wrenches or picks, but mirrors..." then "not spectral ghosts—but echoes?"). Filter verbs ("fingertips brushing," "gaze never settled") dull immediacy slightly during quartz-shard collection. Closure remains sharp despite hairline loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of physics and poetry ("echoes as physics wearing poetry’s coat") feels inevitable. Risk-taking with accumulative lens heightens stakes via cinnamon-tasting glyphs and emotional-resonance storage. Fresh inflection in final image charging prior particulars.</comment>
