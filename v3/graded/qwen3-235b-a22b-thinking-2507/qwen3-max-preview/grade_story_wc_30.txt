<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cataloged truths or merely beautiful lies") and embodied moon-phase fluctuations drive micro-choices; final renunciation of certainty earns cost through prior causality ("edges blur... from wisdom").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options ("let it breathe, let it change") with felt cost ("certainty soften—not from weakness, but from wisdom"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic deepening to the final step into silver hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium’s bioluminescent tide constrains action (creel baptism in liquid moonlight) and charges closure ("wintersun serenity" hues reframing preservation); lunar quartz lenses filter perception to constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder amid flux) tightens through creel’s glyph transformation, but escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options; cost ("softened certainty") is conceptual but not viscerally felt despite poetic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("wonder doesn’t die—it molts") reweights "migrating identities" theme without moralizing; contradictions ("joy and grief share the same forge") earn wisdom through concrete smelting ritual, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (lunar quartz lenses revealing "glint of magic in the mundane") creates distinct bias; rhythmic control under pressure ("bamboo ribs creaking like old bones") avoids cadence loops while teaching pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No closure-dulling artifacts; high density ("scales glittered like half-remembered dreams") but minor synonym churn in "tide lines on sand" / "traces like tide lines" slightly muddles momentum in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk (titan-gear) and mythic ecology; "smelting contradictions" transforms preservation trope through specific lunar mechanics, with risk-taking (Accumulative/Textural closure) heightening coherence.</comment>
