<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction masterfully embodied: bare feet vs. sharp mask, weaving truth through silence. Micro-choice of not turning to visitor reveals hierarchy of values—truth over comfort. Only slight abstraction in "weaves truth" phrasing holds it from 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: rocking chair’s stillness crystallizes "hollow where motion used to live." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each ash-scattering deepens the stake without causal turns. Orientation clear by word 15 ("vanishing point gallery").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Gallery breathes as active constraint: "no windows" defines false safety, rocking chair’s motion/stillness directly charges closure. Micro-setting (porcelain mask, ash vial) alters every choice. Final "charcoal and ash" tones with candle flame reconfigure the premise irreplaceably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stake tightening when visitor recognizes her emotion: scatterer’s agency ("It’s how you still feel") forces crystallization. Cost is visceral—chair’s stillness, mask seams, woman’s relieved departure. Single deepening under textural lens suffices, reweighting "safety" with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: teacup shards = broken safety, unsent letters = fragile emotions. Final line "gloriously, somberly real" resonates without moralizing. Avoids all anti-patterns—no thematic echo, complexity embraced via the mask’s duality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "voice curled around corners like smoke," ash "clinging to ridges of cheekbones." Syntax modulates with pressure—lyrical during ritual, terse with visitor. Zero head-hopping; compression taught immediately and paid off in closure’s "motionless but not empty."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "jagged contours catching light like frozen screams" multiplies meaning without muddle. One borderline abstract phrase ("tactile, sacred") quickly redeemed by concrete action. Closure lines ("mirage fades... truth imperfectly held") propel with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via hyper-specifics: ash from unsent letters, porcelain from teacups. "Mirage of safety" reframed through rocking chair’s motion. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—gallery’s breathing walls charge closure without gimmickry. Derivative guardrail passed.</comment>
