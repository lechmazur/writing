<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied detail ("trembling hands" vs steady voice), with curiosity driving concrete micro-choices under pressure. Slight repetition of "diligently curious" edges toward tell-y phrasing but doesn't undermine the earned vulnerability during the captain confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Arlen's "whispered back" crystallizes the cost of shifting from observer to conductor. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (murmurations → hopscotch → luminance tuning), with the phrasebook's "last dog-ear" moment charging the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stranded luminance functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (redirecting light flow via chalk grid), charging the final image where "wings catching light Arlen taught the ship to share." Balloon skin's shimmer isn't backdrop—it's the very medium of discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (controlling luminance for discovery) tightens through Arlen's agency: his three-night research narrows options to a decisive presentation. Visible cost in "trembling hands" during the captain confrontation alters tactics, making the crew's chalk-grid adoption feel earned rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hopscotch cipher's evolution: "whispered back" answers the central question without moralizing. The final image reweights "blank spaces" into active dialogue, avoiding sentimentality by rooting insight in concrete action (murmurations dancing "with purpose").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chalk dust gathered like miniature dunes") reflects Arlen's mapmaker bias. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure: short, clipped sentences during discovery ("Excitement prickled his scalp") contrast with lyrical closure, all while maintaining single-POV consistency without filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "brass fittings groaned like old bones" does triple duty (setting/tone/character bias) without scaffold. Minor synonym churn on "diligently curious" (appearing twice) slightly dulls momentum in one beat but doesn't obscure closure's crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: hopscotch as luminance map feels inevitable in hindsight, not clever twist. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—the "sociable isolation" concept deepens through grease-stained mechanics sharing discovery space, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
