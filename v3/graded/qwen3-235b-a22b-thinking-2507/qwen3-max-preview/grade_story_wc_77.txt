<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fear is collaborator" paradox, but whispering advisor lacks agency-driven turns; micro-choices like chest-plunging earn closure with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "You're the hunted thought" reweights fear's nature with visible cost in dissolving replica; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to funhouse's final exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Funhouse setting constrains every choice—cracked mirrors force dread-confrontation, mannequins pressure dialogue recitation; "lingering luminance" charges the final image as bile-twilight glow on walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: reading paradoxical notes triggers mirror shatter, memory extraction forces Fear's dissolution; cost legible in "knot of dread" pulled from ribs as physicalized consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not moralizing: "fear's weakness is being seen" crystallizes in replica's horror; final image reweights "collaborator" concept without stating moral, embracing complexity through luminous aftermath.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "molars ache" vibrations and "toxic film negatives" memory; minor filter-verb stacks ("I saw myself mid-scream") slightly distance peak beats without breaking rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "forged from melted carousel horses" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Near-miss mixed metaphor ("exhaled mildew and ghost of cotton candy") avoids clarity harm but prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms fear-confrontation trope via "unbosom" physicality and funhouse-as-memory-prison; risk-taking heightens stakes through surreal mechanics (reverse-lullaby, photographically cursed reflections) without gimmickry.</comment>
