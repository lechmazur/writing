<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied action (pressing palm to stone, holding whisk) avoids epiphanies; micro-choices like "demure audacity" humming show contradictory impulses. Final "I see you" whisper earns endurance with felt cost—vanishing footprints yet fireflies honoring her labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through rain-washed chalk marks to firefly alignment, crystallizing into Earned Stasis closure. Cost is legible in "damp footprints, already fading" and "whispered, 'I see you'"—renunciation with conceptual weight as her song stitches into the world's tapestry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain functions as micro-setting: rain-washed chalk marks directly constrain her kneeling gratitude, while moon paths guide movement. The bamboo whisk charges the final image—worn tines catching moonlight reweight its role as a tool "that stirred stillness into vitality."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stake ("appreciate hidden effort") tightens via widow’s memory and firefly response. Agency manifests in "demure audacity" choices—whistling her name, weaving shanty with fireflies—narrowing options to witness rather than escape. Cost is felt in vanishing footprints yet fireflies tracing moon paths in her honor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: mending nets, whispering to stones, whisk held aloft. Final image—"fireflies still blinked... honoring the hidden patterns"—resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, reweighting "demure audacity" as the quiet labor holding the world together.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bamboo tea whisk balanced like a divining rod," "moon paths" as silver sheen) reflects her net-mender’s eye for patterns. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during firefly pulse ("blinking gold against indigo, then another, then a dozen") avoid lyric overindulgence while teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "scintillatingly somber" (3x) serves motif without muddle. Peak-beat propulsion: "She whistled again, this time a fisherman’s shanty..." uses varied syntax to accelerate action. Final image’s "soft, somber, scintillating" note avoids cliché through precise auditory texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "wise hermit" trope via net-mender’s tactile philosophy—hidden patterns in knots, not stars. Fresh inflection: fireflies pulse "earnestly" to her shanty, reconfiguring "demure audacity" as communal. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("chipped clay cup," "tallies, forgotten prayers") anchors universals.</comment>
