<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "translation of silence" versus active resistance; micro-choices like channeling atomic resonance into brass reveal layered values under flood crisis. No unmotivated actions—botanist memory directly fuels genesis whisper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density escalates through vapor-hiss and shadow-waver until the hum-falter climax. Earned Stasis closure lands with visceral cost—her skin shifting from cobalt (grief) to gold (action) to shimmering futures reconfigures the library's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The brass sundial constrains every major choice—from calibration to flood intervention—and charges the final image as a "loom." Vapor-sea geography directly pressures tactics during the cloud-tide surge, transforming setting from mausoleum to genesis engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly under Veyra's agency: the hum's falter forces her resonance intervention, narrowing options to "forcing harmony where stone circle failed." Cost is undeniable—the shift from "weight of extinction" to "lightness of coexistence" crystallizes in her whispered coordinates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the sundial's shadow shifting from extinction to genesis reweights "coexistence" without moralizing. Final "loom" metaphor answers the central question by transforming preservation into active creation, avoiding false balance through her scar-tissue burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is laser-focused: scientific precision ("atomically reflective," "sub-cloud quakes") merges with poetic compression ("brittle awakenings"). Rhythm accelerates during flood crisis ("shadow wavered... coordinates blurred") while maintaining consistent voice under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vapor that hissed against brass and turned memory to mist" achieves triple duty. Final line recharges the opening's "no books—only echoes" with "turned its next page," avoiding closure muddle through crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes via "echoes not books" and vapor-rooting lifeforms. Emotional specificity in "scar tissue on soul" avoids trauma clichés, while the woodpecker coordinates' shift from grave to genesis feels inevitable yet fresh—bold synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
