<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's deafness drives embodied choices (palms on floor, vibration focus), but secondary characters remain archetypal ("hollow-eyed teens"). Contradictory impulses shine in her needle experiment—fear of void versus need to provoke—though student reactions lack individualized depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "luminous" silence after backward song reconfigures the "filament of hush" with visible cost (veteran's tears, girl's startled pulse). Causal escalation holds tight—needle discovery to rigged turntable narrows options cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drum cavern actively constrains choices: resin-smelling walls hold hanging chimes that "shuddered in sympathetic resonance," while the needle-as-scalpel charges the final image. Micro-setting (drumskin vibrations) dictates every action, passing the 9+ gate via closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: Elara's "audibly muted void" versus the filament of hush. One tightening—backward song's rupture—forecloses numbness with visceral cost (raw student reactions). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, reweighting silence from fragile thread to "braided with tension."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through inversion: "silence learned to scream" reweights healing without moralizing. Final image of needle-as-relic offers resonant answer—"carry the void as potential"—while avoiding binaries. No thematic echo; cost is felt in the "luminous" silence's earned transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "dust motes danced when struck by unseen pulses" filters world through vibration. Rhythmic control peaks during backward song ("skipped, stuttered, shrieked") with no head-hopping. Voice modulates stress via tactile compression ("palms flat on cavern floor").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line charges momentum ("harmonies dissolving like sugar in cold tea"). Figurative language serves character (needle as "scalpel"), not decoration. Sentence rhythm mirrors tension—staccato beats during phonograph crisis, lyrical flow in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "deaf musician" trope via backward-song mechanic: inversion exposes emotional seams through glitch, not melody. Fresh synthesis—silence as active confrontation—feels inevitable. Risks unconventional structure yet heightens stakes via tactile precision ("each skip became a gasp").</comment>
