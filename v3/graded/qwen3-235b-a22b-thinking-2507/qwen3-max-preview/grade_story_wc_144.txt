<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (fractures felt in "tremor of a gear’s hesitation"), and Elara’s contradictory impulses—urgency vs. "magnetic calm"—drive micro-choices under pressure. Botanist remains underdeveloped as pure pressure source, limiting relationship depth despite strong embodied emotion in the repair ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: drone’s flight crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (research lost if failed), anchored by the tide-turning deadline. Orientation is clear by line 3 ("mist-coated rail depot"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density tightens toward the orchids’ unfurling—a reconfiguration where cost is legible in "decade of hybrid research would dissolve."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The copper basin functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (refracting light to realign sensors) and charges the final image ("sensors drinking in fractured light"). Dew-slick rails and "salt-tinged sky" evolve with events, but "lunar resin" slightly strains plausibility without deeper occupational grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are visceral and early-signaled ("tide turned—literally"), with the anchor’s groan escalating pressure into a live clock that narrows options. Elara’s agency drives resolution through methodical repair, avoiding coincidence; cost is felt in the botanist’s silent vigil and the orchids’ dependency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mending trajectories" without moralizing; the drone’s flight reweights repair as sacred act via orchids unfurling—a non-literal answer to "fractures into flight paths." Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in sensory action ("exhaled warm air across its core").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("listened to the world’s whispers through fingertips") with rhythmic control under pressure: long, flowing sentences mirror Elara’s calm, while fragments like "She didn’t rush" heighten tension. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly to stress without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("dissolve like salt in seawater" economically conveys stakes), but "magnetic calm" edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold; final line’s cadence ("listened—to the rails, the tide...") resolves with textural precision. Minor overwriting in "memory trapped in dented metal" slightly muddles propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness as repair methodology avoids tropes through specific details (glycerin droplets, silk-moth resin). Emotional truth in quiet dedication elevates beyond surface novelty, though "lunar resin" risks quirky ornamentation without deeper integration into the world logic.</comment>
