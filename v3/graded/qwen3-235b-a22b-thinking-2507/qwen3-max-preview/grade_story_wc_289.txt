<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("soul frayed" vs. "chase the thread") drives organic choices; embodied emotion in ink-stained fingers dissolving. Lacks secondary pressure due to solo character, but micro-choices under pressure (writing names vs. love letters) earn transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "rejoin" crystallizes options as Aris dissolves into light. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from petrichor to "prismatic tapestry"; cost legible in "memories flowed into water." Minor deduction: no visible secondary cost beyond self.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lily pond constrains tactics (barefoot shallows) and charges closure (origami birds on water). Recurring object (twig spiral) evolves from "cipher" to "living compass," reweighting meaning. Sensory details filtered through Aris's bias (e.g., "pads gleaming like green moons").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging vs. isolation) signaled early ("soul frayed"), tightened through agency (writing names). Cost unmistakable in dissolution: "form unraveling like thread." Escalation driven by protagonist's choices under Accumulative lens; "rejoin" reconfigures options with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: names folded into birds become "the invisible thread." Final image ("woven into prismatic tapestry") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in "braids solitude into belonging" resists tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "rainwater dripped... into shallow basin" reflects Aris's precision. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Not love letters. Not confessions. But names.") avoids head-hopping. Voice modulates from lyrical ("petrichor and possibility") to sparse during transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("coiled like a question mark made of nature" does triple duty). Sentence rhythm varies from flowing ("water lilies bowed") to staccato ("Not love letters."). Final line recharges motif without figurative muddle. One ornamental phrase ("gleaming like green moons") costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific detail: "thrush’s nest twig spiral" as "living compass" avoids abstraction. Emotional truth in "keeper of secrets" becoming the secret. Risk-taking (dissolution into temple pulse) heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
