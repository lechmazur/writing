<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("purpose, not grief") and embodied humility ("let dust cling to skin") earned through dust observation micro-choices; no therapy-speak despite high-stakes realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when dust forms logarithmic spiral—reconfiguring her stance with visible cost ("kindled humility") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchored by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse micro-setting constrains every choice (salvaged interferometer, humidity effects); dust-as-tool charges final image where light turns slide into "living aurora" reweighting decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (stripping "needless drama") tightens through dust observations until spiral revelation; cost ("kindled humility") unmistakable when she weeps not from sorrow but cosmic humility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust sedimentation patterns rather than statement; final line ("I found them here, in the dust") reweights neutron stars as non-literal answer to "decay as iterative refinement" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("measuring gravitational waves" lens coloring dew observations); rhythmic control shifts from clinical ("fractal spirals") to lyrical ("creak like a ship hull") under pressure without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "interference fringes—not randomly, but rhythmically" exemplifies high-density propulsion; no figurative muddle in climax where spiral mirrors "accretion disk models".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neutron physics and dust ecology feels inevitable; risk-taking (science-meets-poetry) heightens stakes without gimmickry as "poetry was just physics with fewer equations".</comment>
