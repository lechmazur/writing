<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when solitude shifts from virtue to surrender; embodied choices like tracing wind patterns reveal values. Final endurance earns cost through visible cache retrieval and lateral movement plan. Lacks minor flaw manifestation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "He didn’t hurry" crystallizes stance with cost in "solitude felt like surrender." Causal lens holds through pigeon path tracing. Orientation anchored at line 3 ("quiet courtyard at dusk"). No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Courtyard micro-setting pressures choices (cache retrieval, tube discovery), but rail yard shift dilutes its payoff. Message tube as recurring object charges closure ("covenant"), though "warm, almost alive" edges toward over-symbolism. Sensory specificity anchors tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth preservation) tightens through Elias’s agency when rejecting official channels. Cost legible in "solitude felt like surrender" and tactical shift to lateral movement. Pressure coheres via pigeon path tracing, though quarantine threat lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: integrity shifts from "nurtured in solitude" to "weaponized" movement. Final covenant image reweights truth without moralizing. Loses 0.1 as "restore balance" slightly states thesis; cost remains conceptual rather than physical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: meteorological precision ("barometric drift," "wind vectors") filters all observation. Rhythmic control under pressure via measured steps syncing with city pulse. No head-hopping; elision taught early ("rustling leaves," "wind bell").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("unscrewed," "brushing moss"). "Static before quarantine" metaphor integrates flawlessly. Minor overwriting in "warm, almost alive" tube description risks slight muddle but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bureaucratic horror refracted through meteorological record-keeping. "Static before quarantine" transforms tropes. Emotional specificity in integrity’s evolution avoids genericity. No derivative echoes; commitment to premise heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
