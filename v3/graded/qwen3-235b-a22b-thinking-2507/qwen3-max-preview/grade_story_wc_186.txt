<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (seeking meaning vs fragility of vision) with embodied emotion ("thistle-blown hope"), but minor thematic abstraction in "stubborn weed-rooted optimism" slightly dilutes character-particularity at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "she had been summoned" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("fragile" vision), under Accumulative lens. Minor deduction as cost remains abstract (no physical toll), though "sand under tide" metaphor legibly charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Glass pavilion functions as active micro-setting: its shivering constrains prism alignment, while refracted light charges the final image ("thistles bowed in reverence"). "Powdered silica" under boots exemplifies tactile specificity that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when adjusting for Cassiopeia ("one tremor... collapse like sand"), but escalation lacks visceral pressure—conceptual cost (ephemeral understanding) feels less urgent than the fragility described, slightly softening the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through prism mechanics ("hidden stitches" becoming "luminous weave"), with final image reweighting "broken things" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo entirely; "reverence" for thistles delivers non-literal answer to meaning-seeking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glass sang with resonant moan," "wind scrubbed clean") modulates rhythm under pressure—longer sentences during alignment, staccato flashes during visions. Zero POV slippage; lamb's wool detail exemplifies character-particular diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "silver thread piercing the prism’s heart" compresses action/image, but "stubborn weed-rooted optimism" slightly overwrites, creating a density hiccup in high-pressure beat. Otherwise, zero loops with crystalline final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes through "shard of hush" concept—retro-cognition as active seeking (not passive memory) feels fresh. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though "convergences" resolution slightly neuters moral complexity.</comment>
