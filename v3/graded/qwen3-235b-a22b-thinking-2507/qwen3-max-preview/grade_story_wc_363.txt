<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (humming lullaby to preserve weave), contradictory impulses (longing vs. sacrifice) earned through amber bead's warmth during puzzle assembly. Micro-choice to dismantle loom for threshold-weaving crystallizes renunciation without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: "raveling silence" deepens from atmospheric trait to active pressure as bamboo grove stills during weaving. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—her empty chair and the sighing silence confirm irrevocable cost of message delivery, with solstice timing tightening temporal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting: plum pits supply dye resources while bamboo leaves' reverence during weaving constrain her tactics. Final image of bead hovering with "scent of plum blossoms" charges closure through environment-specific sensory return, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (message delivery) tightens via protagonist agency: solstice timing forces crystallization of stance. Cost unmistakable in dissolving memories ("scent of his cloak transmuted into glyphs") and physical vanishing. Pressure accumulates through harmonic resonance altering gravity (blossoms falling upward).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: loom's transformation from cloth-weaving to threshold-weaving reweights "impossible distance." Final image ("essence woven into every star") offers resonant answer to separation without moralizing, leveraging prior tapestry motifs for conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "minutes pooled like spilled ink" reflects weaver's tactile cognition. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented syntax during dissolution ("She didn’t weep. Tears would unravel the weave"). Purposeful elision of courier's fate taught early and paid off in solstice climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor figurative density in opening ("silence clung like moss—raveling silence") risks muddle but resolves into precise action. Zero scaffold in closure beats; "plum blossoms fell upward" achieves crystalline propulsion. Final line's "hush of time’s unraveling tapestry" recharges motif without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving metaphysics: puzzle runes as "emotional frequencies" transforms trope through specific mechanics. Risk-taking (weaving self into thresholds) heightens stakes coherently, with dissolution details ("humming carrying what body could not hold") avoiding abstraction. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
