<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "steadily curious, never frantic" amid physical strain; micro-choices like humming through cracked voice reveal character under pressure without diagnostic labels. Slight underdevelopment of curiosity's cost keeps it from 9.5.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "Zeta slumped... arrow tip cooling" crystallizes exhaustion after the bell's metallic sigh. Orientation is rock-solid by line 3 (who/where/when anchored), and Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the final glyph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The acid sea and workshop aren't backdrop but active constraints: Zeta's clanking landing and "acid-resistant paint" notes show environment shaping tactics. Final image charged by the bell's "metallic sigh" against corrosive tides, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Zeta's agency: the kaleidoscope's accelerating spin forces vocal strain ("voice cracked"), narrowing options until the final spiral. Cost is visceral in her slumped posture and cooling arrow tip, reweighting the "whisper for the next one" under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"longing encoded in motion," not binaries"—and the ending reweights the premise with "irreverently, awesomely" resonance. No moralizing; the bell's sigh offers a non-literal answer to yearning's cost without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: mechanical metaphors ("banked toward the workshop bobbing like a drunken cog-toy") and sensory compression under stress ("hummed matching tones into a copper horn"). Rhythm modulates perfectly from lyrical opening to staccato climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or plot. "Cities built from sighs" risks overwriting but earns its place through kaleidoscopic logic. Final propulsion ("carry the next note farther") charges closure without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk and emotional algorithms avoids tropes: the hunter's arrow tip as organic memory source transforms "yearning" into tangible mechanics. Risk-taking in tone ("irreverent awe") heightens stakes without gimmickry, though not quite transcendent.</comment>
