<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (seeking silence while disrupting it); embodied emotion ("lungs empty, heart full") avoids labels. Final choice earned through prior causality, but ghost's opacity slightly weakens relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("trembling, lungs empty"); Accumulative lens holds via sensory density escalation. One meaningful tightening (lantern at 37°) suffices, though opposition remains environmental rather than active.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Water itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (wading, lantern angle) and charges final image ("water now warm"). "Submerged velvet seats" and "mold-streaked walls" filter through musician’s sensory hierarchy with professional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency (mirroring gestures), but opposition lacks active resistance beyond environmental pressure. Cost ("lungs empty") is palpable, though escalation remains atmospheric rather than confrontational under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (playing without instrument), not abstraction. Final line ("the flood, at last, had composed its masterpiece") reframes water as creative force without moralizing—resonant non-literal answer to "absences holding truth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("spaces between notes," "hollows beneath stages"); rhythm modulates with stress (short sentences during climax). Slight register drift in "cryptic images only she could decipher" nears academic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "magnifying the stains into shimmering glyphs" demonstrates high density. Minor overwriting risk in "trembling resonance of her cello’s mute body strapped to her back like armor" (near-mixed metaphor), but clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Flood-as-composer transforms disaster tropes with specific logic ("stains were sheet music, rewritten by erosion"). Emotional truth in "silence no longer hollow but humming" avoids abstraction, while risk-taking (wordless climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
