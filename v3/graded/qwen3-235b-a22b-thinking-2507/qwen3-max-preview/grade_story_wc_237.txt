<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (scholar vs. buried superstitions), embodied scars motivate micro-choices like humming lullaby under stress; no secondary character needed. Final renunciation of shame earns closure but lacks one visible flaw compounding earlier stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: scars remain but transform into "waypoints" with visible conceptual cost ("stories do not erase pain — they alchemize it"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via ink crystallization threat and humming intervention, narrowing options to breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (floating rock platform) constrains every choice: ink crystallizes mid-air, tea mirrors sky only after transformation. Final image charges closure—tea reflecting "sky" not fear—while crow quill’s "bird’s beak parting fog" embodies the ritual’s fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming scars) tightens via crystallizing ink—a visible constraint requiring active humming solution. Cost is legible: Elira sheds "brittle shell of shame" but scars persist, reweighting options through the final "breathe" rune’s release of the world’s held breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from scars-to-stories alchemy; final line avoids moralizing by showing transformation ("turning what was rigid into rhythm"). Resists sentimentality—scars "shimmer" as "waypoints," not erased—yet nearly slips into thematic echo with "alchemize it" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite: scholar’s tactile focus on ink’s "midnight moss" hue and quill’s "yielding" tip. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks with "humming... vibration only she and the wind could feel," compressing stress without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crystallized when stressed" trait drives causal pressure. Near-deduction for "alchemize it" abstraction in final line, but saved by preceding concrete action ("tea rippled, then stilled"). Propulsion flawless despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenuity in fusing rune-writing ritual with trauma alchemy—no stock metaphors. Fresh inflection: scars becoming "stanza[s]" via crow-feather courage. Derivative risk avoided by grounding magic in embodied stakes (burns, trembling hands).</comment>
