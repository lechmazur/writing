<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("gnarled from decades of weaving resistance into ritual"), but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle. Micro-choices like "placed the embryo... not to take, not to control" show value hierarchy yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density builds through glyph-decoding to Charged Poise closure where "seedlings pushed through ash-rich earth" reconfigures destiny with felt cost ("joints creaking like old timber"). Orientation anchored by "volcanic hot springs" in opening line; cost crystallized in "refused to let silence be the final tradition."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Volcanic springs function as micro-setting that charges closure: steam "bubbled clearer" post-ritual while obsidian stone's warmth enables the unsealing. Sensory hierarchy shines through grandmother's plant-telepathy ("vines tightened... to steady her"), with sulfurous vents constraining choices via soil memory. Final seedlings' emergence roots theme in tangible transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (evolving tradition vs. enforced silence) tightens meaningfully when glyph-decoding shifts from "seventeen moons" labor to active unsealing. Cost is unmistakable in "refused" stance crystallizing into physical action; the "quiet recalibration" reweights options through soil memory rather than combat. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image of children finding "leaves unfurling in shapes no botanist could name" delivers non-literal answer to "can tradition evolve?" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "implanted destiny" becomes "possibility rooted in soil" via amber's dissolution. Avoids Thematic Echo by having grandmother "answer... with tools" rather than stating the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct through plant-whisper lexicon ("sighs and shivers," "thoughts brushing... like moss") and rhythmic control during ritual ("not by force, not by prayer, but by understanding"). Voice modulates perfectly from "brittle parchment" tension to "quiet recalibration" cadence. No head-hopping; compression taught early via glyph descriptions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "vines erupted... coiling gently around her wrists" merges action/image/theme. One paraphrase loop ("destiny unchosen is no destiny at all... understanding, she had learned") costs 0.3. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final line's "stubborn belief" crystallizes concept through concrete verbs ("weaving," "pushed," "unfurling").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "accidentally telepathic" trope into profound soil-memory metaphor where "evolution is not rebellion’s opposite, but its deepest form." Fresh synthesis: "embryo in amber" becomes collective possibility rather than chosen-one device. Avoids derivative safety through "ash-rich earth" specificity and grandmother's quiet insurgency.</comment>
