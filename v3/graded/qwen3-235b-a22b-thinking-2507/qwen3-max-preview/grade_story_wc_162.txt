<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in logbook reveal ("her own handwriting"), where shock and recognition drive her final choice. "Featherly determined" slightly abstracts embodied resolve, but wood-grain analysis grounds her method in character-particular grief. Final renunciation of physical form earns cost through father's sacrifice parallel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands via "weight of what’s willingly left behind," with bench’s creak embodying conceptual cost. Fractured valley backdrop deepens the Accumulative lens without causal breaks. Orientation anchored by word 10 ("drifting prism terrace hovered"), avoiding penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bench’s wood grain functions as essential micro-setting, constraining her decoding method and charging the final creak as relief. Terrace’s rainbow mist vividly sets tone but lacks active pressure on choices. Sensory specificity ("tears traced cold paths") elevates embodied urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred thresholds) tightens through logbook’s emotional barometer revelation, narrowing options to surrender. Cost crystallizes in bench’s creak as "sighing in relief," reweighting sacrifice under Accumulative lens. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grain analysis and logbook metaphors, avoiding direct statement. Final image ("stepping off... unfolding into light") reweights thresholds as embodied sacrifice, not abstract philosophy. No moralizing; cost resonates in "weight of what’s willingly left behind."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in wood-grain chronology and emotional weather codes. Rhythmic control shines in high-pressure beats ("She closed her eyes... wood’s memory rise like sap"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via fragmented time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "grief absorbed into cellulose" does triple duty (character/world/theme). Minor vagueness in "featherly determined" avoids overwriting penalty. Final line’s creak delivers closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corn mazes as structural metaphors for causality. Risk-taking in Accumulative lens heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swapping "prism terrace" for generic "floating island" would break the story’s emotional geometry.</comment>
