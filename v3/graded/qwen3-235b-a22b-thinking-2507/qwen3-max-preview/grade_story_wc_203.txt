<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in sensory observation ("dust curled away like fleeing children") and micro-choices (barrel angle, evidence bag ritual) earns closure. Contradiction between professional detachment and emotional engagement feels authentic, though deeper internal conflict beyond witnessing could elevate cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "responsibility to notice" crystallizes when ghosts "lingered, lighter" post-acknowledgment. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—dust patterns tighten pressure toward ceiling discovery without causal breaks. Orientation clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dust patterns) constrains all choices: barrel reflection reveals footsteps, drives prying tile. Final water-drop image charges closure through tactile specificity ("vibrated in his molars"). Slight genericism in "fleeing children" metaphor prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening—ceiling tile revelation—narrows options to witnessing vs. ignoring, with cost crystallized in "weightless burden." Stakes ("discover what ceilings hide") deepen through agency (prying tile), though external pressure could heighten tension slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of "ghosts haunt neglect" emerges through concrete action (documenting dust patterns), not abstraction. Final image ("building keeping vigil") offers non-literal answer to "what silence smothers" without moralizing—resonant closure through the water drop’s purity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: technician’s horologist-trained eye filters details ("tilt of ticket stub," "dust accumulation patterns"). Voice modulates under pressure—"breath shallow as dust rained"—with zero POV slippage. Slight abstraction in "weightless burden" limits 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "pearl button, still gleaming" exemplifies high-density prose. "Ghost of glitter" avoids purple prose through earned specificity. Minor abstraction in "responsibility: to notice..." costs 0.1, but final line ("tucking in a child") delivers flawless cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes via dust-as-memory; technician’s witness role feels fresh. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, no dialogue) heightens stakes through "weightless burden" synthesis. Emotional truth in daughter’s photo detail avoids gimmickry, making closure inevitable.</comment>
