<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied trait ("wilts near dishonesty") drives credible choices; micro-choices like damp cloth breathing reveal hierarchy of values. "Relief — candor in small moments" risks label-speak but countered by visceral reversal when letters restore color to her cheeks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "the lost conversations hadn’t vanished. They’d been waiting — not for rescue, but for witness." Final image of her becoming the archive crystallizes the shift from search to stewardship under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting actively constrains choices: toxic sky's "ambient untruths" trigger physical wilting, while moss-covered vents hum to guide her. Final image of "emerald haze" recharges truth-as-water motif with ecological cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: wilting reverses only when reading unsent letters, proving truth's physical cost. Dominant stake (recovering lost conversations) narrows to bearing witness, with "toxic sky" imposing conceptual price on the final archive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "oasis would refill — not with water, but with truth, drop by drop." Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "lost conversations" as societal sustenance without abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: calligrapher notices "ligatures of longing" and "zinc fragment cold against her palm." Rhythmic control peaks in chamber scene where "voice steadying" mirrors emotional reversal. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor density issues: "neon orchids under UV lamps" risks touristy observation. Otherwise clean propulsion—"humming faintly when held near moss-covered vents" integrates action and setting. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligrapher-as-truth-seer: "ligatures of longing" transforms trope through specific emotional syntax. Risk-taking (truth as physical substance) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "drop by drop" reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
