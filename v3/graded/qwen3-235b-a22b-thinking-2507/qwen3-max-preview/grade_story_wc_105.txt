<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "harvested the silence" micro-choice balancing grief and purpose, though "alchemy of grief" edges toward thematic summary. Embodied emotion via neural grafts ("crimson of dying roses as cello note") avoids stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "leaving the forge to cool, its ashes now sacred" forecloses her path with visible cost (hunger-scars, cell-division countdown). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening to the "crack" fracture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shipwrecks aren't backdrop—they constrain choice when "rustled hulls resonated with the imprint," charging the final image. Greenhouse vines tightening "like tendons" during climax reweights prior fragility into active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through agency: feeding sister's absence to forge narrows options, with cell-division "countdown" making cost visceral. Pressure intensifies via sensory deepening ("indigo deepened to mourning bass") not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars: "memory-catcher tuned to frequency of fracture" rejects restoration, offering resonant non-literal answer to "sound before everything fell apart" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is airtight—synesthesia ("violet as whispering hum") filters every detail. Rhythm mirrors fracture in "crack. Not loud. Not dramatic." with no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ash curled upward, catching auroral light" achieves triple duty (image/sound/cost). Minor register drift in "harvested the silence" barely dents propulsion during high-pressure climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radical synthesis: hearing aid designer forging trust's frequency via neural grafts transforms tropes. "Burning absences" isn't quirky—it's the only logical extension of her grief-as-guidance premise with conceptual integrity.</comment>
