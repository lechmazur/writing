<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("transpose life into a new key") remains abstract without contradictory impulses tested under pressure; his quiet competence lacks visible struggle or flawed judgment during key moments like the storm arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the analyst's "You're conducting" crystallizes Elias's role with conceptual cost (his revolution observed but unclaimed), though the storm arrival relies on coincidence rather than earned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse beam functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (timed with lunar phases) and charging the final image ("slicing the dark like a conductor’s baton"); tide charts and typewriter actively shape tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (orchestrating hope) are clear but pressure never tightens; the storm arrival is coincidental rather than a meaningful deepening, and no visible cost alters Elias's tactics despite his "orchestration" claims.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("The map is not the shore—but the tide believes it is"), avoiding moralizing; the final line reweights the central question through image, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rhythm of waves, of wind, of words that bent reality") with rhythmic control under pressure; omniscient POV maintains consistent focalization without leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor syntactic repetition ("kept the light turning, kept the fortunes flowing") in high-pressure beats, but exceptional density—every line multiplies meaning without figurative muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through fortune-cookie conceit; "spycraft specs as Rosetta Stone" feels fresh, though "cryptic keeper" echoes existing archetypes without sufficient differentiation.</comment>
