<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "yearned not for vengeance, nor even clarity, but for quiet architecture of redemption" crystallized through bone-setting histories. Micro-choices like pressing thumbs into soil while murmuring syllables reveal shrewd innocence with embodied cost. No second character needed; single-POV baseline excels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the tooth's pulse reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("for what might still be born"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly: each sensory detail (backward clocks, ozone/cinnamon) tightens the redemption stake. Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Garden micro-setting constrains choice: backward clocks force time-recomposing, moss alcoves enable bone-setting. Tooth charges closure as heartbeat metaphor. Sensory details purposeful ("air smelled of cinnamon/ozone—nostalgic innovation"), never decorative. Final pulse makes environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen accumulatively: hollow chest cavity shatters the town's myth, narrowing options to recomposition. Protagonist's agency—endurance through teaching—carries visible cost ("cleft in certainty... now breathes"). Escalation driven by her method, not coincidence; cost unmistakable in final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from bone-setting motif: "turn mistakes into constellations" literalized by arranging "jagged edges of error." Final image ("tooth pulsed... for what might still be born") reweights grief without moralizing. Avoids false balance—myth shattered, yet redemption requires sacred tending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: notices "porcelain eyes staring blankly," "vines stirred." Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences: "Vines stirred. Petals shivered."). No head-hopping; stress compresses diction ("not to mourn, but to understand") while maintaining voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("wax limbs cracked, porcelain eyes staring" does triple duty). Final line avoids cliché with visceral specificity ("pulsed once... for what might still be born"). Figurative language precise—"shard of moonlight" never muddles pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</comment>Transcends changeling trope: redemption via "bone setting of histories" feels inevitable. Fresh angle—stolen things become sacred through tending, not reclaiming. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes; emotional truth in "mothers rocking empty arms called 'almost mine'."</question><grade>9.4</grade>
