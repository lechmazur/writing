<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Worker's "arboreal" motivation is concrete and character-particular; micro-choices like whispering "Show me" reveal authentic contradiction between technician and pilgrim identities under pressure. Final renunciation of fixing for remembering earns visible cost through identity shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: dream fragments accumulate pressure toward Charged Poise closure where sketching sorrow onto leaf veins reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors within 50 words; astronomer's vanishing lacks one concrete detail for perfect causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sextant (recurring object) charges final image as worker maps "quantified sorrow onto rings no axe would ever split." Sensory selection narrows under pressure—only tactile/auditory details during repair—while "rain-slicked parchment" shows weather altering action. Fully meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (can sorrow be mapped?) deepens when sextant shifts from measuring stars to measuring grief, narrowing options to "follow it." Cost is visible in worker's transformed identity: "She wasn’t fixing anything anymore. She was remembering for them." Perfect Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"widow pressing cheek to oak bark"—avoiding moralizing. Final image of "rings no axe would ever split" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question. Near-flawless execution; slight sentimentality in "mercifully mapped" prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: technical ("fractured degree-mark") blends with poetic ("moonlight pooled... strangely alive"). Rhythm modulates from dense description to short sentences at climax. One borderline clinical phrase ("quantified sorrow") slightly disrupts voice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("Each screw... came loose like a sigh released"). Final line's crystalline rhythm ("mundane, miraculous... mapped") avoids overwriting. Deduction only for "hairline fractures" bordering cliché, though context redeems it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sextant measuring sorrow via tree memories transforms tropes. Emotional truth in "girl who never spoke but painted stars" avoids sentimentality. "Quantified sorrow" concept slightly familiar but redeemed by concrete stakes.</comment>
