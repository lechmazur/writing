<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in juxtaposing play/gravity ("hopscotch board spelling 'FORGIVE ME'"), with micro-choices like timing messages for school bells. Earned closure via endurance of impermanence, though limited external/internal behavior contrast slightly softens the final beat's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "half-gone, half-alive" messages crystallize stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (widow's message climax), but minor causality dip in backstory integration prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (analog-only tool) and charges the final image ("tucked under her arm"). Sensory hierarchy masterful: "scent of cedar pencils" filters professional bias while "chalk-scraping ritual" mirrors emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through agency—each chalk example (birthday maze, widow's message) narrows her emotional options. Cost ("Chalk faded. Rain came.") is unmistakable, though the single-stake focus prevents 9.5-tier escalation complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("pastel smudges... waiting to be resurrected") offers non-literal answer to "where meaning hides," reweighting the arcade's "cathedral of lost connections" with earned ambiguity. Zero moralizing; theme emerges solely through sidewalk scribbles' fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "symbols only children could decode" and "ghosts of analog commerce." Rhythmic control peaks at "Chalk faded. Rain came. Children grew."—compression that heightens pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line multiplies meaning ("pneumatic tubes now decorative" implies obsolescence). Final sentence achieves crystalline propulsion: "not digital, but drawn—with care, with chalk..." integrates theme, voice, and closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "messenger" trope through specific, risky lens: chalk codes for children reframe nostalgia as active resistance. Fresh inflection in "juxtapose innocence with gravity" feels inevitable, though slight familiarity in "misrouted letter" backstory caps innovation.</comment>
