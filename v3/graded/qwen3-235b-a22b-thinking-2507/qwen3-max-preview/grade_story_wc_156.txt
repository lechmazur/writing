<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids labels through embodied choices: pressing palm "not to command, but to invite," then laughing as garden resonates. Final heartbeat in D-minor proves earned transformation from certainty to curiosity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mural "awakened" into Elira with visible cost (hobo nickel gone, river stone in pocket). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; cost proof in "heartbeat echoed in D-minor" crystallizing surrender.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains every choice: brass petals force reflected sound method, stone benches amplify whispers. Micro-setting (hobo nickel) literally unlocks closure—dissolving into mural charges final image with river stone’s B-flat hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stake ("awakening through ricochet, not direct contact") tightens via protagonist agency: flicking nickel triggers inward spiral. Cost is visceral—surrendering certainty (trading nickel for stone) forecloses her restorer identity with palpable weight in "weightless terror of no fixed identity."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: nested awakenings sequence (lullaby → rain taste → identity loss) reweights "curiosity over certainty" without moralizing. Final heartbeat in D-minor offers resonant, non-literal answer to "what is awakening?" avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "measuring decibel decay with a grin," "humming counter-melodies." Voice modulates under pressure ("Nothing. Then a single note") with rhythmic control. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "pause between question and reply" framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; propulsion through layered verbs: "ripples of ultrasonic blue," "folding through the garden’s architecture." Final line ("fell silent again—not empty, but waiting") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. One near-duplicate ("methodically playful" repetition) costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magical garden" trope via sonic physics: nested awakenings feel earned through specific sensory stakes (basslines brittle with grief). Emotional truth in "weightless terror of no fixed identity" avoids abstraction; river stone’s hum risks lyricism but charges closure coherently.</comment>
