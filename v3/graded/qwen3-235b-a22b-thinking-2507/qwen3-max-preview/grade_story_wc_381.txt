<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her shift from silencing to cradling the prophecy, with embodied micro-choices (palms lifting to receive, breath syncing to brook) revealing hierarchy of values. Slight abstraction in "soul alight with quiet purpose" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "knees damp with dew and resolve" crystallizes the cost of ongoing guardianship. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shifts like the whisper’s "memory given motion" reweighting the prophecy’s meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must match its lullaby cadence) and charges the final image ("brook sighed in gratitude"). "Terrestrially cosmic rhythm" merges scale with tactile immediacy, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when the whisper reconfigures the prophecy from doom to plea, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in "damp with dew and resolve"—the burden of returning nightly—but could resonate more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final line ("silence that makes space for stars to speak") offers a resonant non-literal answer to "how to hear truth too heavy for direct tongue," avoiding moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the origami wing’s transformation into lullaby-light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: "water’s murmur flowed not as sound but as texture" filters reality through her embodied practice. Rhythmic control under pressure (short clauses during prophecy unraveling) achieves lyrical precision without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "paper fibers drinking moonlight like roots drink rain" exemplifies high-density imagery. "Velvet void where meaning pooled" risks purple prose but is redeemed by context—only hairline slip preventing 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "silence as action" trope through specific mechanics (mapping stillness between cricket chirps) and emotional truth in "truth had grown too heavy for direct tongue." Fresh synthesis of cosmic/mundane in "terrestrially cosmic" elevates risk-taking.</comment>
