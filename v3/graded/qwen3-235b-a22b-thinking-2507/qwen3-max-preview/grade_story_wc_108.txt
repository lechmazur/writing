<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: "trembling certainty is my armor" concretizes fear/vulnerability duality. Micro-choices like decoding smudged notes reveal adaptive hierarchy of values. Only flaw: mentor's betrayal lacks on-page demonstration beyond exposition, slightly weakening motivation causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "walking not as a stunt double... but as someone firmly adaptive" crystallizes stance shift with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors instantly ("rusted library," "phobia-ridden stunt double"). Accumulative lens holds through decryption-to-burning escalation, though transition from library to projector room lacks spatial tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (seashell/cast) charges closure: "softest parts hold sharpest truths" reweights the shell's final silence. Library's "splintered floorboards" and "rusted holes" constrain movement but underutilize spatial pressure—collapsing astronomy section doesn't actively hinder climax. Sensory detail vivid yet selective ("ink bleeding through plaster like regret").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: decryption transforms "velvet-wrapped poison" into actionable knowledge, narrowing options to burn footage. Cost is legible in "trembling certainty" becoming identity. "Firmly adaptive" trait forces trade-offs (vulnerability as power vs. survival instinct), with conceptual price paid via destroyed evidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the crack through which truth enters" dramatized through physical acts (decoding, burning), not stated. Final image ("night air tastes like salt and second chances") reweights seashell motif without moralizing. Avoids false balance—betrayal's cost is undeniable, no redemption for mentor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ink bleeding through plaster like regret" filters setting through trauma. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in fragmented syntax ("I rise, knees cracking like dry kindling"). Slight register drift in "move like fear given legs" borders on cliché, diluting voice specificity during high-stakes movement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("velvet-wrapped poison" compresses betrayal). Final deduction for one borderline metaphor ("heart hammering a rhythm only the stars can count") in climax beat. Opening line ("rusted library groaned under forgotten stars") exemplifies textural propulsion. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms stunt-double trope through "phobia-ridden" specificity and "trembling certainty" motif. Emotional truth anchors freshness: vulnerability as power reframed via bodily trauma. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Near-echo of "burning evidence" climax slightly familiar but redeemed by seashell's charged reprise.</comment>
