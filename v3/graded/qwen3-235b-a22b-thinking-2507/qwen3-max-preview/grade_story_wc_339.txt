<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (e.g., analytic precision vs. whispering sister's name), with final release earned by prior causality; minor thinness in sister's backstory avoids diagnostic label-speak but lacks fuller emotional friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—globe vanishing after release crystallizes letting go's cost (hollow/humming)—under Accumulative lens; orientation anchored early via "I found it after locating Amelia Earhart’s plane," though lunar perigee detail slightly over-engineers escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow globe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (lab obsession, cliffside release) and charges final image (floating/vanishing); "mercury" seal and "blizzard synchronized with my pulse" exemplify tactile specificity driving stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: analytic resistance to "letting go" forecloses path via physical decline (stopping eating/sleeping), culminating in earned renunciation with visible cost (hollowness); lunar perigee mechanic slightly overcomplicates pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (globe’s upward-falling flakes) and final image (thread snapping = love as pattern, not possession); avoids moralizing while reweighting "physics of letting go" via sister’s ashes scene without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("Death... acquaintance over coffee") persists under stress; syntax compresses ("Stopped eating. Stopped sleeping.") without voice erosion; Amelia’s imagined dialogue carries subtext while maintaining focalization integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "blizzard now synchronized with my pulse" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; minor register drift with "recalibration" (8.3% into climax) avoids jargon by immediate concrete rephrasing ("mass converting to light").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics/grief via snow globe as emotional receiver; transforms "letting go" trope through specific lived detail (0.3°C temp drop whispering names), with risk-taking (metaphysical climax) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
