<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sincerely insincere") and embodied emotion ("toes gripping cold rock") drive micro-choices under pressure; cloak struggle earns change through prior causality with visceral cost ("skin prickled... trembling"). Slight abstraction in "protected vulnerability" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise Resonant Reconfiguration: barefoot descent crystallizes reweighted stakes with undeniable cost (exposed skin, ash-erased footprints). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly; seashell payoff earned by "tide or wind" phrasing avoids convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse balcony actively constrains choice (railing snagging cloak hem) and charges closure ("barefoot descent," tide erasing footprints). Micro-setting (chimes, mirror shard) directly shapes pivotal unhooking beat with salt-air exposure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) tightens via chime sequences forcing single decisive action. Cost is visceral (trembling exposure) and professional (clients walking away); agency entirely protagonist-driven with "velvet thing" struggle narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (seashell, "offer a question") provides non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through action (unhooking = welcoming nuance); avoids thematic echo via concrete particulars ("erasing footprints," "cold ash").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chimes spoke in selections," "sigh like long-held breath") with rhythmic control during unhooking ("nails digging... yanked"). Minor deduction for borderline elevated "velvet thing" phrasing in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trembled, not from wind, but from memory" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight deduction for adjacent "sincerely insincere" repetition (0.2) though offset by strategic telling compressing backstory.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "shedding baggage" trope via specific occupational detail ("ethical arbitration," wartime code); fresh inflection in "sincerely insincere" professional identity. Lighthouse setting slightly familiar but redeemed by concrete constraints (crumbling stone, tide action).</comment>
