<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "willingly perplexed" gaze and surrender versus reclaiming lost moments; embodied emotion via wrist tattoo and inked tracings. Minor flaw: cartomancer identity lacks occupational pressure on choices despite onyx-ink recurrence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost ("final unfastening of her grip") under Accumulative lens. The saucer's healing crystallizes surrender's weight, and "child's voice called—not from memory" reconfigures time's patience with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the saucer crack constrains five pivotal choices (withdrawal, placement, threshold passage, blessing, healing) and charges the final image as "compass, covenant." Moss actively pulls her downward, evolving from passive ground to active memory conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) tightens through protagonist agency—her whispering summons clouds, crawling through the saucer forecloses holding time. Cost is legible in "surrender" sealing the crack, though emotional weight slightly outweighs tangible tactical shift at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through saucer's evolution: "anchors rust" becomes "compass, covenant" without moralizing. Final image—"ink would not dry before the kiss"—resonantly answers "time's theft" through concrete action, avoiding abstraction while embracing loss's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "porcelain fissure whispering miniature tragedies" and rhythm shifts under pressure ("She did not resist. She crawled forward"). No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("birth of silence") pays off in glade's sentient response.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "burnt sugar" and "onyx ink smudged with earth" exemplify textural specificity. Minor deduction for verbatim "choking beauty" repetition in high-pressure beats, slightly muddling emotional escalation at 72%.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tropes: time as "spilled ink," repentance as cloudbound, saucer as time-threshold. Risk-taking (celestial glade, spectral hands) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making emotional truth feel newly excavated from universal loss.</comment>
