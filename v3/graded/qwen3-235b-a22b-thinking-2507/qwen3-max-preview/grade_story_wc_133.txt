<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "wryly earnest" demeanor masking spiritual desperation; micro-choices like whispering to brooch reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost during painting failures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: relinquishing the brooch forecloses meaning-making path with visceral cost ("she didn't paint. She prepared an exchange"), under Accumulative lens where density shift crystallizes grief-as-legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tidal island functions as active constraint: rain trails guide discovery, salinity-defying well enables survival, and cairn location pressures exchange ritual; final seaglass recharges setting’s thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation—brooch’s fractal shadows and journal discovery reweight "threshing meaning" into legacy preservation, with cost legible in her shift from creation to ritual surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "grief becomes legacy" crystallizes via exchange ritual, avoiding moralizing; final image ("tide kept secrets—until it didn’t") reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ocean as librarian of loss" metaphors; rhythmic control peaks during hallucination sequence with fragmented syntax mirroring sleep deprivation’s cognitive decay.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "bruised clouds" and "barnacle-crusted cairn"; figurative language ("third eye watching her fail") deepens pressure without muddle in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms water-war tropes through specific tactile details (oilcloth journal, kelp-bedded exchange); emotional truth in "haggard awe" avoids generic melancholy while risking lyrical structure.</comment>
