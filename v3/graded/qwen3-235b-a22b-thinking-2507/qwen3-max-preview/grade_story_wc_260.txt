<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("self-respect vs compassion") drives micro-choices like pigment mixing, with embodied emotion ("conviction cracked like thin ice"). Final resignation/rebuilding choice is earned through tail-reconstruction ritual, avoiding over-tidiness by embracing "reconstruction not redemption." Only minor flaw: "fragile convictions" phrasing slightly edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: resignation + care plans crystallize stance with visible cost ("funded by savings and sweat"). Orientation anchors in opening line ("moss-stained floorboards"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each resin layer tightens emotional stakes toward starlight-balm realization. Cost proof: "self-respect no longer demanded purity; it demanded presence" legibly reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: brazier embers and lantern halos constrain choices (pigment mixing in low light), charging the final "starlight fill" image. Workshop tools (resin, quartz pigments) directly enable the reconstruction ritual. Misses 9+ by hair—mist/stars remain atmospheric rather than pressuring actions, though the tail-case placement uses spatial choreography purposefully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize immediately ("abandon creatures vs become complicit"), with accumulation-driven escalation: each pigment blend deepens resolve. Agency shines through quiet choices (drafting care plans, anonymous testimony). Cost is undeniable—"funded by savings and sweat" shows concrete sacrifice. Avoids causal traps; tension operates at sentence level ("conviction cracked like thin ice") and story scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: tail regeneration mirrors Elara’s "reconstruction." Final line "dawn would come" reweights opening stars with earned hope, avoiding moralizing. "Redemption implied erasure" is character-particular insight, not platitude. No thematic echo—the "shimmering stillness" image charges the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("scales still faintly iridescent under lantern’s glow"), with rhythm modulating to pressure—longer sentences during reflection, clipped phrases during action ("She lit a small brazier"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as stress mounts. Minor deduction for "keratin and color" slightly academic for handler POV, but forgivable in reflective moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances meaning ("memories surfaced—not of board meetings... but of dawn feedings"). "Twilight violet fading to dawn-gold" shows exceptional density. Only flaw: "conviction—once sturdy as oak—had cracked like thin ice" slightly muddles metaphor (oak vs ice), costing 0.4 in peak tension beat without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms sanctuary trope through specific, verifiable details (lichen pigments, shed skins on workbench). Tail-as-compass is fresh without gimmickry—removing it would break closure’s emotional logic. Risks quiet ending but pays off with "fragile convictions remade scale by scale." Transformation test passed: wouldn’t work with generic animal or handler.</comment>
