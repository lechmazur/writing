<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction ("scalpel, not a prank") but lacks simultaneous conflicting impulses during climax; the child scene reveals values yet final self-refraction lacks visceral struggle despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the spire's dissolution charges the cost of rejecting singular truth, with mist-thinning revealing grief-stricken face as conceptual repricing under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers function as micro-setting—artist presses palm to "cold ridge" during child's confession, directly constraining her tactile choice and charging the final dissolution image with residual grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's escalating agency: refracting strangers' regrets evolves to raw self-confession, narrowing options to "carrying broken pieces" with visible cost in the spire's shuddering dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted echoes ("confession became lullaby"), but "Forgiveness should never be cheapened" borders on thematic echo; final mist-smell avoids moralizing yet earlier abstraction dilutes resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "canyon’s echoes were still drowsy" and "mist pulsed like slow heartbeat"; rhythmic control intensifies during self-refraction ("gasp, hum, scream cut short by laugh") without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density falters in "glass birds nesting in rib cages" (figurative muddle); "rustled music box that played only silence" shows textural specificity, but minor scaffold in ritual bell description dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness trope through bone towers and echo physics; "dolls who forgive because they have no choice" offers fresh inflection, though spire's sentience leans slightly archetypal despite earned dissolution.</comment>
