<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (blithe yet grief-attuned), micro-choices under pressure evident when humming loosens green thread, but motivation for silo visit leans slightly abstract ("hollow hum beneath ribs"). Final shift from lullabies to questions earns change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "she saw it: the shape of intentions" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("intentions were not destinations"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but chess clock setup lacks payoff in pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that charges closure (trembling with release), sovereign case constrains choice (threading sleeve-fiber). "Liquid twilight" and thread textures filter through gardener's sensory priorities without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding intentions via threads) tightens through gardener's agency—humming to loosen knots, sleeve-threading choice. Cost legible in sovereign case's weight shift, but "uncharted echoes" concept remains slightly abstract until final revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "messy, overlapping spirals" reframes graves as "thresholds" without moralizing. Final whispering-to-stir-dead reweights prior lullabies as resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frayed threads, knotted like tangled nerves") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in closure ("she no longer saw graves. She saw thresholds.") with zero head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "burnt umber and brittle" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language ("threads curling like smoke") serves pressure without muddle. Final meteor image resolves with concrete propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Trope transformation: cemetery gardener’s textile metaphor synthesizes grief into "shape of intentions." Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal turns) heightens stakes coherently; no safety-middle hedging.</comment>
