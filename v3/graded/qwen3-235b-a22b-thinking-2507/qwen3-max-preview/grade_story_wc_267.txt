<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (safety vs music) manifest physically in trembling hands and bolt retrieval; final choice earned through nerve-regeneration stakes without diagnostic labels. Child’s arrival crystallizes hierarchy of values with visible cost in "safety cost everything if it cost silence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the piano note reconfigures safety’s meaning while the gold-flushing stain proves cost legibility. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density increase (dust dancing, child’s arrival) reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress actively constrains choices (boltless piano, snow-drifts); staircase stain functions as micro-setting charging the final image. Sensory details (cold biting skin, chandelier dust) reflect urgency without checklist clichés, meeting 9+ gate via environment altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (safety vs silence) tightens through child’s arrival forcing agency; cost is unmistakable in "safety cost everything if it cost silence." Escalation via accumulative pressure (stain’s color shift, trembling hands) reweights options under lens without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through piano bolt and stain—no moralizing. Final image ("space between notes, where safety and sacrifice finally met") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity ("silence, unpardonable as it was, could be broken").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frostbitten hope," nerve-regeneration lens) with rhythmic control in peak beats ("He pressed middle C. / The note rang out"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from "seraphically mundane" grace to fractured tension during bolt retrieval.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("dust danced in the chandelier’s glow" reweights closure). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle ("frozen hymn," "stain like dried ink"). Final line’s cadence delivers propulsion while charging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "silent-choir bellhop" avoids trope via nerve-regeneration specificity. Risk-taking (silence as antagonist) heightens stakes coherently; emotional truth in "hands still learning boundaries" resists generic templates. Transformation test passed—plot fails with generic mute protagonist.</comment>
