<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (wanting her voice vs. knowing echoes are false) embodied through "mournfully eager" actions like swaying to coax sound; "cracked and trembling" hands show grief without labels. Final endurance—"fragments are enough"—earns cost through visible choice to persist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: he keeps singing knowing echoes aren’t real, with cost legible in "fragments are enough to keep the dark from solidifying." Accumulative lens holds as sonic density escalates (giggle → laugh → "something like forgiveness"), narrowing his options to tending silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel constrains every choice—it amplifies sighs into hymns, forces him to "macerate silence," and charges the final image where laughter "bounces once, twice, then fades." Concrete acoustics (drafts as dirges, curved ribs fracturing notes) avoid symbolism clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via echo escalation: from "ghost of a chuckle" to a "full-bellied laugh" that drops him to his knees, narrowing his world to the tunnel’s false promises. Cost is visceral—"begging the concrete to give her back"—as stakes shift from seeking joy to enduring fragments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic particulars: "macerating silence until it bleeds sound" reframes grief as active labor. Final image—"echo of joy is still joy, even if borrowed"—avoids moralizing by embedding insight in his physical act of smiling while the tunnel shivers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: sound-focused lexicon ("metronomes," "harmonics only the hollow can hear") reflects his conductor past. Rhythmic control under pressure—staccato fragments ("He takes a breath. He begins to hum.")—mirrors his fractured state without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "macerates grief" risks purple prose but gains coherence via "macerates silence" later. "Off-key wind" and "pendulum counting down to nothing" avoid mixed metaphors. Final line’s "until the last echo forgets his name" charges closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via sonic specificity: leaf blower as "vessel" for memory, laughter as physics ("bounces once, twice"). Risk-taking (singing to echoes) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "pull cord handle clutched like a rosary" synthesizes mundane and sacred organically.</comment>
