<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("collects stories, not profit") and embodied grief (Leo's "gaunt, eyes hollow") drive credible micro-choices like imperfect humming. Contradictory impulses ("didn't touch it" vs. seeking resonance) deepen stakes, though Leo's interiority remains lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mailbox clicks "organically" as Leo weeps, reconfiguring grief with visible cost ("humming... no longer broken—just sad, and seen"). Orientation anchors by word 20 ("dawn, vibrant courtyard"), and accumulative lens holds through humming repetitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as active micro-setting: jasmine scent and mailbox constrain choices (dawn timing, ritual waiting), while the locket's "warmth in her palm" charges the closure image. Environment shapes tactics without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulative deepening: four dawns of humming narrow options toward Leo's weeping. Stakes (unresolved grief) viscerally materialize through the locket's humming and his "breath hitched." Agency-driven under accumulative lens with felt cost in closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through humming/locket reprise, avoiding moralizing. Final seashell ("sound of ocean waves") offers non-literal answer to "quiet exchanges," reweighting the premise without stated moral. No thematic echo; complexity lingers via "trauma doesn't shout—it echoes."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tarnished silver with hairline hinge fracture") and rhythmic control ("fluttering it like a trapped wing") persist under pressure. Purposeful compression (mailbox ritual) taught early; no head-hopping despite multi-POV hints.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "humming inside had softened... just sad, and seen" shows high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("wind catch the edge... fluttering it like a trapped wing") avoids muddle. Near-slip: "trauma doesn't shout" risks abstraction but remains character-bound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via specific rituals (mailbox mystery, humming methodology). "Leads through following" synthesizes emotional logic into fresh action. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
