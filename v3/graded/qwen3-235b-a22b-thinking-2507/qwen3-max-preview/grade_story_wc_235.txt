<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied choices (reaching for scroll vs. screaming at younger self), though single-character scope limits relationship crucible. Micro-choices under pressure—like writing jealousy raw—earn the final renunciation of clean endings with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density escalates through dream-self encounters to Charged Poise closure where the grave becomes "a footnote." Cost is legible in the scroll’s "warm as living skin" weight after distillation labor, though causal escalation lacks one tightening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (repelling then absorbing ink) and charges the final image ("humming against my thigh"). Sensory details like "pine resin and damp wool" filter through the chronicler’s fractured perception, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (taming feral nostalgia) tightens through protagonist’s agency—hunting selves in dreams fuels the scroll. Cost is felt in the ink’s "thick, black, hungry" flow, though escalation lacks one visible price altering tactics mid-beat before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the scroll’s transformation from "fossilized confession" to "cartography of collapse," rejecting tidy morals for "endings are just seams." Final image reweights time’s chaos without sermonizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("rabid, snarling recollections that bite") with rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure. No head-hopping, and diction stays within the chronicler’s poetic lexicon even during stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops in peak beats; "sinew from a dream-deer" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor paraphrase loop ("chronologically confused" repetition) costs -0.2 but avoids closure beat, preserving exceptional clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms time/memory tropes via "feral nostalgia" and birch bark cartography, with risk-taking (multi-self encounters) heightening stakes coherently. Emotional specificity in "jaded wonder" avoids abstraction, making the premise feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
