<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses shown; final vanishing lacks earned struggle despite calm mastery. "Perceptively calm" tells rather than embodies internal tension under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: mirrors transform with conceptual cost (grief yielding to possibility). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through resonant reconfiguration of light/memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Terrace/mirrors function as micro-setting charging final image ("alive with doorways"), but stone/rain don't constrain choices. Prism parapet's glyph-carved surface lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (showing possibility) tighten via mirror transformations, but escalation lacks narrowing options—no trade-off when borrowing heartbeat. Cost (tarnished mirrors now holding doorways) feels earned but not viscerally paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fractured prism" motif; final image ("dusky harmony") answers "what if fear loosened its grip?" non-literally without moralizing. Avoids false balance while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("marble tiles wept," "hollow between ribs") shines, but "steady as tide" slips into cliché. Rhythmic control under pressure (humming lullabies) avoids uniformity despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "perceptively calm" is label-only telling, and "steady as tide" dilutes embodied specificity. No loops, yet minor overwriting in heartbeat description slightly blurs pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light/mirrors/heartbeat transcends magical realism tropes, but "elusive painter" archetype lacks sufficient transformation. Risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
