<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "mend souls" line risks diagnostic label-speak; transformation earned through concrete actions (kissing child, mending sail) avoids thematic echo penalties despite near-miss phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("grace no longer armor, but invitation") reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through density escalation ("whale’s echo" → "carry hope") without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent kelp constrains Lira’s movement, while scrimshaw’s physicality (ridges biting palm) charges the dissolution climax and final "salt on skin" resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: "live small beneath vast sky" → "carry hope where wounded dare not tread"; cost crystallized when scrimshaw dissolves, making the island’s vanishing emotionally legible as earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through mended sail holding "longer than expected" and boy leaning into touch—concrete actions reweight "freedom is alignment" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite high-risk phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "tide-worn crates," "cold as regret" reflect dock worker’s embodied lexicon; rhythmic cadence ("salt and surrender") modulates stress without elision debt; zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "whispered trues" and "bruised indigo sky" achieve poetic density without muddle; only minor register drift in "mend souls" (elevated but justified by mythic context).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime myth and trauma recovery: disappearing island’s physics (receding with cruelty) transforms trope through specific emotional calculus; risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
