<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through concrete micro-choices (hairpin handling, trembling "from release"); contradictory impulses manifest in "scallop" metaphor and return to caretaking despite unhealed wounds. Slight over-tidiness in forgiveness arc limits 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost ("not lighter, but truer"/"heart a vessel not for sorrow"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation. Childhood reflection block risks BRR overreach but anchors to hairpin micro-choice, narrowly avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Umbral grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (enabling realization); hairpin's physical properties ("dulled by centuries but still sharp") charge closure. Vineyard hush motif evolves from description to thematic engine in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through quiet escalation: internal conflict (bitterness vs. contentment) tightens via reflection density, not external pressure. Cost legible in "refused to let [wound] define soul's shape" and enduring caretaking role. Lacks visible trade-off for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through hairpin's journey and "scallop" metaphor; final image ("vineyard hush that follows the storm") offers non-literal answer to contentment quest without moralizing. "Cycle of rebirth" phrasing slightly overstates but redeemed by "daily, quiet" execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bark like old promises," "wine settling in a cask") modulates with emotional intensity; rhythm shifts from staccato climb to flowing reflection. "Kindly decisive part" borders on diagnostic label but saved by "nodded once, firm as root" embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("glint, a pulse, a reminder") propels closure. Minor redundancy in "dulled by centuries but still sharp enough" triggers −0.1. Final line’s "carrying the scalloped peace" recharges motif with perfect precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief-caretaker trope through vineyard hush specificity and "scallop" as embodied processing method. Emotional truth anchors rebirth concept in "choosing to climb again." Avoids abstraction via hairpin’s physical journey; risk-taking elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
