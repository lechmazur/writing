<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("intimately aloof") and embodied emotion anchor micro-choices under pressure; final renunciation of the shell is earned through painting’s tactile ritual. Slight deduction for minimal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously during peak stress beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "reflection wasn’t in glass, but in motion" reweights the premise while the abandoned shell embodies irreversible change. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation to the whispered "I’m still here."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cave’s salt crystals and tidal threshold actively constrain choices (painting medium, exit timing), while the seashell’s final image charges closure by embodying preserved impermanence—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the "temporary eternity" deepens perception until the candle’s guttering crystallizes her stance. Cost is unmistakable in leaving the shell—a visceral forfeiture of carried meaning scaled perfectly to the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motion-as-reflection motif; the final dream of mineral-swallowed shell offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action ("brushstrokes, tides, wrong turns").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("water that no longer reflected the sky") and rhythmic control under pressure ("time stretched thin here") showcase voice cohesion. No head-hopping; elision of backstory is taught via concrete cues (cracked mirror, seashell).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trembling shadows that danced like figures from half-remembered dreams" exemplifies high-density prose with propulsion. Figurative language remains precise in peak beats without muddle or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms nostalgia tropes through "reflection in motion" synthesis; the cobalt shell’s mineral preservation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—freshness anchored in tactile specificity.</comment>
