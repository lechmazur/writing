<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("mapped stress fractures like poetry") but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear yet untested by internal conflict during pivotal steam redirection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with cost ("walls still cracked... but now it pulsed"), though personal stakes lack visceral escalation; Accumulative lens held through refracted light/steam motifs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terminal actively constrains choices (steam redirection through ducts) and charges final image (projected triangles), but cargo annex mention slightly tacked-on; micro-setting mastery in sextant's structural readings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally from measurement to community integration, yet "hope" remains abstract without tangible threat; cost legible in persistent cracks but lacks personal sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "redirected flows" metaphor; final equation avoids moralizing while reweighting decay as "breathing" with conceptual cost—textbook Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("load-bearing ghosts") shines, but "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" drifts into academic diction mid-lyric climax, slightly fracturing voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, yet minor paraphrase loop in "rerouting... repurposing... bending" and biologically impossible "breath returned to a corpse" metaphor dull closure’s physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms engineering tropes through "stoic wonder" lens; sextant-to-equation arc synthesizes entropy/architecture uniquely while resisting sentimental payoff—bold risk executed cohesively.</comment>
