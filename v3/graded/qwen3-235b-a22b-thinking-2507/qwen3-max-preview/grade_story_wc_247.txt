<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (joy/sorrow in creation) drive her signing choices; Silas applies pressure by reframing silence as canvas. Girl’s sudden appearance lacks sufficient setup for transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalates (gull cry → fisherman’s pause → girl’s trembling hands) to Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable in "vanish with tide, remembered by no one tomorrow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor functions as micro-setting: waves become "crescendo," rope creak "staccato," constraining Elara’s translation tactics. Final image charges the tide’s ephemerality as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through embodied pressure: fisherman feeling music "in his ribs," girl’s hesitant hands. Agency manifests as signing choices under Accumulative escalation; cost (art’s vanishing) reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "You are not broken. You are a symphony" shows rather than tells. Final echo in "girl’s heartbeat" answers central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV filters harbor through Elara’s artistic perception ("spilled mercury," "saw not images but vibrations"). Perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure; no head-hopping despite multi-character scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding: "moonlight brushed silver across his cheekbones" avoids cliché with concrete verbs. Slight overwriting risk in "joyful sorrow" mitigated by physical "glistening" eyes; no closure-impacting loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms sign language from communication to music composition; camera’s empty lens as framing device feels fresh. Risk-taking (ephemeral art) heightens stakes without gimmickry, rooted in harbor’s logic.</comment>
