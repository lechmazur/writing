<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "visceral" motivation versus academic rigor; embodied emotion in weeping "from recognition" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice to wait for dusk crystallizes stance with cost. Only minor flaw: "silence was not void but vessel" edges toward abstraction but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: shadow chapel materializes with undeniable conceptual cost ("silence had been speaking all along"). Accumulative lens holds from first video comparison through spiral revelation. Orientation anchored in opening line; cost legible in "wept, not from sorrow, but from recognition."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Vault actively constrains choices (damp vellum forcing precise alignment) and charges final image ("frescoes glistening"). Henge functions as micro-setting that shapes tactics—shadow migration guides tripod placement. Sensory hierarchy reflects cartographer's bias: "moss that bloomed in impossible symmetry" over generic weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to hear what stones refused to speak") tightens through footage comparisons into shadow's spiral. Agency in waiting for dusk crystallizes stance with visceral cost. Pressure grows via pattern break (organic spiral vs mathematical). Slight deduction: external conflict resolves neater than emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "map's deliberate tear" becomes "invitation, not boundary." Final image reweights silence as active presence without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "yarrow on central stone" ritual. Only hairline flaw: "truths are not uncovered but remembered" borders abstraction but grounded by action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: cartographer's precision ("fracture where ink bled into blankness"). Rhythm modulates from clinical short sentences ("It was choreography") to lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping; "metronome marking collapse" slightly elevated but voice-justified. Consistent lexicon avoids academic drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shadows shift—not with season or sun, but with something subtler" shows syntactic variety. Final line achieves rhythmic closure ("chapel still breathing—invisibly, audibly, eternally"). Deduction for "audibly" slightly straining silence motif but redeemed by context. Propulsion never flags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms archaeological trope via cartographer's lens: absence as active presence ("silence as vessel"). Emotional specificity in "silences had haunted her" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (pure observation, no dialogue) heightens stakes. Deduction: grandmother backstory slightly conventional though well-executed.</comment>
