<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied metaphors ("chest echoed like a cathedral"); contradictory impulses (craving peace vs. freeing others) drive the climax where she weeps during mass liberation. Flaw: near-archetypal purity slightly undermines "genuine struggle" requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the final harmony reconfigures the stardust motif with conceptual cost (exhaustion, frozen tears). Accumulative lens holds: stifled voices intensify to "symphony" then resolve as song. No orientation debt; drive lens clear by paragraph 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The brass instrument constrains choice (kneeling in snow to align lenses) and charges the final image ("finger still faintly tracing"). Aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting: its stone forces physical vulnerability during the climax, making liberation tactile. Sensory hierarchy perfectly mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: individual rest → town-wide liberation. The "symphony of stifled genius" tightens options to a single high-stakes act. Cost is unmistakable: her spent trembling and frozen tears reconfigure the dominant stake (freeing creativity) into earned harmony. No reversals needed per lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bread birds, overdue-notice sonnets. Final image ("stardust, sky, and silence in harmony") reweights the premise non-literally—liberation isn't triumph but exhausted resonance. Avoids moralizing; complexity in "raw, trembling, alive" song rejects simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is crystalline: "sighs of longing" from rusted gates, "cosmic midwife" lexicon. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical cadence ("stitching silver thread") to staccato urgency ("rattling her teeth"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via unwritten calendar.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; "frozen tears glittering like dew on spider silk" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language deepens pressure without muddle—even "cathedral of unfinished hymns" charges the ribcage metaphor. Final line’s "harmony" recharges opening stardust with earned weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through specific mechanics: tracing stars as cosmic midwifery, creativity freed via marginalia sonnets. Emotional truth in weeping during victory avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes—town liberation feels earned through baker/librarian seeds.</comment>
