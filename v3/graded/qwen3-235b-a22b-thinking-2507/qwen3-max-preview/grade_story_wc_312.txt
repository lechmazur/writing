<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "radiated neither frost nor flame" and "oven" simile; micro-choices (timing drips, resin pour) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in "months here, before dawn." Final renunciation of ringing the bell earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is masterful Charged Poise: bell's plunge triggers "ripple... sigh... first fish" with undeniable conceptual cost ("cosmic ledger nudged"). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly—dripping patterns accumulate pressure to reconfigure stakes. Orientation anchors by word 15; cost legible in "faithful, brittle devotion" payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct constrains every choice: "morning runoff" dictates resin hardening, "dew-slick stone" chills bare feet, and final "molten gold" stone charges closure. Micro-setting (dripping arches) directly alters tactics—no ornamental detail. Meets 9+ gate as environment shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: dripping-rate research deepens to resin-pouring climax. Cost is visceral in "months here, before dawn" and "breathing with the drops." "Brittle devotion" forecloses magical solutions, narrowing options to patient observation with felt cosmic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "not perfect. Not magical. But whole" reweights cosmic balance without moralizing. Final fish arcing "like a question mark" offers resonant answer to central query. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in "methodical measure of moisture," not abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "equations curling like vines," "breathing with the drops" reflects mage's methodical mind. Rhythm modulates from "hesitant plink" to "syncopated rhythm," mirroring tension. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in character's tactile, biased noticing ("puddles," "condensation").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("threadbare robe fluttering like a flag of surrender"). Figurative language serves pressure: "cosmic ledgers yawned open" crystallizes stakes. Final line "lukewarm, and utterly content" delivers perfect cadence shift with closure charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "repair quest" trope through science-poetry fusion: tidal coefficients as devotion, resin as "filaments thinner than spider silk." Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"methodical measure of moisture" feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh inflection in cosmic stakes resolved by mundane patience.</comment>
