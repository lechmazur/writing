<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rigid calculus vs fluid grace" choices, but lack of secondary character limits relationship crucible; embodied tremors and valve-tightening guilt avoid therapy-speak yet micro-choices stay narrowly focused on artifacts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("children downstream clutching empty buckets"), the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through harmonic resonance payoff, and the volcanic breath timing creates persistent constraint shaping her humming tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Surveyor's chain constrains every major choice—from measuring sorrow to harmonic calibration—and charges the final image (packing it "with reverence"), while volcanic breath literally powers the resolution; micro-setting functions as environment with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize viscerally through downstream children and elders' prayers, with her valve-tightening guilt creating tangible cost; escalation via harmonic resonance discovery narrows options under Accumulative lens, though one tightening suffices for this scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("mercy moving the gears") offers non-literal answer to central conflict without moralizing; theme emerges purely through cupped-hands carving and adhesive analysis, avoiding thematic echo while reweighting "encrypted compassion" as operationalized mercy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("geothermal sighs," "powdered rust") reflects engineer-poet duality; rhythmic compression during tremors avoids filter-verb stacks, and "slyly heartfelt" refrain modulates voice organically without head-hopping in this single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with "caramel smear on the inside flap" showing rather than telling regret; minor over-telling in "trembled—not from cold" deducts 0.2, but no loops or register drift dull the closure image of stepping into light.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms floodgate tropes through volcanic acoustics and "encrypted compassion" as physical residue; harmonic calibration feels inevitable in hindsight while risking lyric density that heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>
