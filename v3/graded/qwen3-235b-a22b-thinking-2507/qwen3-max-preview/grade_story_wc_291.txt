<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking empathy vs. rejecting justice) manifests in tactile choices; killer’s confession reveals embodied grief without diagnostic labels. Micro-choice placing palm over trembling hand crystallizes values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: masks unearthed yet cases legally unresolved, with cost legible in "tears cutting tracks through quarry dust." Accumulative lens holds as texture density reweights erasure stakes at dawn’s reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quarry’s mist constrains movement ("coiling around ankles"), limestone chill anchors perception, and suspended glass cases directly charge closure. "Salt-stiff collar" exemplifies sensory specificity shaping tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy vs. erasure) tightens when killer avoids ribbon like "it burned," narrowing options to connection over accusation. Cost is visible in his shaking shoulders as empathy crystallizes through shared action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through texture-as-truth motif; final faceless sketches offer resonant answer to "vanishing twice" without moralizing. "Preserved like sacred relics" reweights erasure into sacred remembrance through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("contours meant everything") filters all description; rhythm modulates with pressure ("Ragged. Close. Breath."). Killer’s dialogue carries subtext through implication ("They were beautiful") without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mist coiling like guilt made visible" achieves textural density without muddle. Final line’s "Faceless, too" delivers closure with crystalline propulsion, avoiding overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Face-blindness transforms detective trope into tactile truth-seeking; erasure-as-motif reframes cold cases through mask preservation. Killer’s "sacred relics" angle synthesizes brutality/beauty with emotional specificity.</comment>
