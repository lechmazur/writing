<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "devotion twisted into obligation," but Elara’s micro-choices lack layered irrationality under stress; "gasped, not from fear" oversimplifies emotional complexity during pivotal transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands powerfully with the ghost’s dissolution and orchard’s awakening; cost legible in "threads of her veil unraveling into motes of silver dust" amid tangible transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting constraining choice: glass panes "hummed" during awakening, and the bead’s resonance charges the final twilight fruit image, reweighting prior stasis through environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure as the bead’s resonance intensifies near Elara, but the ghost’s agency lacks visible tactical trade-offs during the transfer beat, slightly muting escalation under stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "haunting into heritage" and twilight fruit’s "sweet, bitter, and alive" nectar, avoiding moralizing; however, "the debt was never punishment; it was balance" edges toward explicit thematizing in peak tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ashen-veil ghost bride drifted" and rhythmic control during climax ("glass panes hummed. Stems straightened.") showcase pressure-modulated syntax without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "nectar the hue of forgotten vows" achieves high density with visceral specificity. Minor register drift in "resonant awakenings" (slightly clinical for POV) costs 0.1 in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes through alchemical botany specificity ("contract signed in mercury"), with "seventh daughter of seventh daughter" grounding emotional truth; risk-taking in closure’s sensory payoff avoids gimmickry.</comment>
