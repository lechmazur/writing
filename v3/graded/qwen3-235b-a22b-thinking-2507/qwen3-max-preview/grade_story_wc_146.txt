<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (metronomic heel strikes, silent footsteps post-work) and concrete contradiction (rebuilding without preventing collapse). "Infinitely patient" manifests in sustained action, not labels. Only minor lack of internal friction prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: fountain stop crystallizes rebalancing with visceral cost ("footfalls now silent"). Accumulative lens holds through escalating resonances (shutter creaks → ticking clock → rain). Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Cobblestones constrain every choice—third stone heel strike, spiral paths—charging the final image ("roofs sealed their leaks"). Micro-setting (tuning fork's memory-calibrated pitch) directly enables closure. Sensory hierarchy flawlessly reflects urgency (crisis narrows to stone vibrations).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("restore shared balance") tighten through protagonist agency: each step narrows options until fountain climax. Cost is undeniable—"footfalls now silent" shows sacrifice. Single deepening (cobblestones humming within themselves) suffices for accumulative lens. No passive convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "shared balance" shown via children of air/porches of resonance, not stated. Final image ("presence holding its breath") reweights "wild hush" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by defining rebalancing as "not resurrected... but rebalanced."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "boots whispering," "vibration like root seeking water" reflects tuner’s sonic focus. Rhythm modulates under pressure (compressed syntax at fountain climax). Minor repetition of "infinitely patient" prevents 9.5+, but serves as intentional motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dawn bled through fractured keystone" avoids cliché through fresh verbs. Every line advances texture ("laughter brushed past her ear though no child ran"). Figurative language ("vibration like root") serves accumulative pressure without muddle. Final line recharges opening rhythm flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghost town trope via sonic rebalancing—rebuilding through footsteps, not bricks. Specificity ("pitch calibrated to memory," "third cobblestone") prevents abstraction. Risk-taking (sound-based revival) heightens stakes coherently; fresh inflection in "echoes given form" feels inevitable.</comment>
