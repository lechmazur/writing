<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in stillness-as-alignment vs. generations' futile motion, but "weathered resolve" borders on label-speak; cost is embodied via the arrowhead's physical resonance at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: the skimmer's eternal vigilance forecloses journeying; "becoming the landmark" crystallizes the pulse's conceptual price without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Towers of bone function as micro-setting—rib-towers constrain navigation and charge the final image where "shadow kissed the third rib-tower," making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the flock's thermals: the pulse's arrival narrows options to stillness-as-direction, with cost legible when the skimmer "felt the pulse nestle into its chest cavity" beside the arrowhead.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"You do not chase the path. You become the landmark" avoids moralizing by emerging from concrete action; the final image reweights stillness as active alignment with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—every detail filtered through vibration/resonance ("marrow of its bones," "fossilized marrow sighs"); no head-hopping despite multi-POV elements in crows' flight patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "each groove a prayer, each facet a plea" risks thematic echo but is redeemed by immediate tactile anchoring to the arrowhead's worn smoothness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Transforms stillness trope through physics-poetry synthesis ("physics dressed in reverence"); the pulse concept feels inevitable via bird thermals, avoiding derivative spiritual clichés.</comment>
