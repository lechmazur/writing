<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied conflict ("gloved hands trembling") and micro-choices (ritual analysis) earn the closure's cost. Only minor abstraction in "remorse congealed thickest" slightly dilutes stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: "hollowed but whole" crystallizes cost via the pavilion's physical transformation. Accumulative lens holds through grief-layering escalation, with "liquid shadow" basin as decisive deepening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: rain-puddles' reflections guide descent, while coral pavilion's ice texture charges the final image ("dew... soil"). "Hoarfrost crunch" under boots makes environment tactilely essential to momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (transforming remorse) tightens through Elira's agency: her "sanding" action narrows options from avoidance to absorption. Cost ("skin burned with borrowed heartbreak") visibly alters tactics for cooking's new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "sanding" grief into "polished stones" avoids moralizing. Final image ("petrichor and possibility") reweights the premise non-literally, with "vessel, not cage" crystallizing earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile lexicon ("taste memories," "metallic tang of grief"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—shortened clauses during anguish absorption ("She did not flinch. She sanded.")—with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tidal wave of anguish" metaphor integrates cleanly with earlier "tide-stranded jellyfish." Final line's "rinsed and ready" achieves maximum density without muddle, propelling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: memory-tasting chef + coral remorse vault transforms grief tropes through sensory specificity ("soldier’s choked apology" dissolving in rain). Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
