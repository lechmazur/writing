<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes believably through micro-choices (hand-delivering envelopes, observing reactions), with embodied cost in "cautious exuberance" fearing joy might shatter. Secondary characters lack sufficient interiority depth despite strong initial reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "cautious exuberance—the kind that fears its own joy might shatter" crystallizes emotional vulnerability as harbor laughter embodies the compassion cycle. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (locket photos) charges the final image—"rhythm of compassion cycling onward"—while harbor tools (mop bucket, hemp coils) constrain delivery tactics. Specific sensory details like "salt-kissed air" avoid generic placeholder syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation deepens through Elias’s agency: initiating envelopes, witnessing ripple effects, and receiving expanded cycle. Cost is unmistakable in his emotional restraint, though secondary stake (profit vs. purpose) lacks sufficient friction during pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "gentler economy" actions, with final image reweighting "silent contributors" without moralizing. Slightly undercut by near-abstraction in "measured not in coin" phrasing during high-pressure delivery sequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("notices tides in teacups") and rhythmic control shine in "constellations blinked like distant signal lamps." Zero head-hopping; compression of time ("three nights later") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with propulsion ("He turned the locket over, tracing the initials"), but "wave after wave, tide after tide" borders on template cadence in final line despite thematic intent. No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms kindness trope through harbor-specific roles (foghorn tuner, ink mixer) with emotional truth in Rook pinning locket with a bent fork. Risk-taking in quiet closure avoids sentimentality but lacks one truly unexpected inflection for 9.0+.</comment>
