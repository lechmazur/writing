<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wistfully pragmatic hands" vs. poetic mission) manifests in prism placement under physical strain; final choice to "measure hope by millimeters" earns closure through prior causality (lockmaster's tooth revelation) with visible cost (aching knees, smudged palms).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "quivering hush" reconfigures from suspense to "reverence" with undeniable conceptual cost ("fragile act of defiance against encroaching gray"), sustained under Accumulative lens where prism placements deepen pressure without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fire escape grating and rusted railing function as micro-setting that constrains choice (prism angling against rust) and charges final image ("bent hook with fishing line"); harbor's "spilled mercury" reflections subtly mirror prism work but lack tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate accumulatively: "quivering hush" deepens from suspense to awe as each prism placement narrows options (only one remaining corner), with cost legible in "knees aching, palms smudged" and the temporary nature of "luminous, trembling moments."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through prism physics ("beauty found by angling light") not moralizing; final child-chasing-emerald image offers resonant answer to fragility vs. resilience without stating morals, avoiding thematic echo despite "fragile act of defiance" near-cliché.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is gardening-tactile ("fingers brushing last petal," "smudged with dirt"); rhythm modulates to oar-like cadence under pressure without head-hopping, with "crimson sigh" and "moonlit and merciful" showing lexical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crimson sigh" avoids purple prose by anchoring to action, and "measuring hope by millimeters" compresses insight without abstraction; final line’s "exhaled into dawn" recharges opening hush with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "gardener" trope through specific light-instilling mechanics; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes (prism placements as escalating pressure) without gimmickry, with "lockmaster’s tooth" offering fresh inflection on resilience.</comment>
