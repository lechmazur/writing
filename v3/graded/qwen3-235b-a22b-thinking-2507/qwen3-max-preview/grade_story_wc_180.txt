<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "didn't believe in redemption; she believed in repair" amid desperate hope. Embodied emotion peaks when throat tightens reaching for daughter's vow—no labels, pure sensory reaction to fresh rejection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: footprints and green scrap reconfigure stakes with visible cost (persistent loneliness vs. fragile hope). Lens holds—accumulative pressure crystallizes when vow adheres to honeyed spoon, reweighting "persist" with earned vulnerability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard isn't backdrop but active constraint: vow-trees dictate tactics (ivy ladder climb, honey coaxing), and wild rose thorns snag the green scrap—charging the final image with setting's persistent wildness. Micro-setting (ribbon, spoon) directly enables closure's emotional pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: finding daughter's fresh vow forces honey retrieval method, narrowing options to unsanctioned tools. Cost is visceral—throat tightening, stitching vow to ribbon—making "persist" a tangible trade-off of dignity for connection under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through mending mechanics, not moralizing. Final image—"honey, thread, and hope" packed with green scrap—reweights "accidental wisdom" as active tending, avoiding sentimentality while answering the central question through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: tools define noticing ("rusted magnifier," "bent spoon"), rhythm shifts from lyrical vows to staccato action during retrieval. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates stress via tactile compression ("She pulled, pinned, tucked—calloused hands sifting petals and promises").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—sentences vary rhythmically ("Leaves turned gold... not from autumn, but from lingering magic"). Highest-pressure beat (vow retrieval) uses precise verbs ("coated," "adhered," "softened") without figurative muddle. Final line’s "sticky spoon" crystallizes theme with concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "reconciliation trope" through mender’s trade-specific logic (vows as repairable objects). Emotional truth anchors universals: "stubborn as a root cracking pavement" feels lived-in, not quirky. Risk-taking (vow-trees as stakes) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
