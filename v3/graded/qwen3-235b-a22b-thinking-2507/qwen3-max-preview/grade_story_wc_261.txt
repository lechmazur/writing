<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (closure vs. continuation) embodied through micro-choices like examining coffee rings; weeping at the seed dissolution shows earned cost without diagnostic labels. Scar-as-text metaphor avoids abstraction while revealing hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the hourglass's spiraling sand reweights scars from tragedy to threshold with undeniable conceptual cost ("the lie she’d carried"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (ivy whispers → coffee rings → seed vision), no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower micro-setting constrains choices (ivy guides path, coffee rings hold memories); scar and hourglass charge the final image. "Moss-slick flagstones" and fossilized roots provide tactile specificity that alters tactics, though cathedral setting lacks equal texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: examining coffee rings narrows options to root-tangled tunnel, culminating in the seed dissolution's conceptual cost. Dominant stake (closure vs. continuation) tightens through accumulative pressure with her worldview shattered as visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: scars as readable texts and seeds as continuation avoid moralizing. Final hourglass image reweights the central question ("scars... like stories that refuse to end") with earned resonance, no thematic echo in the quiet, lyric ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: plants as emotional barometers ("vines curled like worried children"), scars as texts. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in terse lines ("She didn’t move it. She never did.") contrasting lyrical density, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; every line advances multiple elements ("concentric rings staining the oak table like tree rings telling forgotten years" compresses time/memory). Figurative language avoids muddle even in peak beats, though "silence pooled like spilled ink" slightly strains physical logic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy with plants as emotional conduit (not power trope), scars as readable texts. Coffee ring analysis grounds the "displaced miracle" trope in specific, verifiable detail. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
