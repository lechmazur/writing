<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in ledger reinventions versus stopped self-erasure; embodied cost in "ink drying in honest lines" forecloses reinvention path with visceral legibility. No diagnostic label-speak even during maternal melody climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "stopped reinventing herself" crystallizes stance via ledgers "staying open," reconfiguring paper trails' meaning. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens held through dust-mote mapping to attic's final breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Attic constrains every choice: cedar shelves enable meteorite discovery, skylight illuminates dust choreography that becomes her map. Final image charges closure as dust settles "like applause" on Reykjavik letter—environment directly reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: meteorite recalibration narrows options to harness redesign, paying visible price of abandoned reinventions. Pressure grows via density increase (dust patterns mirroring lullaby) under Accumulative lens until Argent's trill cracks her ribs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through attic's transformation: "reliquary of endings" blooming with "songs returning home" reweights preservation without moralizing. Final image of dust-as-applause offers resonant answer to loss/return question via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in pigeon-training lexicon ("measuring grain," "whispering coordinates into feathers"); rhythmic control peaks during Argent's trill with fragmented urgency. No head-hopping; compression taught early via ledger fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding: "cracked open Elara’s ribs like a music box" avoids cliché through precise avian context. Minor deduction for "bruised clouds" generic phrasing in high-pressure beat, but meteorite’s "miniature nebula" redeems density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer-pigeon-trainer preserving songs via Martian stone feels inevitable. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off through dust-mote choreography—avoids trope by rooting cosmic elements in tactile harness adjustments and ledger ink.</comment>
