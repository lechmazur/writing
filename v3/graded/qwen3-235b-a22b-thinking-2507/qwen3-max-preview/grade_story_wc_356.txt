<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's ambition for "serenity within motion" drives consistent micro-choices (e.g., journaling rituals), but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; her unwavering focus during the bloom's climax misses tension between fear and reverence that could elevate closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: the wilted husk and village transformation crystallize cost ("husk and lingering musk"), with the Accumulative/Textural lens holding through sensory density buildup to the bloom's decay. Final image reweights chaos as wisdom's source without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village actively constrains choices (solitary greenhouse work) and charges the final image ("Virelai swayed—not with fear, but with wildflower hush"), where setting evolution—from anxiety-laden rope bridges to softened children's steps—embodies thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the corpse flower's dormancy breaking at collective clarity, narrowing Elira's path to observation over intervention; cost is legible in the bloom's decay and village transformation, though the tide's "thought turning" lacks tangible pressure escalation before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sensory revelation ("grief is fertilizer, fear is root-depth"), but the final paragraph's explicit thesis—"stillness is not absence of motion"—triggers Thematic Echo penalty, nearly negating the earned resonance of the wildflower hush imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in olfactory-driven narration ("smell the anxiety in the air"), with rhythmic control intensifying during the bloom ("velvet scream"); minor register drift occurs in journaling descriptions ("translating fragrance into philosophy") that verges on abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in phrases like "petals unfurled in silent symphonies," though "wet iron and distant lightning—an olfactory omen" slightly overwrites the sensory cue in a high-pressure beat, risking clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms corpse flower trope through olfactory specificity and "serenity within motion" synthesis; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, but village transformation edges toward tidy resolution without lingering individual friction beyond collective change.</comment>
