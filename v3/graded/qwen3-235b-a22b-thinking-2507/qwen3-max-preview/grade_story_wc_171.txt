<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vivid in ritual preparation, but single-POV limits relationship crucible; closure endurance earned through smudged thumbprints revealing simultaneous hope and weariness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure crystallizes cost in 'imperfect mosaic'—peace as continuous muster, not victory; Accumulative lens holds through ritual density without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic terrace and ebony clipboard constrain choices (dais for writing, ink's iridescence preventing forgery) and charge the final image where triple moonlight illuminates smudged prints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elira's ritual agency: writing transforms hollow words into binding rhythm, with cost legible in the 'flawed beauty' of smudged consent that forecloses easy victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (schools where trenches ran), not abstraction; final image rejects 'pause' for 'pulse' without moralizing, reweighting redemption as courage to begin again.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp ('operatively gentle cadence', 'hollowed by years'); rhythmic control varies from lyrical openings to staccato declarations like 'She had not come to win.'</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in 'wheeled overhead during the slow dance' (-0.2), but closure lines ('imperfect mosaic of consent') achieve high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms war-trope through specific ritual mechanics (meteorite ink, triple-moon witness); emotional truth in 'flawed beauty' avoids generic hope, with risk-taking in quiet climax.</comment>
