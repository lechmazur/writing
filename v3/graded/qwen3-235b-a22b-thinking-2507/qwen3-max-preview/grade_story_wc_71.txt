<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority manifests through concrete micro-choices (pressing palm to root, thinking in textures) rather than labels; motivation crystallizes via embodied action when the cottage’s "ghostly fingers unclenched" with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: "not to preserve, but to honor" crystallizes the protagonist’s stance with felt cost (accepting normality as a tide), under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density reweights stakes through the dissolving shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The orris root shard functions as micro-setting—constraining the sanctification ritual and charging the final image ("molecules returning to root"); bay’s evolving lullaby mirrors internal shift from "hush" to "hushed blaze" without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory saturation ("gulls paused mid-cry," "shard glowed faintly") deepens the dominant stake (honoring memory) until the cottage’s release carries conceptual cost—no cheap resolution, only earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the root shard’s dissolution: "not to stop the creep, but to walk beside it" reframes memory as active honoring, avoiding moralizing via concrete final action (leaving the shard) that reweights prior "creeping normality" without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("silence pooled like spilled ink," "streetlights daydreamed"); rhythm modulates from lyrical calm to taut intensity during the ritual, with zero head-hopping despite multi-house consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every phrase propels ("placed the shard," "warmth bloomed in her chest"); metaphors ("hushed blaze," "molecules returning to root") are precise, character-rooted, and deepen closure without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "haunting" trope through the root shard’s materiality—memory isn’t supernatural but sensory scaffolding; "shard of hush" as tangible pressure point feels inevitable, resisting abstraction with bay/moss/salt specificity.</comment>
