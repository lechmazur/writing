<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation for incompleteness is embodied in micro-choices (weaving fragments, feather handling), but the boy’s characterization lacks internal conflict depth; his shift from hollow to curious feels earned yet underdeveloped beyond surface reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: the boy’s hollow stare at wreckage ("He doesn’t weep") crystallizes loss, while the patched kite’s flight reconfigures meaning under accumulative lens; orientation anchors by line 3 with lagoon/poet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lagoon constrains choices (tidepool perch, weaving by water) and charges closure ("lagoon breathing beside her"); feather’s warmth and seaglass scraps transform setting into active pressure point, avoiding postcard passivity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elira’s agency: grief’s "hardening" crystallizes into tangible rupture (ruined kite), narrowing options to reframing loss; cost is visible in the boy’s initial paralysis, but escalation lacks one additional deepening beat for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through woven dawns’ physical act—not moralizing—culminating in resonant final line ("snapped strings carry wind’s memory") that reweights loss without abstraction; avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in kite’s asymmetrical flight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading braille left by tide," "salt-cured silence") modulates rhythm under pressure; voice stays consistent through emotional peaks with zero head-hopping, taught compression ("crooked. glorious.") heightening tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "trembling with memory of storm" and "jubilant ghost" exemplify high-density imagery without muddle; minor overwriting risk in "bruised sky" offset by payoff in closure’s "burnished hush" cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief reframing via "woven dawns" avoids tropes; drake’s feather transforms generic mentor figure into mythic yet grounded logic, with bold risk in quiet closure where scars "dance" without resolution.</comment>
