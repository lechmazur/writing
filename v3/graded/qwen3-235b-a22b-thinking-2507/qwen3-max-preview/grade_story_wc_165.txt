<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's analytical yet fluid interiority drives micro-choices (balancing pebbles, bowing to soda cap) with embodied contradiction; secondary characters lack contradictory impulses beyond archetypal functions, weakening relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: final image of Elias/bishop/stars crystallizes "wonder hidden in plain sight" with conceptual cost (monotony transfigured); Accumulative lens holds through density accumulation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal arcade actively constrains choices (soda cap becomes drum, balloon woven into verse); driftwood bishop charges closure image but "faulty marquee lights" slightly dilutes specificity in pivotal starlight description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transfiguring monotony) tightens through audience transformations with visible cost ("Thank you for making tonight not just another shift"); escalation driven by Elias's agency under Accumulative lens, though physicist's shift lacks friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through spilled coffee constellations and lunar pebbles; final image reweights "wonder isn't rare" without moralizing, though "orchestrated serendipity" risks thematic echo if overemphasized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time stretched like saltwater taffy") modulates rhythm under pressure; "analytical street performer" label repeats but remains voice-coherent, avoiding diagnostic tics in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phosphorescence in midnight surf" achieves textural density without muddle; minor register drift in "serenade monotony" (slightly elevated for context) barely touches closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "calculated wilderness" through driftwood bishop/lunar pebbles; transforms street performer trope via specificity (conch shell harmonics, coffee constellations) without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
