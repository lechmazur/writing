<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bracken's contradictory impulses (grief vs purpose) act simultaneously when hearing his handler's voice, and his endurance as living archive earns Earned Stasis with visible cost in the handler's loss. Veyra remains functional rather than pressured, slightly thinning relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: "listening—not for death, but for the next voice" reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (transformed grief). Orientation clear by paragraph 2; lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through closure with density increase in decoded voices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wax leaf as micro-setting constrains choices (must hold to light for revelations) and charges the final image ("glow soft as breath"). Sensory details like "scent of aged shellac" reflect Bracken's urgency while scrapyard resources (circuit board stoves) enable wax preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure tightens meaningfully when the handler's voice reveals coordinates, narrowing options to the journey east. But bunker discovery lacks obstacles, softening escalation; cost remains conceptual (redefined closeness) rather than viscerally deepened beyond initial loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "truth wears many skins" shown via tinted revelations, not stated. Final image ("hands reaching across time") offers resonant non-literal answer to bridging loss without moralizing, with leaf's evolving glow embodying thematic shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bracken's perceptual signature ("scent of rain over rusted metal") and rhythmic control under pressure ("motivation struck him like a physical blow") are distinct. Zero head-hopping; dialogue filtered through sensory awareness ("It sings" carries subtext of yearning).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion: "magnifying glass trembling in his jaws" does triple duty. Minor deduction for "tinted revelations" repetition (3x), but refrains feel thematic rather than scaffold; final line ("listening—not for death...") has perfect cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: bloodhound-as-archivist and phonograph cylinders as emotional time capsules transform tropes through specific mechanics. Risk-taking (non-human POV) heightens stakes coherently; "resonance over salvage" premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
