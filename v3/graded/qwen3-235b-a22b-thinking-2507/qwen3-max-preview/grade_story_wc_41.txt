<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction underdeveloped; weeping at birthday song shows embodied emotion but lacks simultaneous competing impulses. Flawed memory trait informs actions yet blind spots aren't tested in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "He wouldn't remember this moment tomorrow" crystallizes the tidal inevitability. Accumulative lens holds through fog's sculpting and chalk's residue charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it guides driftwood placement and sculpts grief into tangible forms. The chalk's residue charging the closure image satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining memory tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual precision of driftwood triangulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency beyond repetition. Cost ("decay felt like his own") is visceral yet the pressure buildup feels atmospheric rather than decision-driven under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through tidal metaphor reweighting aging as "relentless, rhythmic" longing. Final image of humming chalk offers non-literal answer to "sound of time thickening" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "scent of ozone," "taste of static" filter reality through synesthetic precognition. Rhythmic control under pressure ("chalk shrieked, and for three heartbeats") avoids head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "rustled fender half-buried in moss" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-deduction for "trembled in his grip" cliché, but redeemed by immediate tuning-fork metaphor that advances atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sonic aging with junkyard mysticism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in making time's sound "tidal" heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming a familiar metaphor through concrete stakes.</comment>
