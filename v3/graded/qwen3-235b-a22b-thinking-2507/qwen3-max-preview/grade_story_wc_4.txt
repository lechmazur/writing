<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archivist’s embodied motivation shines through tactile micro-choices (tracing kite’s tail, studying millimeters of distance) without therapy-speak; contradiction between stillness and transformative action ("transmute pain") fuels her credible endurance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "leaving no footprints... echo of mended moments" crystallizes stakes with visible cost ("knees protesting, heart full"); Accumulative lens holds through photo sequence, orientation anchored by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Dove gray case constrains every choice (kneeling to open it, sunbeam on closure); lavender field’s scent and dew directly charge her physicality ("fingers brushing dew") and final image—environment shapes tactics and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through photo sequence (kite→bench→bicycle), each narrowing emotional options; cost manifests in bodily toll ("knees protesting") and the bicycle photo’s "stubborn hope" reweighting grief under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (puddle reflection of mural), never stated; final image ("sunbeam gild the dove gray case") reweights decay/beauty without moralizing—Earned Stasis answers "how to mend the world" through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("bees hummed hymns to resilience," "trembling frequency"); voice modulates perfectly under pressure (lyrical in photos, clipped with passersby); zero head-hopping despite thematic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or artifacts; "cradling a shattered bicycle, his face hidden, his posture a question mark carved in grief" achieves multi-jobbing without overwriting; final line’s rhythm ("archived, curated, and ultimately, set free") charges closure flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work as healing alchemy; "arcs" motif (kites, spines, vines) feels inevitable through specific images; avoids cliché by grounding universals in lavender’s scent and iron-rich soil.</comment>
