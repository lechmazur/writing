<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete: "hollow with grief and guilt" anchored by missed recitals, with contradictory impulses (deserving failure vs. persistent tinkering) culminating in earned self-forgiveness through the heart's beat. No diagnostic labels; embodiment via trembling hands and "quiet agony of precision" elevates beyond sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with visceral cost: the heart's beat mirrors grace after years of guilt, with the storm-light revelation reconfiguring options. Minor deduction as light solution edges toward coincidence, though mitigated by Mrs. Lin's "waiting for a different hand" foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Shop functions as active micro-setting: light through bay window directly enables climax by revealing the heart's shadow, while lemon oil/tarnished brass sensories filter through Elias's repair focus. Meets 9+ gate—environment constrains choice and charges the final image ("music curling like incense").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: rejected cogs and escapement failures narrow options until the light-triggered realization forces realignment. Cost legible in "years preaching forgiveness yet never granted it to himself," though storm-light deus ex machina slightly dilutes escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "It gave me mine" reweights forgiveness without moralizing, while the heart's beat as "mirror" delivers resonant non-literal answer. Final image ("rhythm of grace") crystallizes earned complexity—no thematic echo, just incisive subtext in Mrs. Lin's second-opinion wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "brass gears exposed, ivory keys unstrung" reflects chaplain-tinkerer duality, with syntax modulating from precise (repair steps) to lyrical (music "curling like incense"). Zero head-hopping; rhythm under pressure ("hands trembling, he realigned") meets 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances story: "porcelain faces as if absolving them" fuses character and setting. Minor deduction for "hollow with grief" bordering cliché, but redeemed by concrete context. Closure beat ("heart beating, steady as a vow") achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope via clockwork specificity: heart syncing to "Clair de Lune" creates fresh emotional calculus. Risk-taking (mechanical precision as spiritual metaphor) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "penitentiary chaplain" archetype slightly limits novelty at 9+ band.</comment>
