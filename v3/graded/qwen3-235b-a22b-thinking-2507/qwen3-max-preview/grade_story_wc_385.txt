<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (trembling not from fear but weight of question) and micro-choices (surrendering voice for days). Final renunciation (singing to entity instead of destroying) earned through prior causality, though flaw integration slightly softens cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as entity shrinks to "a sigh," with visible cost (raw throat, lighter soul) and conceptual cost (echoes as stolen resonance returned). Accumulative lens holds: density builds through shell revelations toward resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus constrains choice (vessel for echoes) and charges final image (entity resting in petrified willow roots). Micro-setting (seashell) evolves from diagnostic tool to silent artifact, charging closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unraveling echo theft) tightens through protagonist's progressive disclosure, narrowing options to singing as solution. Cost legible in raw throat and emotional shift, though escalation lacks one felt price altering mid-scene tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: echoes as "residues" reweighted in final lullaby. Ending offers non-literal answer (singing returns resonance) without moralizing, embracing complexity of grief-as-fuel with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vibrating in their marrow," "reed-blown melancholy") with rhythmic control during singing sequence. Voice modulates from trembling inquiry to raw lullaby without head-hopping, taught early and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("syllables overlapping like ghosts trying to speak in unison"). Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstraction, but closure lines ("shell now silent") avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms echo trope through specific desert mythology and emotional calculus (grief sings loudest here). Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "resonance returned" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
