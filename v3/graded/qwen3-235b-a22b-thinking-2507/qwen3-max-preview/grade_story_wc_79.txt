<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her "hollow ache" versus electric certainty; micro-choices like etching names in the whistle reveal values with visible cost. Only minor flaw: physical struggle climbing ridge implied but not embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost—"sunwashed dread would finally have a voice"—under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 3; pressure intensifies through pattern-language experiments without telegraphing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Turtle-shell ridges function as micro-setting that constrains her climax choice; reed whistle charges the final image as "second heart." Sensory details ("sun bleached the sky white") filter through cartographer’s map-focused perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cracking silence) tightens through her seventeen-season pattern refinement, culminating in the dawn test. Agency drives escalation; cost is visceral in "become part of the lost expedition’s legend" with no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from pattern-language mechanics, not abstraction; final image ("watchers... choose whether to remain silent—or confess") reweights prior material as resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in cartographer’s map-centric noticing ("groove a street, ridge a district"); rhythm shifts from flowing to staccato during the whistle test. Zero filter verbs or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frantic spirals, not ink" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor deduction: "electric certainty" slightly jars lexicon but doesn’t obscure closure. Read-aloud cadence mirrors tension build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pattern-language communication transforms the "silent watchers" trope through specific cartographic logic; turtle-shell setting avoids generic post-apocalypse via micro-choices (e.g., charcoal sticks for mapping skin). Near-flawless synthesis.</comment>
