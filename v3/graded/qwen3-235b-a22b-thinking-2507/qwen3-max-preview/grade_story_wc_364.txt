<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "traced glyphs not to decode but to remember the shape of meaning" embodies contradictory impulses. Final choice earned through silk’s depletion, with cost legible in its "gratitude" glow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: glyph holding permanently crystallizes magic’s return with visceral cost in silk’s final glow. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through glyph density shifts toward undeniable reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mine shafts function as micro-setting that constrains choice (glyph-tracing under time pressure) and charges closure: "arches hummed now, too" reweights prior rubble into rhythm. Tools (silk-woven hinges) directly alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through silk’s thinning—a visible price narrowing Arlo’s options until the final glyph hold. Agency drives deepening: "willingly given, thread by thread" forecloses preservation, with cost made legible in its gratitude glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silk’s evolution: "meekness was not weakness" crystallizes into "he had become the barter." Final image reweights resilience as collective magic, avoiding moralizing despite thematic proximity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "hammering not metal but memory" reflects Arlo’s trade. Rhythmic control under pressure—"glyphs made sense for three heartbeats"—avoids ventriloquism; elision (villagers’ off-page strength) taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid twilight" and "scrape of boot on stone" compress texture without muddle. Final line’s "magic returned, woven into soil, steel, and spirit" propels closure with crystalline density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "meek hero" trope through specific mechanics: magic shared via plowshares, not spells. "Bartered awakenings" reconfigured as community resilience—synthesis feels inevitable when silk’s depletion enables the glyph’s permanence.</comment>
