<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") shown via reassembling shredded letters, but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choice of planting the diamond reveals value hierarchy without internal conflict. Sorrow for buried truths provides felt cost but no genuine struggle with the safety of lies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Immediate orientation ("wasteland orchard, boots crunching") anchors by word 10. Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: diamond pulsing in her palm crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("sorrow for every orchard buried under lies"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density builds to the plaque discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard actively constrains choices (dust storms repelled within ten-foot radius), with the diamond charging the final image ("beat like a second heart"). Irradiated soil/peach blossoms and humming roots aren't backdrop but pressure points that alter tactics during the planting beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through knowledge deepening (shredded letters revealing Project Stillpoint), narrowing options to truth-seeking. The cost is visceral: trembling shifts from "thrill of near-discovery" to sorrow when realizing the cover-up. Dominant stake (truth vs. control) crystallizes without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image "Truth didn’t hide. It rooted" reframes the premise without moralizing, emerging from concrete actions (reassembling letters, planting diamond). Avoids thematic echo; "comfortable lies" stakes gain weight through the orchard’s humming roots and her physical reassembly work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("each petal’s tremor... whispering data") reflects her debunker mindset. Rhythm modulates from lyrical observation ("bees humming hymns older than radiation") to clipped action ("She knelt. Pressed the diamond") under pressure. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style maintains focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "roots humming the frequency only the sharply observant could hear" does triple duty (character, setting, theme). Minor register drift in "tasted like safety" (conceptual vs. sensory) slightly dulls peak beat, but final line’s propulsion ("stepped beyond the orchard’s edge") recharges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via regenerative tech ("tuning fork" diamond) and quiet resistance. Risk-taking in climax (no confrontation, just tracing coordinates) heightens stakes through accumulated weight. "Flawed, yes, but alive" reconfiguration feels inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
