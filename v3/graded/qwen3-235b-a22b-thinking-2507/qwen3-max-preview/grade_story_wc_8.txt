<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "emotionally rational" trait—weeping at symphonies yet rejecting sentimentality during discovery—but micro-choices under pressure lack visceral physical cost during the letter's unearthing, slightly flattening the climax's stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the rose petal’s "crimson surrender" crystallizes the conceptual cost of draining pretense, with the historian’s resolve foreclosing easy triumph. Orientation anchors instantly; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the final "shed its curated silence" exhale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-strangled beams and oilcloth-wrapped letter function as micro-setting, constraining her movements and charging the finale—the petal falling into the puddle reweights the station’s "curated silence" as active complicity. Only minor deduction for concrete not actively impeding her search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through her publication strategy shift—from "scream accusations" to "invitation"—with visible cost in the surrender of easy catharsis. Pressure tightens via her mentor’s lantern metaphor, but the physical discovery lacks tangible opposition beyond atmospheric decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "noble lies are the mortar of memory" crystallizes into the rose petal’s "crimson surrender," reweighting the lie’s cost without moralizing. Final image answers the central question—truth as active drainage, not passive revelation—with devastating precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in historian’s selective attention (moss-brushed fingers, candle-smoke vellum), but minor register drift occurs in "calcified into national myth"—elevated diction clashing with her pragmatic voice during high-stakes discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "roots cracking like veins of forgotten time" exemplifies textural density. Deduct 0.3 for "calcified into national myth" in peak beat—a near-cliché muddling otherwise crystalline rhythm during the letter’s reveal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of historian-as-detective with emotional precision avoids academic tropes. The "lantern in a hurricane" metaphor transforms genre conventions, but the railway station setting edges toward familiar decay symbolism without full reinvention.</comment>
