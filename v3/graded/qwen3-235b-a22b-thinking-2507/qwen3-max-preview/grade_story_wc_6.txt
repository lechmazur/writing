<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (destruction/salvation fire) act simultaneously in scene; final choice to thread coin and return daily earns closure with felt cost of legacy integration. No therapy-speak, only embodied choices like "sand falling from her knees" grounding her moral calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: coin submerged beneath lagoon's surface crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost ("scar and song entwined"). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup, with cloud migration pause mid-hum proving orientation taught early and functional at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand function as micro-setting constraining choice (kneeling, threading coin) while charging final image ("coin-glint winking beneath surface"). Volcanic specificity shapes tactics: sand's "gritty and grounding" texture enables her emotional anchoring during the graft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: lowering coin to "kiss surface" narrows options from observation to active grafting, with cost legible in irreversible submersion ("coin now resting beneath surface, still pulsing"). Dominant stake (legacy redemption) tightens through her micro-choices under textural pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"thread the red cord around its obsidian wrist"—not abstraction. Final image reweights "scars can sing" as harmonic coexistence ("not to erase the burn, but to harmonize with it") without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo via earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("grace of tide-pulled kelp," "whale-song trapped in glass") with rhythmic compression under stress ("taps the mic twice: 'En route'"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical calm to tactical brevity while maintaining consistent focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "volcanic and cool, harvested from the forbidden beach" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("kelp-drift peace") avoids muddle in peak beats, with final line's triadic rhythm ("with grace, with alertness...") charging closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter/arsonist trope through specific volcanic setting and "graft" metaphor synthesized from prior particulars. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes ("shards shaped like wings, like lungs") while maintaining conceptual integrity through scar/song motif.</comment>
