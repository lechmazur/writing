<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in smudging "afraid" into "alive," but "cryptic" trait remains slightly abstract; embodied cost of memory loss grounds the apology quest without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: dissolving letters and new droplets reconfigure stakes with visceral cost ("salt and forgiveness"), while Accumulative lens holds through condensation’s evolving messages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mangroves actively constrain choices (roots tripping her, leaf-windows carrying messages), with the shard’s warmth charging the final image; micro-setting passes 9+ gate by shaping every pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through leaf-window messages shifting from accusation to hope, but cost legibility wavers until the final droplets; escalation lacks one tangible consequence before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dissolving letters → new droplets without moralizing; "salt and forgiveness" offers resonant non-literal answer to "apology space" question, avoiding thematic echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wax cracked like frozen regret") shines, but "fierce tenderness" repetition slightly undermines rhythmic control during pivotal healing moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tasted of salt and forgiveness" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor cadence repetition in "She didn’t... She didn’t..." before climax blocks 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "unsent letters" trope via mangrove mechanics; shard as "seed of stone" feels organic. Freshness anchored in specific emotional calculus, though "cryptic medium" archetype limits risk distinction.</comment>
