<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action: "cradling the melted snow globe against her chest" reveals motivation without labels. Contradictory impulses (salvaging echoes vs. releasing them) crystallize in the shrine ritual with visible cost: the child's release requires relinquishing the object. No therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "sigh echoes... not wind, not voice, but release."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise: setting the globe in the ice window reconfigures meaning as "miniature streets reform," with cost legible in the "sigh... release." Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dream cameos accumulate into a constellation—but minimal escalation within the single scene limits pressure tightening. Orientation clear by word 20 ("candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacier ice actively constrains choice: the "shallow recess shaped like a window frame" enables the closure action, while "glacial chill" contrasts the globe's warmth. Sensory details ("blue-veined ice," "breath curling like incense") filter through the diver's ritual focus, charging the final image where ice "ripples, not melting, but remembering." Micro-setting drives the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering the child's message) signaled early via "windows of connection," but pressure lacks visible escalation within the shrine scene. Deepening occurs through dream analysis, yet the cost—"release"—remains abstract until the final beat. Agency is clear (placing the globe in the frame), but the single-scene design limits tactical narrowing; cost legibility arrives late ("sigh echoes... release").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "truth, when mishandled, shatters" evolves into "truth... can mend" via the globe's transformation. Final image ("window within a window, refracting borrowed starlight") resonates non-literally with the child's message, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo—insights arise from concrete actions like mapping "dream cameos like constellations." Subtext in "windows not doors" reweights connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: diver notices "crystalline relief" and "trapped candle-flame," reflecting her profession. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("She sees the child’s final moments—not terror, but wonder"). Free indirect style clean ("as she thinks of it"). Minor deduction for "weaves truth carefully" repetition diluting voice confidence in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "snowflakes swirl in suspended animation" does triple duty (image, rhythm, closure charge). Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "miniature streets reform." Verbatim repetition of "weaves truth carefully" (para 3 and 20) triggers -0.1 for paraphrase loop. No figurative muddle—metaphors ("breath curling like incense") serve immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost whisperer" trope through specific mechanics: dream cameos as narrative evidence, melted snow globe as memory conduit. Emotional truth in "warmth turning to water" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes—the mosaic of strangers' dreams crystallizes meaning without gimmickry. "Windows not doors" insight feels inevitable.</comment>
