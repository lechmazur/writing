<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("reverence," "sacred") without embodied contradiction; micro-choices lack visible hierarchy of values. "Lucidly watchful" trait is label-heavy without tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as flawless Charged Poise: the drifting chip crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("when her own time came"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from "hiss between radio frequencies" to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto actively constrains choices (condensed skylight as medium) and charges closure, but "silk spun from cloud-moths" edges toward ornamental. Environment shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s pattern-weaving agency ("threading silence through silence"), with cost legible in her future return. Escalation reweights oblivion’s inevitability via the chip’s captured spark.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the chip’s transformation from "vessel" to "tiny lantern" reweights mortality without moralizing. Final image ("quiet yes") offers resonant answer to "threshold" concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("oil distilled from frozen moonpetals") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" territory prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through dense imagery. "Powdered starlight" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat, but closure image ("sail forever under aurora’s gaze") achieves crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms death rituals through specific physics ("slow photons") and "threshold of stillness" concept. Risk-taking with Accumulative lens heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
