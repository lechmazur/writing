<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (trailing fingers like braille, rejecting "polite chuckle" for "bubbling" laugh), but the epiphany about buried joy lacks sufficient struggle prior to the climax to fully earn the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly—"pocketed the fragment, no longer a relic, but a key" crystallizes renunciation of preservation with felt cost, though the compressed elder visits slightly weaken causal escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fog functions as active emulsion enabling the climax; "fog curled around her ankles like a contented cat" charges the final image while constraining her light-painting method throughout, meeting 9+ gate requirements decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from "display" to "resurrecting spirit," with the projection scene narrowing options through protagonist agency, but the single tightening lacks a visible tactical cost during the climax beat itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("warmth bloomed under her palm," "apples that would never rot"), avoiding moralizing while the final image answers the central question of rediscovery versus preservation with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("painting with light," "fog-thread tapestries") maintains rhythmic control under pressure; the "contented cat" simile exemplifies character-specific observation without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("sun pierced the fog like a blade through gauze" accelerates action), though "impossible color" slightly overwrites "shimmered" in one high-pressure beat, risking figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the "artist's epiphany" trope through concrete mechanics (fog as emulsion, ancestral knowledge network), with the orchard setting resisting generality via tactile details like "moss-caked stone walls" and "honeyed cider" pigments.</comment>
