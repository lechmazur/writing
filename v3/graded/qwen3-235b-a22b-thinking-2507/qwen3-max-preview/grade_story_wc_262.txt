<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines with embodied contradictions ("origami birds" vs. "dust in cedar box"), but projectionist remains off-page construct; micro-choices like "knees stiff" rise stakes, though spatial trait lacks sufficient cost demonstration during discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "rescued birds" release and "lanterns on river" reconfiguration, but marquee glitch risks convenience; cost legible via "stitch itself into ribs" physicality yet lens (Accumulative/Textural) slightly frayed by convenient compartment discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projection booth micro-setting actively constrains action (hidden compartment under baseplate), with oilcloth bundle directly altering tactics; "cedar box" to "rescued birds" object evolution charges final image, though "wet stone" scent feels generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused love's weight) tightens through letter discovery, with "stitch into ribs" embodying cost; escalation driven by gazer's agency in reading/releasing, but compartment discovery leans slightly fortuitous rather than fully earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "origami birds" to "lanterns on river" progression; avoids moralizing with "LOVE NEVER ENDS" glitch preserving ambiguity, while final line reweights premise through motion rather than silence without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("map emotions like constellations") controls rhythm under pressure; "hushed thunder" motif evolves naturally, though "ghost of piano keys" risks borderline purple prose without sufficient character-specific filtering in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold with exceptional propulsion; "ink still wet with apology" exemplifies multi-jobbing lines. Minor density risk in "humming with energy of a thousand suppressed confessions" avoids muddle through concrete "sprocket holes" anchoring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "found letters" trope via film-strip psychometry; "unused love incubates" concept feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though projectionist backstory slightly echoes epistolary conventions.</comment>
