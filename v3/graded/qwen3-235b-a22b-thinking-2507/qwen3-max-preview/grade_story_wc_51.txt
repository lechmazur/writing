<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied action ("she merely nodded, extinguishing the lamp") and contradictory impulses (trapped yet purposeful), but the weaver's specific history with the locket lacks causal groundwork for full 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost ("Not to be free. But to endure"), the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through calcification pattern, and persistent constraint (the grotto's purpose) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bronze grotto constrains every choice (lamp alignment, shelf placement) and charges the final image ("stalactites... metronome marking time"), with starlight refracting through oxidized walls becoming a recurring object that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the man's burden forcing the weaver's self-confrontation, narrowing options to endurance; cost is visible in her calcified locket, though the shift from visitor to self feels slightly abrupt for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (calcifying letters into "seashell whorls"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights grief as "fossils of feeling" without stating a moral, though "boundary-lessly trapped" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper halos that danced like drowned fireflies") and rhythmic control under pressure, with consistent focalization; lyric compression taught early ("Calcify was the word...") pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "shingled hush" deepens stakes without muddle, though "whalebone reverie" borders on ornamental in one instance; final image ("stone smoothed by tides") achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief-calcification trope through specific, tactile mechanics (lamp alignment, tessellating lattices); "bronze grotto" setting resists generic fantasy with oxidized physics and snowmelt time pressure.</comment>
