<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("withdrawn" yet driven by vow to liminality) and embodied emotion ("joints unsnapped...liberated") are strong, but motivation lacks concrete friction; "capture possibility" remains abstract despite visceral execution. Final laugh earns change but prior micro-choices under pressure feel sparse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with threads as conduits and conceptual cost of transformation, but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful resistance—the greenhouse enables rather than pressures the knight, missing one tightening beat that narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: mercury roots dictate nectar flow, phosphor-bark ignites in response to motion. Final "soil that sings" charges the image while the copper troughs and glass panes evolve causally with the ritual, perfectly meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("capture possibility") is signaled early but faces no opposition—reality shifts accommodate rather than challenge the knight. Escalation lacks trade-offs; the single deepening (unsnap sequence) reweights meaning but omits visible cost until closure, weakening pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes non-literally through "dawn of new grammar" reweighting the liminal vow, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("threads remain...horizon reshapes") offers resonant answer to "threshold" allegiance without stating moral, though "shivering bliss" slightly abstracts the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV-perfect perceptual signature ("armor dulled by years of silence and moss" filters alchemy through knight’s decay). Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("frost and flame entwined"), with no head-hopping; "factually mystical" diction fits his alchemical lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sound like thawing ice over deep water" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor deduction for "shivering bliss" repetition in high-pressure beats, risking slight redundancy without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms knight trope through "unsnap" vulnerability and allegiance to liminality. Risk distinction bonus for structural boldness (ritual as climax), but "murmured allegiance" borders on familiar phrasing without sufficient fresh inflection in early beats.</comment>
