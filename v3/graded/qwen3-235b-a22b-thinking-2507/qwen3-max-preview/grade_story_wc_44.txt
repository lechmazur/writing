<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses despite strong embodied motivation; "quietly deliberate" trait constrains action but internal conflict remains intellectual rather than emotional. Final choice as threshold-keeper earns cost through visible vigilance ("key warm in her pocket").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "noon cast a shadow on time itself" crystallizes conceptual cost of eternal vigilance. Accumulative lens holds through ritual repetitions; 17th-night threshold step provides decisive deepening without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (orrery/key) constrains choices: brass serpent key enables threshold-crossing, and nocturnal observatory directly charges final image where she "kept watch... as the floating isle drifted." Environment shapes tactics via cracked dome and skeletal orrery mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: nightly rituals narrow options from observation to embodiment. Cost unmistakable in closure—her eternal duty ("key warm in her pocket") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual price paid on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image "noon cast a shadow on time itself" delivers resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from "sealed awakenings" concept, avoiding abstraction through concrete shadow-murmurs and ΘΑΛΗΣ-9 rune inscription.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "tracing the absence left behind," "vibrating up her spine like a struck tuning fork." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—clinical short sentences during key-winding shift to lyrical flow at threshold crossing. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; each sentence propels narrative: "Gears spun backward. Runes... flared cobalt, then gold, then black." Final line crystallizes concept without muddle—"noon cast a shadow—not on the ground, but on time itself." Peak beats use sparse, precise imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "bent reality" trope through literal shadow quest and "sealed awakenings" synthesis. Emotional specificity in scholar's quiet persistence avoids abstraction; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
