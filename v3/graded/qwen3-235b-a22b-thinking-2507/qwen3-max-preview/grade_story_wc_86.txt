<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete objects (drawer pull grooves as "raw material"); micro-choices like refusing to open the list reveal hierarchy of values; prosecutor's motivation ("memorized names") shows earned vulnerability but lacks secondary pressure depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (exchanged relics symbolizing "swapping ghosts"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase (mist, wind, relics); cost legible in "cold and heavy" key transfer and shared descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parapet functions as micro-setting: "wind doesn't take sides" constrains tactics, while drawer pull/key evolution charges final image; mist shifts from obscuring ("swallow the horizon") to fertile ("hides nothing if willing to see") with causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single tightening ("Did you bring the names you buried?") forces prosecutor's vulnerable admission; dominant stake (truth vs. political expediency) narrows options to relic exchange; cost felt in "etched with grief" eyes and exchanged cold relics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "recycle mistakes into wisdom" embodied in relic exchange; final image ("pulse of wisdom recycled from wreckage") reweights loss without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by showing rather than stating reconciliation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: negotiator notices "tremor beneath bravado," prosecutor "weary" voice; rhythmic control in short sentences during confrontation; no head-hopping despite dual POV within Track C parameters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "furrowed hush" evolves meaningfully across beats; high density ("mist curled like smoke around her boots" does triple duty); minor deduction for "synchronized breaths with moon phases" near-purple prose mitigated by "metaphorically" qualifier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms prisoner exchange trope through "swapping ghosts" premise; specificity of drawer pull/key as emotional conduits feels inevitable; risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural lens heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
