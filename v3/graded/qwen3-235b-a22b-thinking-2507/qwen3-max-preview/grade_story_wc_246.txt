<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") embodied through micro-choices like dissolving commas; final renunciation of fixed meaning earned by glyph-tracing sequence with conceptual cost in "carrying better questions."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("history as wet clay") under Accumulative lens; orientation anchored by "warped crust of spacetime" at 47 words; lens holds through "contingent relationships" escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly actively pressures choices ("ground rippled like water under parchment"); pen-as-tool constrains editing method and charges final image with "starlight ink," meeting 9+ gate via tangible constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "meaningful deepening" as edits progress from trees to wars; conceptual cost of embracing fluidity made visceral via "wet clay" metaphor, with agency driving each contingent revision under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (scream→sigh, funerals→train stations); final "dancing with time's grammar" reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through character-specific insight ("wrong tense").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("light bent in lazy spirals") and rhythmic control under pressure ("let the commas dissolve") create distinct voice; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "thresher ran on broken gears" conveys theme/action); figurative language in peak beats ("causality hiccup") enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms time-edit tropes via "contingent relationships" mechanics; emotional truth in war→diplomatic dinners avoids cliché; risk-taking (lyric sci-fi) heightens stakes while maintaining conceptual integrity.</comment>
