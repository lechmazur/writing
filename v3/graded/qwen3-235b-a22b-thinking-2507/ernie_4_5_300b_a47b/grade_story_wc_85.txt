<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("helping people lie" vs. "this was different") powers the pivotal choice; embodied guilt via trembling watch and barnacle metaphor avoids label-speak; micro-choices (selecting driftwood pieces) reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through driftwood visions, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "truth too heavy to carry alone" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (watch's coldness); orientation clear by 50 words; cost legible in "noose around his neck" and final "drowning in the sound".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Driftwood functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Elias must interpret carvings) and charges closure ("ocean had kept the truth"); sensory specificity ("cedar etched *Silence*") mirrors internal state without cliché; cobalt terrace’s fading color tracks emotional shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: discovering brother’s erasure via driftwood deepens the "sieved hush" from absence to active consumption; single escalation (carvings revealing truth) forecloses false-memory solution with visible cost (guilt "twisted, sharp and familiar"); pressure coherent under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sieved hush" transforms from abstract silence to "space left behind when truth was swallowed by tide"; final image ("drowning in the sound") reweights truth’s burden without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of salt and secrets") with rhythmic control; pressure modulates syntax (short phrases during visions); no head-hopping; "barnacles of conscience" exemplifies character-particular metaphor; tension in Lila’s withheld brother name carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("watch hand vibrated, as if reacting to wood’s energy"); minor scaffold in "He’d spent years..." reflection (18% of text) but anchors present via pocket-watch micro-choice; no loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-manipulation trope via driftwood’s physical archive; "sieved hush" as non-obvious emotional metaphor; risk-taking (textural escalation over causal turns) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("*Father* and *Son*" carving) avoids abstraction.</comment>
