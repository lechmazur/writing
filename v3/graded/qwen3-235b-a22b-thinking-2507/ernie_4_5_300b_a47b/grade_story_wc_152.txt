<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "disguising wisdom as foolishness" and stitch/pattern metaphors, but Jaxon’s underdevelopment limits relationship crucible; embodied emotion lacks physical specificity during high-pressure moments like the coup revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the unraveling chart and "echoed silence of revelation," but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) persists past midpoint; cost of hidden truths is felt yet not fully tethered to the coup’s immediate stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt silk and candle flame constrain choices (threading under flame’s glow) and charge the final image; autumn winds pressure the scene through rattling windows, though observatory’s spatial choreography lacks tactile navigation details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. council control) tightens via the star’s movement, but coup pressure remains abstract backdrop rather than visceral, on-page test; Jaxon’s telescope warning lacks escalation cost beyond intellectual tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s non-linearity resonates through the unraveling galaxy chart without moralizing, though "adjacent possibilities" remains conceptually vague; final image reweights the premise but secondary stake (coup survival) feels under-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "needles darted like comets" and sensory embroidery focus; rhythm modulates beautifully under pressure, though Zara’s internal voice occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction during crisis beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and high density ("stitch out of place, and the whole pattern unravels"), but "wind chimes" simile feels clichéd and "constellations of dust" borders on overwriting in high-tension beats; final line’s cadence elevates closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Galaxy-chart embroiderer transforms "craft as resistance" trope through cobalt silk and cosmic synchronicity; bold fusion of astronomy and textile art feels inevitable, though coup framework leans slightly on political thriller conventions without full transformation.</comment>
