<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear of past failure vs. hope) drives her chant intensification and "filter" action; embodied emotion in "breath hitched" and raw laugh avoids therapy-speak. Final choice to "become fire" earns renunciation of hopelessness through prior causality (mentor's lessons).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "shadows weren't darkness, but unlit potential" reweights her failure into resilience. Non-closure Accumulation Cap applied (-0.8) for coincidental note discovery lacking prior setup, weakening escalation under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fire-lilies function as micro-setting that constrains choice (requires "filtering" to bloom) and charges final image (reflected light defying starless void). Misses 9+ gate as environment only pressures tactics during climax, not earlier navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (defying hopelessness) tighten through Lira's agency: chanting guides her, ambient awareness narrows options, "filter" triggers bloom. Non-closure Accumulation Cap (-0.8) for mentor's guidance feeling convenient (knot flare as deus ex machina), slightly undermining pressure legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: lilies blooming reweights "shadows" as potential without moralizing. Final image ("becoming fire") offers resonant answer to "how to defy gravity" by reframing failure as resilience, avoiding sentimentality or binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (fire-focused senses, rhythmic chants) modulates under pressure—"guttural sound" deepening as tension rises. Minor register drift in "hopelessness is a gravity" slightly jars mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density crystallizes action/emotion/theme: "knot’s flame had spread... bloomed violently." Final line’s rhythm ("defy gravity—not by escaping it, but by becoming fire") recharges motif with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through firework-specific logic (kerosene knot, ambient awareness). "Shadows bloom" redefinition feels earned from prior particulars, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
