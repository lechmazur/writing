<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "truthful lies" moment shows self-deception, but epiphany lacks layered embodied cost; "sickening lurch" hints at physicality yet remains intellectualized without deeper struggle against her yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the shattered frost reweights the arbor’s nature with felt cost ("assumptions shattered"), but the Accumulative lens slightly obscures causal urgency in the realization beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and car window frost actively constrain choices—Mara’s method relies on reading emotions through ice patterns, and the final shattering directly alters her tactics, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (validation vs truth) tighten through sensory accumulation until the frost shatters, narrowing options, but Mara’s passive observation weakens agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (prism distortion, arbor’s silence), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "truthful lies" without stating morals, though near-miss with diagnostic phrasing in climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen lightning," storm-cloud eyes) modulates under pressure, but "truthful lies" phrasing disrupts voice consistency with unearned abstraction during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm shifts ("frost shattered... light flared"), yet "truthful lies" triggers diagnostic label penalty; minor scaffold in "tracing... tracing" slightly dulls closure’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological mysticism avoids tropes through specific emotional mirroring mechanics; risk-taking in quiet disillusionment elevates stakes, though mystic archetype lacks full novelty.</comment>
