<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between soldier past and gardener present feels embodied in "hands trained to wield swords, not seeds"; micro-choices like listening to bird calls deepen motivation. Slight emotional flattening in "he didn’t mind" under high stakes prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("battlefield was becoming a garden") crystallizes options with visible cost (reef's death as fertilizer). Accumulative lens holds, but tern's "Khalis" cry risks coincidental resolution rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Jetty's micro-setting (salt/freshwater collision) charges final image through "roots seeking purchase," yet environment doesn't constrain choices enough—digging depth dictated by birds, not terrain. Misses 9+ gate by narrow margin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when tern's cry triggers "Khalis," deepening resolve under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "fertilizer mixed from memories of reef’s final gasp," but reef’s death lacks immediate tactical pressure during planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action ("coax life from death"), not statement; final "earth remembers" reweights loss as hope without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo, though "narrow vastness" risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in bird-call decoding ("dialect of loss"), rhythmic control in twilight shifts. Minor register drift in "determined to let a garden reclaim the battlefield" slightly generic for voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but minor scaffold: "brittle shells cracking open to release tiny, pale roots" has redundant descriptors. No closure-tainting loops, yet figurative density ("sky bled from orange to indigo") slightly obscures action flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and linguistic recovery through "submerged concord"; "crushed bone and ash" fertilizer transforms cliché. Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
