<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular: grief embodied as "tremor in hands" and "sound like shattered glass," avoiding therapy-speak. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—laughing bitterly while seeking destruction—culminating in earned closure where she becomes a "seer" with visible cost ("observatory was gone").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara walking away transformed ("no longer a survivor") with undeniable cost (shattered observatory, lost past). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation—"node screamed," "vortex expanded"—reweighting stakes via sensory/emotional intensification without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Geode crystal functions as micro-setting: it constrains choices (pressing to console triggers the node) and charges closure (new crystal pulses in her hand). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through grief—e.g., "air reeked of ozone and ash" mirrors her emotional state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Elara's refusal to abort ("No. Keep scanning") deepens pressure under Accumulative lens, narrowing options through visceral intensification (node "screamed," "vortex expanded"). Cost is unmistakable—"observatory was gone"—reconfiguring her existence with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "unused potential is anger... grief" shouted into the vortex, not abstract moralizing. Final image ("veins of light stretching into the horizon") reweights the premise non-literally, rejecting tidy resolution for charged ambiguity where "awake" carries irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: stress narrows focus to "ozone and ash," while lyrical fragments ("Perturbation. She knew that word") mirror her fractured psyche. Rhythmic control heightens pressure—short sentences for alarms, flowing cadence for transformation—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion flawless. Sentences vary rhythm ("Alarms blared. 'Circuit breakers overheating.'") while maintaining density. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful ("laughter like shattered glass"), avoiding muddle even in peak beats like the node's dissolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis: "unused potential" as embodied grief/anger, not abstract energy. Risk-taking elevates stakes—Accumulative structure rejects tidy healing for "awake, not unbroken"—while geode's irreplaceable texture ("violet-hued shard biting palm") transforms drone-strike tropes through specific lived detail.</comment>
