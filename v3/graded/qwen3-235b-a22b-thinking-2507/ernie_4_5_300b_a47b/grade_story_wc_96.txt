<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in molting self vs. current poet identity, but "personality fractured" risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing ("become the anarchy" reframing resistance), but molting mechanism’s causality remains ambiguous under Accumulative lens despite moon-timed escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the coffee tin constrains choices (hiding/retrieval) and charges the final image, though rusted library’s atmospheric weight lacks tactical pressure on decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Cedar’s agency (writing as rebellion), but molting’s monthly constraint isn’t leveraged for visible trade-offs beyond internal shift; cost feels conceptual not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" emerges organically through tin/seeds imagery without moralizing; final poem’s "become the anarchy" delivers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flickering bulbs like desperate fireflies") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor filter-verb accumulation ("his mind wandered") in reflection beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("rebuild himself from fragments"/"how I rebuild") dull immediacy; no closure-impairing artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "molting" identity with prison-library setting; risk-taking in conceptual closure ("become the anarchy") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
