<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("preserve soul while appeasing suits") manifest in micro-choices like decoding graffiti under pressure; embodied cost in the stone chip’s worn edges avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Council’s retreat crystallizes stakes with tangible cost (chip smoothed by handling); Hybrid lens (causal escalation + accumulative symbolism) holds through withdrawal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Raft city’s micro-setting (mural’s raised paint, splintered planks) constrains Lira’s decoding choices; foundation chip charges final image by tethering "future unwritten" to tactile history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira’s agency (translating graffiti into map) narrows options to one confrontation; "looming deadline" symbolism tightens stakes, but timeframe urgency lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "chaos needs structure" refrain; final image of "chaos tempered by purpose" reweights premise without moralizing, embracing complexity (vendors’ resistance vs. Council’s "progress").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "orderly intuition told her balance was fraying"; Jax’s terse dialogue ("You’re late") contrasts Lira’s measured cadence, avoiding convergence under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chip’s weight felt heavier" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "intuition hummed" (abstract for peak tension) costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via "culture shock absorber" lens; graffiti-as-resistance system feels earned, though carnival setting risks familiarity without the stone chip’s specificity.</comment>
