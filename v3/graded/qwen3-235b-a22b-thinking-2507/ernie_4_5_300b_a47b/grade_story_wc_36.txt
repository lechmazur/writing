<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael's grief/resolution tapestry and "unmake failures" climax; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak despite high stakes. Minor flaw: mentor's "blade" riddle lacks character-particular texture, slightly diluting the pivotal confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—the broken flute's silence reconfigures options with felt cost ("reeds could be replaced, but the lesson was irreversible"). Orientation airtight by paragraph 1; accumulation escalates pressure without causal gaps under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thunder-Echo Range constrains choices via driftwood markers and "avalanchingly quiet" physics; the flute’s micro-setting charges the final image ("fragments safe in his pack, its song now a quiet hum"). Sensory hierarchy masterfully filters through Kael’s relic-keeper urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mastering the flute’s purpose) tightens through Kael’s discordant playing—agency drives the starfield collapse and Earned Stasis. Cost is unmistakable: snapped reeds, shattered past selves, and the visceral shift to "surrender" rune. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "unmaking failure" crystallizes in the broken flute and driftwood rearrangement. Final image ("surrender" rune, quiet hum) offers resonant, non-literal answer to "harvesting insights from failure" without moralizing—textbook Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature electrifies the prose ("stone spires clawed at the bruised sky," "avalanchingly quiet"). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure—staccato during the starfield collapse, fluid in reflection. Zero head-hopping; mentor’s dialogue stays filtered through Kael’s focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pierced the canyon hush like a needle through silk" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ("quiet hum in his chest") achieves closure with crystalline clarity. Only hairline slip: "tapestry of grief" slightly familiar, but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magical artifact" trope via specific mechanics (flute requires unmaking failure, not playing). Driftwood markers evolving from navigation tools to symbols of surrender feels inevitable yet fresh. Emotional specificity in "knelt in a pool of his own blood" avoids generic templates.</comment>
