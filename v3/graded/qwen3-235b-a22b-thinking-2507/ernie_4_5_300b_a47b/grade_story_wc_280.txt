<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction underdeveloped; Elias lacks wrestling with erasing specific timelines (e.g., flapper woman's disaster) despite high stakes. Micro-choices absent during critical pressure of mending fractures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (blank coin, fading Elias), but cost remains conceptual rather than embodied—no single line where loss of erased timelines' specificity is felt. Lens (Accumulative) holds, but cost proof test fails at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tarot coin and orchard constrain choices: coin anchors Elias's action, garden's sensory decay (rust/regret smell) charges the final mending. Micro-setting (coin) directly shapes tactics and final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (mending fractured possibilities) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible cost until finale. Agency drives echoes, yet Elias never confronts personal trade-offs (e.g., sacrificing one timeline's tragedy for "collective possibility").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of possibility as "dance" emerges through particulars (reversed Wheel, intertwined echoes), but ending avoids cost—erased Fool's journey lacks emotional weight. Final image reweights premise without moralizing, yet ambiguity feels unearned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthesia filters all observation ("apples tasted of autumn twilight"). Rhythmic control peaks in echo-weaving ("dancer’s laugh... poet’s whisper... child’s giggle"). No head-hopping; voice modulates tension through sensory compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor artifacts: "fractured timeline where possibilities withered" passive voice dulls immediacy; "hummed a tune... melody spiraling" comma splice. Otherwise high density ("leaves rustling a counterpoint"), but closure beat lacks visceral propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore/tarot/fractured time avoids tropes, but emotional specificity limited—Elias's "thrill of reprise" lacks tangible history. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens coherence, yet transformation test fails: plot works with generic "magic object."</comment>
