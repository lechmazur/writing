<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's borrowing of personalities manifests in concrete actions (Möbius poem, merchant posture) rather than labels, and his analytical/emotional contradiction crystallizes viscerally during the empathy merge. Minor deduction for "wildfires" abstraction momentarily flattening embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: fragment settling in Elias's palm with tears and Veyra's softened scowl reconfigures the "mirror" premise with felt cost. Causal escalation holds perfectly except slight press malfunction convenience during climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: letterpress mechanics (random dials, gibberish output) directly constrain choices and charge the final image of ink-stamped poetry. "Vanishing stars" timeframe lacks tactical pressure, limiting higher band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (math vs. lived emotion) tightens through Elias's agency-driven disorientation experiment. Cost is unmistakable in his crumbling detachment and tears, though Veyra's "Stop!" lacks sufficient tactical consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "sorrow of a sunset is a comma in the dark" reprises as emotional truth without moralizing. Final image (fragment obedient, stars returned) resonates as non-literal answer to mathematical reductionism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sine waves of joy," equations) persists under pressure, but Veyra's dialogue lacks character-specific idiom ("You're late" functional but generic). Rhythmic control excels in chaos sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "burnt sapphire and iron filings" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "wildfires" metaphor bordering on abstraction during high-pressure empathy merge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and emotional mathematics feels inevitable, with "transposed empathy" driving organic stakes. Personality borrowing trait slightly familiar, but redeemed by concrete letterpress integration.</comment>
