<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clara’s embodied motivation ("regret was her currency") and Elias’s trembling hands reveal contradictory impulses without summary. Final choice—playing imperfectly—earns closure via prior causality, though Lila’s voice lacks full flaw integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (glow, voice, chainsaws) creates Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (memory made tangible then lost). Slight backstory summary in Elias’s explanation prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archive constrains choices: dust scent informs Clara’s motivation, workers’ chainsaws apply temporal pressure, and the bottle’s copper dove charges the final image. Environment directly shapes the climax’s mechanics and cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: the voice’s accusation ("You left me here") forces song completion, narrowing options. Cost—empty bottle, roaring chainsaws—is unmistakable and reweights reconciliation as bittersweet loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "imperfect miracles" gains resonance via the flawed séance and empty bottle. Final image (chainsaws roaring) reweights memory without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust smelled of regret") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "prismatic shards" during climax slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t fracture the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "refracting it into prismatic shards" in high-pressure beat muddles figurative density. Otherwise, propulsion and specificity (e.g., "viscous drop") excel without artifacts touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: "gossip-column exorcist" and scientific séance mechanics feel inevitable. Risk-taking (copper conductivity as grief conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
