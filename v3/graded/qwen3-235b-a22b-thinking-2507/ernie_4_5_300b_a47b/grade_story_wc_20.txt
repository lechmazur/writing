<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (logic/magic) drives the coin ritual; embodied grief ("ache in bones," "throat tightened") earns Lira's fade-out. Slight thematic echo in her "shed it" line risks over-articulation but avoids diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (empty-air reach, extinguished glow) under Accumulative lens. Orientation Test fails: "after the fire" at 118 words lacks temporal anchor, triggering -0.4 deduction despite functional disorientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Foundry constraints choice (molten pit enables ritual); rain-washed iron/earth smell charges final dimming. Coin's fusion into metal reweights kintsugi from metaphor to physical truth, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding Lira's fate) tightens via ritual escalation. Cost is legible in Kael's endurance of ambiguity, but "kintsugi intentions" line explains rather than dramatizes the pressure shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coin/foundry particulars: "shed it" and "empty air" reconfigure "weight of names" without moralizing. Final image ("light dimmed") resonates as non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("factually mystical blend," "soot-streaked hands"); tense briefly slips in childhood flashback but recovers. No head-hopping; voice modulates with ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "wavered, translucent and shimmering" slightly loops with "woven from starlight." No closure artifacts, but minor redundancy in Lira's description deducts 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemy tropes transformed by foundry specificity; "jagged coin" and "luminous regret" feel inevitable. Risk-taking in tone heightens stakes without gimmickry, satisfying 9+ quick test.</comment>
