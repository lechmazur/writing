<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s interior contradiction (“fixing isn’t transformation”) manifests in embodied micro-choices (trembling hands, releasing bugs without watching). Secondary character lacks depth despite pivotal role; his fire-scarred face and abrupt vanishing feel archetypal rather than individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lira’s shift from habitual helping to purposeful listening forecloses her “stitching wounds” approach with visible cost (volcano’s quieted rumble, transformed sand). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via hush density buildup, though the stranger’s origin remains unanchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Black sand beach functions as micro-setting that charges closure: warming sand underfoot reweights transformation’s texture. Volcano’s hiss and charcoal grit constrain Lira’s actions (jar releases, shadow map), avoiding postcard description through tactile cause-effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency—releasing the final bug crystallizes her stance shift from “fixing” to listening. Cost is visceral (earth’s shift) and conceptual (abandoning control), though the stranger’s prophecy exposition risks coincidence-as-resolution under Situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: “rough, unpredictable, and alive” transformation replaces Lira’s tidy “fixing” via the glowing shadow map. Final image avoids moralizing while charging prior material—no thematic echo or forced binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stress: Lira’s focus narrows to hush vibrations and bug light during confrontation. Voice modulates rhythm from lyrical (“stars burned low and slow”) to staccato (“She didn’t know what tomorrow would bring”) without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-loop in “stitching old wounds... messy, violent, beautiful” slightly dulls escalation. Otherwise, propulsion is relentless: “charcoal grit” to “glowing imprint” progression avoids scaffolding while maintaining textural density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes prophecy tropes through granular specificity—bottled lightning bugs as “stolen moments of light” reframe fate as accumulative, textural work. Risk in abstract concepts (hush as language) pays off via concrete cost (shifting earth), avoiding derivative middle-ground hedging.</comment>
