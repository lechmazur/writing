<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s tactile grief ("key tag burned against his thigh") and earned final whisper, though "hides behind truth" remains label-only without mid-scene testing of his denial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when Elias places the key on the desk—"I see you now" crystallizes his stance with palpable cost, under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density reweights grief’s weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken library’s pristine state directly constrains Elias’s choices (opening door 13, touching books), charging the final image as water "parts" before him—a micro-setting that reshapes his emotional tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s wading into water and key-turning, narrowing options toward signification; the cost—releasing his locked vow—is unmistakable when he leaves the key, foreclosing his old path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the book’s hum ("cerulean for joy, crimson for grief"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "luminous vows" as heart-language without stating a moral, answering the quest through embodied resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias’s light-focused POV ("amber glow barely piercing the meteor hush") modulates perfectly under pressure, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the library’s hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "squelching on soggy carpet" exemplifies textural specificity, though "meteor hush" slightly strains register in one high-pressure beat without pattern reinforcement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sunken-library trope with "color of sound" quest feels inevitable—Elias’s lamplighter vocation transforms cliché into emotional specificity, avoiding safety-middle through bold sensory stakes.</comment>
