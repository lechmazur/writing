<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila's "cautiously hopeful" trait manifests in micro-choices (admitting uncertainty while acting), but her flawless execution against ancient entities lacks believable struggle. Professor Hale serves only as exposition conduit without altering her choices, weakening relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the resonant tone and softened campus arguments, but the cosmic voice's late arrival after truce resolution creates a causality hiccup—escalation should culminate in the truce beat, not follow it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The radio station's transmitter hum and oscilloscopes function as micro-setting that constrains choice (calibrating frequencies) and charges the final image ("loyal beast awaiting command"), though campus unrest remains generically described.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (community division vs. cosmic chaos) tighten through Lila's frequency gamble, with visible cost in the haunting note. But tricksters' motivation ("power plays for sport") lacks depth, weakening the moral calculus of her interference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through cosmic chess imagery, but the cosmic voice's "power is a river" line risks thematic echo—elevated by Lila's whispered "I'll dam it" reweighting prior tension without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in technical details ("subsonic frequencies ripple through ionosphere"), though Professor Hale's "crossed himself" momentarily drifts from his established skepticism without character justification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grammar><comment>"Bitter liquid sharpening her focus" triggers cliché loop; "shattering glass" simile contradicts established "starlight wind chimes" texture. Minor artifacts avoid closure impact but prevent 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic horror tropes via radio engineering specifics (subsonic frequencies, oscilloscopes), though the "chosen one" arc feels familiar. Risk-taking in cosmic voice dialogue heightens stakes but edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
