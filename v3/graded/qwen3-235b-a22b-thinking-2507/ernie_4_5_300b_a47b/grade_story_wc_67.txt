<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (mask removal revealing "fatigue and resolve") but "ache pulses like a second heart" risks therapy-speak abstraction. Contradictory impulses—seeking permanence while creating impermanent art—drive credible endurance with visible cost in the unfinished portrait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "Safety is an illusion, and art is the only truth worth chasing" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("ash on her hands glittering like stardust"). Accumulative lens holds through density increase in the gallery's shudder and deliberate powder-sprinkling ritual narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gallery functions as active micro-setting: its impermanent art pressures Lira's choices (Elias' warning), while the mask constrains action and charges the final image ("porcelain edges biting into her skin"). Environment shapes tactics—ash portraits demand viewer imagination, making closure inevitable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Lira's agency: "crystallize a fleeting emotion" vs. "mirage of safety" tightens when she whispers "This is for you" to the incomplete portrait. Cost is legible in the blurring edges and gallery's exhale—art must vanish to matter, foreclosing preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the ash portrait's "hazy silhouette" reweights "mirage of safety" without moralizing. Final image ("fleeting emotion, crystallized in ash and absence") offers non-literal answer to transience, avoiding thematic echo through embodied cost (Lira's glittering ash hands).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"shadows pool and fade, as though the very architecture resents permanence" filters setting through Lira's artistic lens. Rhythm modulates with pressure: ritualistic cadence during powder-sprinkling shifts to fragmented urgency as the gallery "shudders."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose soars with textural specificity ("fingertips leaving faint smudges in the ash") but minor overwriting in the opening ("soft, expectant hush that lingers like the final note of a violin") slightly dulls propulsion. Zero loops in closure beat; ash/stardust metaphor recharges meaning without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms art-world tropes through visceral specifics: porcelain mask as "armor" of "regret" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes—dawn breaking beyond walls while time "bends" in the gallery—without gimmickry, making impermanence feel inevitable.</comment>
