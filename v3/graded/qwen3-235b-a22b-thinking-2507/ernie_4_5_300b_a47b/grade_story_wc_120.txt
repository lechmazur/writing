<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (writing faster before exhaustion hits), but "exhaustion loomed like a thief" edges toward bodily cliché without sufficient specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("before exhaustion hit" tightening to "it was enough"), though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) risks cap if not held through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that charges closure (dimming light = acceptance), but frozen lake remains postcard backdrop without constraining choices despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through dawn's progression ("before exhaustion hit" live clock), but exhaustion as pressure lacks visceral manifestation beyond metaphor until late payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars (fortunes as "maps" to mirrored horizon), with final "it was enough" reweighting time's linearity without moralizing—pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prismatic shadows," "crushed moonstone ink") modulates rhythm under pressure, though "exhaustion loomed like a thief" slightly disrupts voice consistency in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless density ("amber and violet" hues doing triple duty), but "exhaustion loomed like a thief" constitutes a minor scaffold loop that dulls urgency in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms fortune-telling trope through "architect of memories" specificity; "chronological homesickness" avoids quirkiness via tangible tradeoffs in every action.</comment>
