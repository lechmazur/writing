<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is deeply personal and consistent, but her internal conflict between hope and grief lacks layered embodiment during the climax; the whispered laugh resolution feels earned though.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("It’s not empty, it’s a seed") crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through sensory pressure buildup to the final quill glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse actively constrains choices (flytraps forcing nectar use, sector confusion), and the final planting image charges the oasis’s absence, but the tool (quill) doesn’t fully constrain mid-scene tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through the quill’s wilting and keeper’s confession, reweighting the "truth" stake, but escalation leans slightly on the keeper’s exposition rather than Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Candor in small moments" emerges organically through the seed metaphor and whispered laugh without moralizing; the final image reweights the Archive’s purpose as generative rather than salvific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s voice has distinct texture ("ink shimmered like poisoned honey"), but the keeper’s dialogue lacks idiom differentiation; rhythmic control wavers slightly during confrontation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with vivid specificity, but early "quill wilts near dishonesty" is told rather than shown, and minor filter verbs ("she felt") dilute immediacy in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lost archive" trope through crystallized conversations as energy source; the "seed" reconfiguration feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding derivative safety-middle choices.</comment>
