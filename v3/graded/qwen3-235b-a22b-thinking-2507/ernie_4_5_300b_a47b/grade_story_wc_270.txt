<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in her insurgent past versus nurturing choice, but final thematic articulation edges toward echo ("Tradition would evolve, not die"). Micro-choices like blistered digging hands earn her evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: planting embryo crystallizes "tradition evolves" with felt cost (risking drone retaliation). Causal chain holds from kite to vault; cost legible in "legs steady despite her age" as physical/emotional toll.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Volcanic springs actively constrain choices—steamy air obscures, soil blisters hands—and charge closure as embryo light seeps into bubbling water. Blackberry thorns scratching knuckles during kite retrieval pays off in digging stamina.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: regime's weaponized destiny versus her "seed" insight. Pressure peaks when plants hiss "choose wisely," forcing trade-off with visible cost in her exhaustion and implied social risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—planting embryo as nurture, not control—without moralizing. Final image "nurture like a seed" reweights "implanted destiny" with earned resonance, avoiding false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in plant telepathy ("melody of roots") and stress-tightened syntax ("Dig here. Before drones return"). Minor register drift with "implanted destiny" phrase, but justified as plant-whispered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density like "kite’s tail fluttered... wounded bird" advances plot. Final line "insurgent grandmother" has crystalline cadence. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure digging scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathic grandma reimagines genetic embryo through cultural tradition. Specifics like "wooden charms" prevent abstraction; emotional truth in 72yo blistered hands elevates beyond trope.</comment>
