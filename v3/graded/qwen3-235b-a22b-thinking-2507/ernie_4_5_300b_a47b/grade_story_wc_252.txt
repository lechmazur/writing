<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs. freedom) drive micro-choices like clutching then detaching the scrimshaw, earning her transformation. Epiphany slightly abstract in "combative tenderness" line risks label-speak but avoids full diagnostic phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the weight of the past finally lifted" crystallizes liberation after island dissolution. Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure, though whale’s appearance edges toward coincidence complicating rather than resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe constrains choice (swimming through kelp/darkness) and charges closure; scrimshaw as micro-setting evolves from talisman to dissolved catalyst. Final image of Lira swimming into "vast and full of possibility" reweights the environment’s meaning with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: her decision to follow the call and detach scrimshaw narrows options to irreversible departure. Cost is unmistakable in "island fractured, pieces... slipping into the sea like tears," foreclosing home with visceral, felt loss under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—detachment as freedom—without moralizing. Final image of swimming toward horizon offers resonant answer to "true nature" question. Slight thematic echo in "combative tenderness" risks abstraction but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: dock worker’s tactile awareness ("boots sinking," "muscles coiled") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in swim sequence, though "liberating calm" momentarily drifts toward generic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" and "strange, liberating calm" inject label-speak into peak beats, dulling embodied cost. Otherwise clean propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Minor abstraction in high-pressure moments blocks 8.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disappearing island trope through dock worker’s embodied perspective. Scrimshaw’s dissolution as catalyst feels earned, avoiding derivative safety. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
