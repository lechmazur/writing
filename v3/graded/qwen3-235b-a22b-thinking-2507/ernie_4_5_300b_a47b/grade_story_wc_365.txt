<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s "hollow ache" after discarding the shard—truth-seeking versus the cost of knowing. Embodied emotion ("throbbed like a second heartbeat") avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation earned by mother’s warning and visceral shard pull.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: hurling the shard forecloses his quest with visible cost ("hollow ache," lingering ozone). Causal lens holds throughout—shard’s compulsion drives every beat to the decisive choice. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport’s rust-to-gleam shift charges the parallel world reveal. The shard functions as micro-setting object—its sharp edges and warmth constrain choices, culminating in the discarded final image where dust settles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (pursuing truth) tightens when shard overrides caution, forcing the jump. Visible price paid: lifelong search ends in hollow resolution ("weight was gone"). Escalation driven by Kael’s agency under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "truth was a knife that cuts both ways" shown via Kael’s realization, not stated. Final image reweights the opening "murmur of dreams" into "quiet hum of possibility" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature as sensory map maker: reality filtered through visor’s "mosaic of colors." Rhythmic control under pressure ("He fell. Gravity reversed.") with no head-hopping. Elision of mother’s backstory taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dust motes swirled... catching faint hues—a mosaic only he could see" does triple duty). Final line’s "cyclically spontaneous" reprises opening with reweighted meaning. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis via "cyclically spontaneous" compulsion and shard as choice, not tool. Emotional truth in "hollow ache" avoids generic tropes. Risk-taking in Earned Stasis closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
