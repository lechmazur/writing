<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (avoiding edges vs embracing brink) drive micro-choices like respirator removal; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak despite near-miss with "kintsugi isn't about perfection" phrasing in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (burning lungs, popped gear); "between breaths" motif taught early pays off in final silence; statue's dialogue risks convenience but earns causality through charm's physical sync.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Acid sea constrains choices (respirator necessity, copper dissolution) and charges final image as mirror; charm's silver biting palm directly alters Lira's tactics at climax; neon-green specificity avoids generic dystopia.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency (pressing charm despite burning fumes); cost is unmistakable in workshop shudder and raw laughter; acid sea's shift from enemy to mirror reweights options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (shattered flask → mending choice), not abstraction; final image ("acid sea stilled") reweights "kintsugi" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via visceral cost of respirator removal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "fumes eating the air like a thief"; rhythm modulates perfectly under stress (short sentences during surge); "sound raw and unfamiliar" shows voice distinct from Lira's earlier muffled uncertainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax beats; "storm of gold and glass" slightly overwrites but pays off in closure; minor cliché ("tears stinging") avoided fatal artifact penalty by being tethered to physical action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of kintsugi as psychological survival, not craft; "dire enchantment" tone avoids whimsy through acid sea's physical consequences; respirator removal as acceptance feels genuinely new within trope.</comment>
