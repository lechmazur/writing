<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("weight pressed into ribs") but "aesthetically driven" trait remains abstract without tangible tradeoffs under pressure; micro-choices lack contradictory impulses during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (stepping onto liquid glass) reconfigures meaning with felt cost, but the "tremor of certainty" lacks visible sacrifice—euphoria overshadows concrete stakes in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (ripples under touch, becomes threshold); "liquid glass" image charges closure by transforming ice into charged symbol without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally (humming intensifies → ice cracks) but agency feels passive—Lirael's paraphrasing magically alters reality without earned cost or tactical tradeoffs; pressure lacks visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "liquid glass" reprise avoiding moralizing, but "sacred/profane" tension remains intellectualized; final image resonates yet lacks moral complexity to reach 9+ band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quartz veins singing," "lantern-moth hush") sustains rhythmic control under pressure; zero register drift despite lyrical density; patterned elision taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "tremor of certainty" repetition in final third creates subtle synonym churn; "soft glowing dust" slightly overwrites the pivotal transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Cloud-shadow poet" trope transformed via tactile specificity (stone "ripples like water"), but ban lifting feels convenient—cost lacks grit despite fresh "liquid glass" synthesis.</comment>
