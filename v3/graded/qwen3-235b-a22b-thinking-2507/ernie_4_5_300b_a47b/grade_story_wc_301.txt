<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's clinical mapping vs. raw guilt, embodied through trembling hands drawing her heart map. Avoids therapy-speak by grounding "stagnant pool" metaphor in physical river observation. Medication backstory lacks present-tense tactical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "Begin" graffiti—reconfiguring prior graffiti into actionable hope with felt cost in her shaky heart map. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through layered graffiti discoveries. Medication timeline remains passive setup rather than active pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ivy functions as micro-setting constraint—preserving graffiti Mara must physically trace, culminating in the final "Begin" image charging closure. Station's liminality ("neither city nor wilderness") actively shapes her emotional navigation. Avoids symbolic convenience through tactile details like clogged drainpipe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Mara's agency: following drainpipe chalk line to riverbank, then drawing her heart map. Cost is visceral—shaking hands as clinical detachment shatters. Medication absence doesn't actively narrow options; "three weeks" remains backstory not live clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete river/graffiti parallels ("forgiveness is a current"), not abstraction. Final "Begin" reweights all graffiti into non-literal answer about starting anew. Risks thematic echo with "river remembers" but saves it through Mara's physical reaction (breath hitching).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "green fingers" ivy and "sluggish" Thames—Mara's river chronicler lens filters all observation. Rhythm modulates perfectly from clinical ("daringly methodical") to raw ("creaking" accordion). No head-hopping; unreliability signaled through sensory precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "bellows—patched with electrical tape" doing triple duty. "Raw, unfiltered edge" slightly drifts toward therapy-speak but redeemed by immediate concrete action (tracing brick grooves). Final "gilding ivy in gold" crystallizes earned solace without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicler + graffiti archaeology transforms self-forgiveness trope. Emotional truth in "stagnant pool" guilt versus river's flow avoids generic templates. Bold risk in using bathroom graffiti as emotional cartography—feels inevitable through Mara's occupation.</comment>
