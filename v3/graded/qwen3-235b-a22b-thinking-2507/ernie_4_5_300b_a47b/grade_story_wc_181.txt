<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction ("bewildered and certain") but "simply complicated" remains telling not showing; micro-choices like pressing the cameo fuse character and closure though motivation lacks specific roots beyond generic "hunger".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "would never believe her. But that was fine" crystallizes cost of chosen truth with conceptual stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through cameo iterations tightening meaning toward final disquiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Astral orchard’s liquid-light waterfall grotto functions as micro-setting that charges closure: iridescent water reflection dissolves into library vision, making environment actively constrain the inheritance choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through cameo’s evolving iterations—from blank to portrait to map—narrowing Elara’s options toward the tree fusion. Cost of forbidden knowledge lands in "museum board would never believe her" with visible professional exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance gains resonance through pistachio shell’s physical reprise: final "brightened disquiet" reweights the opening bewilderment without moralizing, rejecting blood/time for lived truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "blossoms whispering a language she almost recognized" filters cosmos through curator’s lens. Minor tension in "forbidden knowledge" phrasing slightly drifts from character voice mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "quiet, brightened disquiet" achieves high density. Slight overwriting in "roots anchored in soil that pulsed with faint blue glow" (redundant "faint") prevents 9.0 despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "heirloom" trope via fractal cameos that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric compression of library vision) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—specific disquiet replaces generic wonder.</comment>
