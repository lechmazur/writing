<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("obsession lay in the way time folded") with diagnostic phrasing ("retrocognitively trapped"), weakening embodied emotion. Final choice to design mazes "to remember" is earned by prior causality, but contradictions lack simultaneous tension during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (time as story, not texture) with visible cost in inert fragment and lost visions. Minor causality hiccup: garden's reformation feels slightly convenient without clear constraint from prior disintegration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Living bridge actively constrains choices (shifting planks, retracting vines) and charges final image through reformed garden's glowing photos. Micro-setting (halo fragment) functions as essential tool, with "pixelate" and "unraveled" verbs embodying pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as photos disintegrate and visions overwhelm; agency drives escalation through Elara's deliberate fragment placement. Cost is unmistakable in "retrocognitive visions were gone" and the fragment's inert state, reshaping her future choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through photos' transformation from "fading" to "glowing," reweighting time as narrative without moralizing. Final line ("design one to remember") offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petals unfolded in slow-motion symphonies," "edges curled like dry leaves") with rhythmic control during disintegration ("And then, disintegration"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding in high-pressure beat ("she believed, were keys"; "visions surged, overwhelming her") slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, high density ("garden shuddered. Vines retracted") and vivid verbs ("pixelate," "unraveled") propel momentum without closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time theory and garden magic avoids cliché through tactile details (fragment "biting into her palm"). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes, with "story to be told" reframing feeling earned through prior particulars.</comment>
