<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Nessar seeks to "blunt" remorse yet risks entanglement, embodied in "salt and iron" memory tasting. Micro-choice to submerge hands despite numbing cold reveals hierarchy of values. No therapy-speak; guilt becomes "a knife but a grain of sand" through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Nessar's "unsteady" legs and guards' "softer" expressions prove remorse transformed, not erased. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory density (numbing fingers → fractured memory → lighter air). Rain-soaked walls anchor orientation by line 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coral pavilion functions as micro-setting: brackish pool's tidal formations constrain Nessar's analysis and charge the final image ("taste of memory fading" as he cooks). Desert rain evolves causally (condensation for tasting → "brittleness tempered"). Misses 9+ as dunes don't actively pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (dilute remorse without becoming its vessel) tightens through Nessar's agency: pressing palms to door, submerging hands deeper. Cost is visceral—founder's guilt "becoming his own" then fracturing. Accumulative escalation reweights burden from "knife" to "grain of sand" under sustained pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: broth "bitterness softened by ghost of forgiveness" embodies earned wisdom. No moralizing; "grain of sand" metaphor recharges desert setting without stating moral. Final cooking sequence answers central question—nourishing present outweighs erasing past—through sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tongue could taste memories," "eyes storm-cloud color." Rhythmic control under pressure—shorter sentences during memory surge ("He gasped... Then, as suddenly..."). No head-hopping; free indirect style clean ("His motivation was simple...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "salt and iron, sting of tears" does triple duty. Final line recharges "sand" motif without stating moral. Avoids overwriting: "taste of memory fading" not "lingering essence." Minor flaw: "emotionally contagious nature" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate embodiment ("risked becoming vessels").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms memory-taste trope through specific stakes: remorse as "bitter herb" requiring tempering. Coral pavilion's tidal formations demand decoding, not passive observation. Fresh inflection: remorse diluted to "grain of sand" via shared burden, avoiding erasure tropes. Safety middle avoided.</comment>
