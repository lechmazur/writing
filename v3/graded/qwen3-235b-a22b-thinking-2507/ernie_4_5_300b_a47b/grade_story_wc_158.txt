<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "poetry as shield" vs. "bridge" shift, but "shyly unstoppable certainty" reads as diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, undermining embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: tree's song embodies "centuries of longing made tangible" with conceptual cost, under Accumulative lens where sensory density reweights pain/beauty coexistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell actively constrains choices (solitude, single window) and charges closure as tree grows "in the shell’s bones," making environment indispensable to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lira’s agency (writing in tidal pools), but "days passed, then years, then centuries" summary weakens pressure escalation; cost ("centuries of longing") remains visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (planting seed, singing), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "blossom armistice" as "fragile, unstoppable" coexistence without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruises beneath her eyes" mirroring nebula) and rhythmic control elevate tension, though "shyly unstoppable" slightly disrupts voice consistency in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "half-sung lullabies clung like second skin" exemplifies textural density, but "shyly unstoppable certainty" is weak phrasing that slightly dulls the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine biology and poetic labor transforms tropes; "photosynthesize pain into beauty" made concrete through kelp postcard and reef-shadow joy, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
