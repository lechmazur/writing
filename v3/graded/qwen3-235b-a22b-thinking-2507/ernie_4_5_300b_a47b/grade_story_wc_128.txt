<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara’s cargo-broker precision clashing with emotional outreach (forging the conductor’s letter), embodied through micro-choices like tapping the locket frame. No diagnostic labels; the "ache of unspoken things" roots epiphany in concrete sensory history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final "cycle turned anew" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (Clara’s initial blindness to Lila). But the boardinghouse discovery strains causality—Eleanor’s abrupt departure feels convenient, slightly undermining pressure escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Library’s "breezy, paper-scented calm" and harbor setting constrain choices (envelope discovery via fan breeze), while the locket photo charges the final image. Yet the concert hall’s opening presence fades, missing deeper integration with the maritime motif central to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Clara recognizes Lila in the photo, creating visible cost (her hurried past indifference). Agency drives the forged letter, but the boardinghouse scene relies on coincidence—Eleanor’s departure "weeks ago" lacks causal pressure, diluting escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts (steadying shells, forged letter), avoiding moralizing. The final "rustle of pages, clatter of shells" resonates non-literally. But the conductor’s letter borders on symbolic convenience, slightly weakening organic emergence of "cycles of compassion."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices "freight rates" mid-concert, "spines worn by decades of readers." Rhythmic control falters slightly in the boardinghouse scene with elevated diction ("silent contributor to the harbor’s rhythm"), but compression serves the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "mind looping between numbers and the ache of unspoken things" followed by "restless" repetition dulls momentum. Figurative language stays clean in peak beats, but the "compassion, like the sea" metaphor verges on patness without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms kindness-chain tropes through maritime specificity (cargo manifests, "silent crew" lexicon). Emotional truth in Clara’s flawed outreach (forging letter) elevates freshness. But the boardinghouse coincidence feels template-like, missing bold risk-taking to reach 9.0+.</comment>
