<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s contradiction—seeing ancestors yet declaring "I am not you"—creates embodied tension without therapy-speak; her micro-choice placing palm on the sundial reveals value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "no longer a contemporary of the dead; pioneer of the living" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost, but lens (Accumulative) isn’t explicitly named by midpoint, capping high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal library’s shifting floors supply new chambers mid-crisis, directly enabling her documentation; coral walls and atomically reflective sundial charge the final image of writing her story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via the hum’s crescendo narrows options to coexistence vs. dissolution; cost is legible in her shift from "fragile, brittle moment" to observing the world "without fear," though one tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image of placing *Brittle Awakenings* on a new shelf reweights "isolation into independence" without moralizing; the spiral symbol embodies earned wisdom through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "pages fluttering like wings" and hum "coaxing shelves to sway"; syntax compresses under pressure ("She smiled, her reflection wavering but steady") without losing rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ink that shifted color with her mood" exemplifies high-density texture. Minor deduction for "primordial" lacking specificity in peak beat, but closure remains vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "extinct species survivor" trope via documentation-as-survival; the tidal library’s logic (shifting tides revealing tools) synthesizes setting and theme into inevitable risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
