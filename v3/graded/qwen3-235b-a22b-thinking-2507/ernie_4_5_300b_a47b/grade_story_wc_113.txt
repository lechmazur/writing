<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest physically: trembling hands yet decisive memorization of symbols. Final choice earned by prior causality (dismissing smudges until symbols match sheet music), with visible cost in soaked state and lost program. No diagnostic labels, only embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost: "I'll finish it" forecloses skepticism while accepting the ghost's burden. Accumulative lens holds—water's humming melody deepens pressure until pipe surge forces memorization. Cost legible in drenched clothes and floating program.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Floodwaters function as micro-setting: ankle-deep constraint shapes movement (sloshing boots), enables symbol revelation (dipping program), and charges closure (timpani thrumming through water). Final soggy program reweights the environment's role from obstacle to conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (proving ghost's existence) tightens when symbols match sheet music, then surges via pipe coincidence. Agency evident in memorizing code despite physical cost; visible price paid in soaked state altering tactics (clutching notebook). Coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"In-between spaces" evolves from Clara's preference to active bridge between living/dead. Final image (soggy program floating beside her) reweights it as shared language without moralizing. Theme emerges through timpani thrumming—resonant answer to "where ghosts and musicians speak the same language."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct musician perceptual signature: notices "hush of unstruck chords," "cello bow like spider silk." Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical during symbol discovery ("water seemed to ripple in time with her heartbeat"), staccato during pipe surge. Zero head-hopping; voice consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. Sentences do triple duty: "lanterns dimmed, and the theater sighed" merges setting, atmosphere, and closure. Final line recharges opening "hush" with "create from the silence," avoiding figurative muddle. Propulsion flawless—"gush of water surged" accelerates crisis without slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through musician-specific lens: symbols as musical code, "in-between spaces" tied to crescendos. Emotional truth in motivation—not curiosity but needing proof for skeptics. Transformation test: replacing "timpanist" with generic "musician" breaks causal logic (timpani thrumming closure).</comment>
