<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("lungs burning") but lacks contradictory impulses during climax; motivation clear though grandmother backstory feels summarily delivered without altering present tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost ("code remains unbroken"), but orientation fails past 120 words: "radiant grotto" location unstated despite prism atrium's centrality to conflict resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as micro-setting (constrains music/light tactics), yet grotto geography remains vague ("moss-carpeted floor" without spatial context), limiting environmental pressure on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (colors deepening to violet), but antagonist defeat feels coincidental—Elias's "frantic staccato" lacks tactical choice beyond volume, missing agency-driven escalation for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Final image ("secrets safe in negative space") recharges saxophone method with conceptual cost, though "eerie nostalgia" motif slightly drifts from prophecy's generational trauma core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct jazz-inflected rhythm ("frantic staccato," "wail drowning out words") modulates perfectly under stress; sensory hierarchy narrows to sound/light during confrontation without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minimal artifacts, but "vested hush" repetition (3x) creates synonym churn; prophecy dialogue's abstract nouns ("the veil thins") clash with Elias's embodied POV in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Negative-space saxophone method transforms prophecy trope through specific musical constraint; "radiant grotto" avoids derivative mist-setting via prism light as literal/conceptual weapon.</comment>
