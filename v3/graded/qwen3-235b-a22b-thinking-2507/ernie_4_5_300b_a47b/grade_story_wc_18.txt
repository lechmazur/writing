<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown through Elias' steady hands versus breath catching at "runaway dream" mention. Micro-choice to hand over mirror carries visible cost but stranger's underdevelopment limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: sextant's reversed gears make "boundaries navigated not erased" legible with cost in "needle pointed inward." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to twilight frost path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Environment charges closure: ruined orchard's fog directly enables the glass-mountain path, while frost-shimmer transitions from setting detail to literal pathway. Micro-setting constraint in mirror circle's spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through synchronized breathing sequence—protagonist agency drives escalation as breath coordination narrows options. Cost crystallizes when Elias relinquishes the mirror, foreclosing dream-return path with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through sextant's reversal: "boundaries navigated" reweights premise without moralizing. Final mirror crafting embodies earned wisdom about breath-space reflection, avoiding thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Elias notices glass fractures and frost patterns. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in "breathed as one" sequence where sentence cadence mirrors inhalation/exhalation without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or overwriting; "frost-kissed leaves like second skin" achieves triple duty (sensory, setting, theme). Only minor artifact: "faint scent of starlight" slightly strains physical logic but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "runaway dream" trope through sextant-as-mapping-tool logic. Glass mountains feel inevitable yet fresh, with bold risk in making boundaries navigable rather than erasable—heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
