<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("rediscover wild frontier") remains abstract; internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal "let go" moment. No visible cost to releasing the gear despite father’s hologram vanishing—she smiles, undercutting Earned Stasis. Strength: embodied perception via wind-hum mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (moss transformation) lacks legible cost; "probable miracles were inevitable" dodges price of renunciation. Accumulative lens holds via humming density, but cost proof test fails—no sentence/image where loss is felt. Strength: orientation solid by para 1, lens consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: gear socket demands action, wind tones guide chord creation. Final moss/steel shift charges closure image with bioluminescent veins. Strength: brassbark oaks vibrating ribs embodies sensory hierarchy; micro-setting (gear) essential to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes (find wild frontier) lack escalation—no tradeoffs or narrowed options. "Let go" demand faces zero resistance; father’s hologram vanishes without emotional cost altering tactics. Strength: dominant stake signaled early via "raw, untamed world" quest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme ("thought and matter intertwined") emerges through brassbark vibrations, not moralizing. But final line "probable miracles were inevitable" skirts thematic echo penalty—saved by wind-sound reprise. Strength: no overt allegory; resonance via gear-as-seed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gears grew like leaves," copperwillows "trill like tuning forks" filter world through mechanic’s lens. Tension modulates syntax ("Elara closed her eyes, letting..."). Near-flaw: "prickling awareness" slightly over-explains sixth sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rust-caked roots" and "bioluminescent light" show textural specificity. Minor scaffold: "she believed that if she could decode..." dilutes momentum. Strength: final line recharges opening motif with "wind through different trees" cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanical forest as brain (gears=neurons) avoids steampunk cliché via humming biomechanics. But "wild frontier of mind" trope feels derivative; emotional specificity lacks grit. Strength: gear-as-seed reconfiguration grows from prior particulars.</comment>
