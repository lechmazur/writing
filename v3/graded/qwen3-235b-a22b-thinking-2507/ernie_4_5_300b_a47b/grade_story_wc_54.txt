<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "raw, untested" equation as both triumph and vulnerability; embodied emotion avoids labels via "stoic wonder filling her chest" during functional resurrection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost: the untested equation’s "hypothesis waiting for validation" crystallizes stakes under Accumulative lens; terminal shudder-to-hum escalation narrows options through rerouting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spaceport terminal functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—conduits rerouted with engineering tools—and charges final image via pendant; moonlight pools on crater enable sextant activation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through Lila’s agency: rerouting flows transforms "stagnant" energy into luminous equation; cost legible in "raw, untested" formula that forecloses easy nostalgia for the terminal’s past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "redirected flows" metaphor without moralizing; final image reweights "resurrection" as repurposing ("courage to repurpose the old into the new"), charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in engineer’s gaze ("structural calculations," "recalibrating conduits"); rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented cadence during activation ("Dust swirled as dormant lights flickered to life").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "sextant’s celestial patterns" resonate with hum; "bruised twilight sky" avoids cliché through concrete texture in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "resurrection" trope via engineering repurposing; specificity of "constellations no longer visible" grounds cosmic scale in tactile detail, avoiding abstract novelty.</comment>
