<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction (weaving truth vs. shattering illusions) drives micro-choices under pressure, but the living characters’ off-page status limits on-scene relationship crucibles despite strong embodied emotion in dream sequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Kael placing the globe triggers the ice’s hum and candle flare, crystallizing the "fragile threads" cost with undeniable conceptual weight under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The warped snow globe functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (catching "last flicker of candlelight"), constraining Kael’s method while evolving from relic to mirror/pool across dreams.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation through dream shards deepens the dominant stake (healing connections) via Kael’s agency; the widow’s dream delivers unmistakable cost when "chest ached" at the lost daughter revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the globe’s reweighted symbolism—final "windows of connection" image answers the central question without moralizing, transforming "bottled sea’s fury" into enduring threads.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("quiet moments between breaths," "frozen reeds") and rhythmic control under pressure; dream sequences modulate syntax to reflect emotional urgency without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("salvaged something pure—not gold or silver, but... threads") with consistent metaphor logic. Final line’s "windows open" recharges motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost-communication via dream-cameos avoids tropes; the melted globe’s mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (mosaic dreams) heightening emotional stakes coherently.</comment>
