<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but closure choice lacks earned causality; epiphany about "courage to swap" told not shown through prior micro-choices. Interiority relies on labels ("heart pounding") without embodied contradiction during pivotal king swap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flawless causal linkage: each swap triggers spire reaction narrowing options. Cost legible in "weight lift" and "steps light despite ice" at closure. Minor pressure dip when whine replaces groaning after bishop swap slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ice spire functions as micro-setting: cracking ice constrains movement, bioluminescent fungi enable swaps. Pocket sundial charges final image ("warmed against skin"). Environmental details lack tactical constraint during chess sequence despite vivid atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (spire collapse) escalate via physical reactions to swaps: ice cracks → violent shaking. Agency clear in Kael's methodical swaps. Cost legible through relief ("weight lift") but "high-pitched whine" after bishop swap adds redundant pressure without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess mechanics: swapping physical pieces to amend magical imbalance embodies "sacredly playful" pursuit. Final image reweights sundial without moralizing. "Apprentice of wonder" label slightly undermines subtlety as thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "ozone and old parchment" smells, compresses diction under stress ("fingers flew"). Minor flaw: "Kael was no ordinary thief" functions as expository interiority explaining shown traits, violating POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "teardrop" pawn description slightly generic but compensated by strong propulsion. Final paragraph shows cost through "weight lift"/"steps light" without telling. One borderline artifact: "otherworldly light" risks purple prose but justified by spire's magic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "chivalrous thief" transformed via magic-system chess mechanics. Risk-taking in making climax a quiet swap, not fight. Emotional specificity in "liquid starlight" fragments avoids trope reliance. Slightly familiar "cloud-city" setting prevents 9.0+.</comment>
