<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "composed rhythm" vs. "logic core flickered" during temporal overload, but the epiphany resolves slightly too tidily without sufficient struggle in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "Thoughts were not born in isolation..." reweights the courtyard's meaning with undeniable cost in the dissolved violin and altered sweeping rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard actively constrains choices (snow muffling sound, ice shaping the violin) and charges the final image where "mundane" sweeping becomes philosophical action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density—holograms, melting ice, temporal collisions—narrows options under accumulative lens, though the scientist's return slightly softens the felt cost of the violin's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the courtyard's transformation; "mysticism of the everyday" conclusion avoids moralizing while resonantly answering the central question through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct robotic perceptual signature ("optical sensors," "processor whirred") modulates perfectly under pressure, though "remarkably composed" risks slight human-label slippage in the POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; "fractal, repeating in layers" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "raw material of thought" edges toward abstraction in one high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Robot janitor trope transformed via specific "amalgamate" mechanics; emotional truth in finding profundity within sweeping elevates beyond surface novelty with risk-taking in quiet closure.</comment>
