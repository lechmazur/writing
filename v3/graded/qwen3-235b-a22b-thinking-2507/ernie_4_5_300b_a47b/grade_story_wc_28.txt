<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cradle empathy in arms of steel" embodied through tessera placement, but "aberrant mercy" as mantra borders on label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably with conceptual cost in "not in spite of its scars, but because of them," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through patterned retrocognition payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mosaic tessera functions as micro-setting constraining choice (finding/fitting the piece) and charging the final ripple image, though sensory detail leans slightly visual-heavy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Escalation driven by Elias’ retrocognitive agency deepens knowledge (artisan’s intent → daughter’s continuation), with scars-as-foundation cost legible in the plaza’s rebirth premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through tessera’s journey from broken relic to "promise of tomorrow," avoiding moralizing while reweighting destruction as transformation in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars burned like fractured glass") and rhythmic control under pressure, though "retrocognitively trapped" risks academic register drift in a high-stress beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero fatal artifacts; "warm coldness" repetition slightly over-ornaments but doesn’t obscure closure. Minor scaffold in "He reached... his fingers brushing" costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mosaic metaphor with "aberrant mercy" transforms post-apocalyptic tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
