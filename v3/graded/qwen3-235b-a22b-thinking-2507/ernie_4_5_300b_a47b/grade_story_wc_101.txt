<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to replace anonymity with naming feels earned through observed patterns and micro-choices (e.g., widow interaction). Slight over-reliance on "gently persistent" label, but redeemed by concrete action like tracing donations through midnight runs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: bell's final transformation into communal voice carries undeniable conceptual cost ("dared to name themselves"). Orientation solid by para 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-break from anonymity to named mosaic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and bell function as indispensable micro-setting: bell's evolution from silent relic to "sang with voices" directly charges closure. Constraints matter—sanctioned gathering place pressures midnight runs and final naming.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust vs anonymity) tightens through Mira's ringing, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost ("Let sanctions break us"). Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens via pattern-break in donation system, altering community tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: final bell image reweights "naming" as resistance without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo—Mira's "who listens" is earned through widow scene's concrete emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("red tiles glowing like embers," "amplified quiet") filters all details. Consistent single POV; stress compression evident in "voice carrying through amplified quiet" during high-pressure declaration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "hope frayed like old rope" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor flaw: "fear won't feed us. Trust will" slightly pat but redeemed by immediate action. Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sanctions narrative through intergenerational lens. "Amplified quiet" transformed from atmospheric detail to communal language avoids cliché. Specifics like spoon clapper and carved initials ground universals without quirk.</comment>
