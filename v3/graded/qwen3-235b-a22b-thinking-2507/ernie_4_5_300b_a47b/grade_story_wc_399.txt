<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "strangely honest" trait remains label-driven despite mask removal. No visible cost to Mara's endurance beyond sweat, undermining earned stakes. Prophet functions as plot device without independent motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with Mara's continued line-walking, but cost remains conceptual ("balance restored") rather than visceral. Orientation succeeds early, yet lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) weakens causality; no tangible price paid for consecration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whisperfield dunes and kinetic parapet constrain choices (pathways rearrange for "worthy"), charging the final image where stones "stand sentinel." Sensory details like "silk veil" and "wind-chime laugh" are purposefully selective, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("preserve the echo") lack concrete escalation; pressure grows through density not agency. Prophet's role feels coincidental ("amplified the signal"), and no tactical cost alters Mara's approach despite "scars and serenity" reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom preservation emerges through "living archives" and "sages' chorus," avoiding direct moralizing. But "the echo is preserved" borders on thematic echo, weakening the non-literal payoff required for 9+ band despite resonant final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "peripheral awareness" and "conjurer clearings" creates consistent lyrical voice. Dialogue carries subtext ("Your honesty is disarming"), though prophet's speech lacks differentiation. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero syntactic loops or scaffold; "veil of woven silk" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "conjurer clearings" (abstract for POV) and "kinetic parapet" (technical term) slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms mystical tropes through "half-masked line walker" and whisperfield mechanics. "Peripheral awareness" as skill (not magic) feels fresh, though "prophet" archetype lacks novelty. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
