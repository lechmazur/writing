<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine (trembling hands vs. steady voice during confrontation), and final shell-withholding choice earns cost through mirrored maternal trembling. Mother's café confession lacks sufficient prior groundwork for full emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("trembling certainty" in final handshake), but enforcer's off-page confession weakens causal chain. Library confrontation tightens options meaningfully despite convenient script-throw resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Whispering shell functions as perfect micro-setting, constraining choices (decryption) and charging the final image ("voice a promise"). Library setting, while vivid, lacks active pressure during chase sequence beyond note discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from note-decoding to confrontation where vulnerability becomes tactical language. Resolution cost feels conceptual rather than visceral due to off-page mob boss arrest, weakening tangible payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through shell's shifting meaning (burden to compass), with final "vast world... ready" reweighting phobias without moralizing. Slight thematic echo in "vulnerability is language" speech risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pages yellowed like old wounds") and stress-modulated syntax excel. Mother's café dialogue loses Lila's idiosyncratic voice, creating subtle convergence at emotional peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("ink blurred by time and tears"), but "vulnerability is power" statement in climax triggers thematic echo penalty. Final line's slight generality prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Brilliant synthesis of phobias as genetic "map of betrayals" feels inevitable. Mob tropes (fedora'd enforcer) slightly dilute freshness, though shell's transformation elevates premise beyond cliché.</comment>
