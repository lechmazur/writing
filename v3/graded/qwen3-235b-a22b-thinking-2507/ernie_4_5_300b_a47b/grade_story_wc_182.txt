<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pride in knowledge vs. need to admit ignorance) act in scene when throat tightens at mirror door description. Kael’s disappearance lacks visible struggle cost; "reluctant hero" tag feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (surrendering pride to proceed), sustained under Accumulative lens. Final symphony swell crystallizes options but "reluctant hero" phrasing slightly overstates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sentient shelves actively constrain choices (spiders test resolve, velvet books demand touch). Botanical diary as micro-setting charges closure via orchid clue and humming key. Environment shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Textural escalation intensifies through sensory density (spiders → ash → velvet books) under Accumulative lens. Cost (pride) legible at mirror door; humming as agency-driven deepening reweights knowledge stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cipher gaps mirroring blind spots; "acknowledge ignorance" door avoids moralizing. Final symphony swell offers resonant answer to "what do we forget?" without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (linguist noticing grooves/spines) with rhythmic control. "Reluctant hero" phrase breaks voice in final line—generic for elite publication despite otherwise superb pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "spine opening to hollow filled with live spiders" as peak-beat specificity. "Carefully resourceful" label slightly over-tells but redeemed by embodied actions like pocketing orchid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "renegotiate" as tactile dialogue with the unknown transforms library tropes. Emotional truth in knowledge pride vs. necessary ignorance avoids safety-middle hedging.</comment>
