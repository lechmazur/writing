<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s calm vs. trembling hands during visions; micro-choices like steadying the lantern reveal hierarchy of values. Cole’s off-page presence weakens status dynamics, slightly undercutting the final renunciation’s causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation fails at 120 words (setting unclear until "subway maintenance tunnel" in para 3), triggering −0.4. Causal lens holds: lantern use → visions → files → resolution. Charged Poise closure lands with felt cost ("she’d been a pawn"), but late orientation caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tunnel actively constrains choices: puddles navigate to compartment, condensation echoes emotional state. Lantern as micro-setting charges the final image—its flame "blazing" as Mara rejects entanglement. Environment shapes tactics (e.g., scanning corroded hinges) and final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency: vision discovery → compartment evidence → Cole’s recorded threat. Cost is visceral ("weight of centuries," "she’d been a fool"), but the "Eliminate" files feel slightly convenient, slightly weakening escalation’s organic pressure under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: lantern as "bridge" then "chain," drought breaking mirroring Mara’s emotional thaw. Final image ("lantern’s light blazing") reweights memory’s weaponized cost without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via embodied struggle, not abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices corrosion patterns, stress fractures. Rhythmic control shifts during visions (fragmented sentences) vs. calm analysis. Minor register drift in "entangled memories" (clinical term amid visceral prose) slightly disrupts voice coherence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax; final paragraph’s short sentences ("But not anymore.") create propulsion. "Watchfully calm" repetition risks cadence monotony early, but high-density phrasing ("beacon in darkness," "chains binding her") avoids overwriting. Figurative language serves pressure, not decoration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes historical injustice (abolitionist lantern) with systemic corruption uniquely. Mara’s occupational specificity—preventable death investigation protocols—transforms "haunted object" trope. Risk-taking (vision sequences) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making Cole’s manipulation feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
