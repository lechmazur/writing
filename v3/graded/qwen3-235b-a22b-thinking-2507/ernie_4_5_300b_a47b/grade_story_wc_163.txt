<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "impractical" work vs deep belief, embodied through feather ritual. Micro-choices under pressure (inviting skeptics, shared exhale) reveal hierarchy of values. Researchers lack depth as secondary characters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mara's realization that "belonging was not a destination but a journey" crystallizes options with felt cost (vulnerability in sharing her ritual). Accumulative lens holds through luminous respite's crescendo and fade.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Underwater city actively constrains choices—bioluminescence replaces starlight, pressure shapes observation. Feather functions as micro-setting charging the final image ("tracing edges... sunlight filtered down"). No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (validation of Mara's belief in underwater rhythms) tightens through researchers' skepticism until alignment proves her right. Agency entirely Mara's; cost is her emotional exposure. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: feather's journey from surface relic to talisman reframes "belonging." Final line ("rhythm worth dancing to") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gentle hand against glass," "fireflies of summer" reflect Mara's astrologer lens. Rhythmic compression during alignment ("breath fogging the glass") heightens pressure. Zero POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "shadowseam wonder" earns abstraction through concrete setup. Sentence rhythm varies organically ("She studied... mapping constellations"). One minor register drift: "softly ingenious" feels detached from POV.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms underwater tropes via specific synthesis: landscape astrologer observing bioluminescent constellations. Emotional truth in quiet triumph avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens stakes without obscurity.</comment>
