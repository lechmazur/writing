<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) drive micro-choices under pressure, but Vey’s underdeveloped motivation and "repulsive allure" label slightly undermine embodied emotion in pivotal confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes distrust of Vey with felt cost ("The one that survives"), but the conceptual price lacks explicit legibility—ambiguity works yet falls short of undeniable cost proof at the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Funhouse mirrors and cloak clasp constrain choices (distorted reflections force closed eyes) and charge closure (clasp’s golden pulse), meeting 9+ gate by reweighting the carnival’s "mouth" metaphor through visceral, tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating distortions (shifting shadow, moths) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but Vey’s ambiguous cost isn’t dramatized—felt consequence lingers without on-page payment, weakening final stakes legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("feed it a lie"), avoiding moralizing; Vey’s final line reweights "fear is a lie" non-literally, offering resonant ambiguity that lingers without confusion or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes like fractured glass," condensation-slick mirrors) modulates rhythm under stress; no POV slippage, with syntax tightening during confrontation ("She scoffed. 'A lie? How?'").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor density slip ("repulsive allure" label) in high-pressure beat, but zero loops/scaffold; propulsion remains clean with vivid specificity ("sticky with age, ink faded to ghostly blue") until closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival trope through psychological stakes ("feed it a lie" paradox); risk-taking in Vey’s ambiguous ending transforms fear’s mechanics without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
