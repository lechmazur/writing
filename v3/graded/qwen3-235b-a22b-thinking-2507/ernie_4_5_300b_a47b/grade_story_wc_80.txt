<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("masking sensitivity beneath pragmatism") and embodied emotion ("thoughts roared") anchor choices; final note placement earns closure through causal chain from grandmother's inkwell to chamber discovery, though reflection near midpoint risks slight BRR overreach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("inkwell felt lighter" signaling emotional release); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in chamber discovery, reweighting "interlaced absence" with undeniable pressure at the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submerged pavilion actively constrains choices (silt-slowed wading, dome enabling note placement); inkwell functions as micro-setting charging closure ("dotted with ink stains" proving connection), avoiding postcard description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency (wresting hatch open) deepens the dominant stake (validating grandmother's stories) with conceptual cost; chamber discovery reweights options under Accumulative lens, though tension slightly softens post-reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("abandoned dreams... not lost—just waiting to be surveyed") offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question; theme emerges through inkwell's evolving use and chamber discovery without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via surveyor's professional noticing ("fissure in the stone," "erosion"); voice modulates rhythm from reflective ("sunlight once danced") to tense ("Heart racing") without POV leakage, though "thoughts roared" borders cliché.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "arches cradling murky water where sunlight once danced" exemplifies high-density propulsion; only minor register drift in "stoically sensitive gaze" saved by context, no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveyor/archaeologist roles transforms "abandoned dreams" trope; specificity of inkwell mechanics and pavilion's physical logic creates emotional truth, though "hushed blaze" slightly echoes common lyric phrasing.</comment>
