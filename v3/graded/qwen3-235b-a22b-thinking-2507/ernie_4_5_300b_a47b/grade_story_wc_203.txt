<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' dual role as technician and ghost-listener, with embodied emotion ("weightless burden pressing against his chest like a second skin"). Final choice to "repair stories" earned by dust-pattern micro-choices, though flaw integration lacks visible struggle beyond observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with ghosts fading and fluorescent buzz returning, reconfiguring the ticket office's loneliness. Cost ("chest tight with weightless burden") is felt but lacks concrete anchoring; a single added detail (e.g., trembling hands on the mainspring barrel) would make cost undeniable per 9+ test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned circus ticket office functions as micro-setting: peeling laminate, dust patterns, and plaster cracks actively constrain choices (climbing counter, revealing compartment). The mainspring barrel charges the final image—its soft whirring against ghostly departure—fulfilling the 9+ gate by charging closure through a recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias' agency under Accumulative lens—dust analysis leads to ceiling investigation—narrowing options to confronting hidden truths. Cost ("legs shaking," "chest tight") is legible but could deepen the physical toll of ghostly weight; the single tightening suffices yet lacks visceral trade-off beyond emotional burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Elias repairing "stories hidden in cracks," with the final image ("ticket office felt a little less lonely") offering resonant, non-literal resolution. Avoids moralizing; the child's smudged photograph and canceled tickets reweight grief without abstraction, though "repair the elevator/repair stories" parallel risks slight neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias' "skillfully observant" noticing (dust swirls, light fractures) creates rhythmic control under pressure. Prose modulates from clinical precision ("horologist’s mainspring barrel") to lyrical resonance ("voice a rustle of leaves"), with all elision (ghost whispers) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("plunging the ticket office into dim, blue-gray haze"), but paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "skillfully observant" repeats identically, and "weightless burden" appears twice without deepening. Final line’s "less lonely" avoids sentimentality yet slightly over-tells; subtle image shift would heighten charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repair technician and ghost-listener through occupational specificity (dust-pattern forensics, mainspring barrel). Abandoned circus trope transformed by emotional stakes—ghosts as "unspoken grief"—with the elevator’s physical/emotional dual repair creating inevitable, non-obvious resonance in hindsight.</comment>
