<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (duty vs curiosity) drive the rope switch and rhythm creation, with humility resisting praise while embracing responsibility. Cost is felt in her aching arms and the weight of ongoing vigilance, though Veyra remains functional rather than fully dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: clouds calm but solstice hush now carries "new resonance," with cost in Lira’s physical exhaustion and acceptance of perpetual duty. Causal lens holds firmly from glue test to rope switch to storm response, anchored by the sundial’s shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bell rope functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (glue stiffness forces secondary rope use) and charging closure when Lira leans against it, its "rough but familiar" texture embodying earned harmony. Sanctuary actively pressures decisions via "thick air" and cloud dynamics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: bell tone must pierce air to prevent chaos. Escalation via rope switch narrows options (only one method works), with cost in Lira’s realization she "agitated the storms" and must now actively maintain balance through rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "favoring listening over noise" reweights from technical tactic to philosophical stance. Final image of "winds now allies" offers resonant answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite Veyra’s "maestro" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("clouds churned in fractal patterns," "sundial’s shadow creeping"), with syntax tightening under pressure. Dialogue lacks distinctive cadence—Veyra’s lines feel functional rather than voice-particular, slightly blurring status dynamics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No scaffold or loops, but "credibly curious" drifts toward label-speak and "fractal patterns" slightly overwrites. Final line’s repetition ("listening, always listening") earns lyricism through concrete prior action, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms weather-control trope via specific mechanics (bell resonance altering microclimates). "Switch" reframes humility as active listening, avoiding safety middle by making harmony precarious rather than permanent. Freshness anchored in tactile bell physics.</comment>
