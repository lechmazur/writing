<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied conflict shines (throat tightening, vision blurring), but the pilgrim lacks interior contradiction—archetypal wisdom without vulnerability. Micro-choice closing the pearl is earned; secondary character pressure feels functional, not transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Elara accepts uncontrollable forces with visceral cost ("throat tighten[ing]"). Pilgrim’s dissolution risks coincidence, but the reconfigured cave song with "unpredictable hum" proves conceptual cost legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cave constrains every choice—the pearl’s warmth triggers shattering crystals, light dimming alters tactics. Final image ("unpredictable hum beneath the melody") charges closure through setting’s evolution, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake (control vs. chaos) tightens meaningfully when pearl contact fractures the song. Agency in Elara’s choice to hold it forecloses "magnifying" purity, but escalation lacks a second pressure point; cost is felt but not actively paid beyond perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cave’s duality—"brightness and darkness are twins"—without moralizing. Final image of changed song reweights the premise: acceptance of unpredictability as the resonant answer, no tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s sensory POV ("crystals sang a minor key, vibration humming in bones") is distinct, but pilgrim’s dialogue slips into thematic echo ("unseen forces are fickle..."). Perceptual signature strong under pressure; minor register drift in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "shards swirling like glitter in a storm" exemplifies textural density. Slight scaffold in setup ("Elara had made it her home... drawn by promise") deducts—redundant to later magic demonstration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "wise stranger" trope via overlapping shadows mechanic and cave pearl’s tangible physics. Emotional truth in clairvoyant’s vulnerability elevates genre; risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
