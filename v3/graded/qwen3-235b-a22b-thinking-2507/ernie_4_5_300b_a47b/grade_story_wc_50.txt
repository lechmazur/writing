<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's skepticism about "reason's cellar" versus his meticulous work. Micro-choices with the mirror reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Keeper's off-page presence limits relationship dynamics despite thematic friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: timer's hum fading while vials store echoes crystallizes conceptual cost of wonder preservation. Accumulative lens holds through light-study progression. Cost legibility slightly softened by absence of physical consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern actively constrains choices—quartz veins guide gear alignment via light angles. "Cavern’s vibrations shifting with earth tides" charges final image. Environment transcends atmosphere to dictate tactics at every turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (storing wonder) tightens through Elias's light studies narrowing options. Agency clear in daily observations, but keeper's off-page pressure lacks dramatized friction. Cost ("wounded season ending") visible yet slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: keeper's "bottled wonder" quote versus Elias's warping reflection in humming light. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "cellar of reason" as both grave and vessel without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable—"peripherally focused" shapes all description (e.g., "gears scattered like dead leaves"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax: "chorus of voices... sustained note." Minor register drift in "peripherally focused by nature."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "quartz veins began to glow, their light pulsing" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight scaffold in "he worked methodically... tools laid out." Mixed metaphor ("earth healing silent wound") costs 0.2 without touching closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "fixing device" trope via acoustic premise and light-study mechanic. "Wounded season" concept feels fresh, though "cellar of reason" risks cliché. Synthesis of wonder preservation with locksmith craft achieves emotional specificity.</comment>
