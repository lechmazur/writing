<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("affectionate skeptic") manifest through embodied somatic markers and geode interaction; final choice to reject recall earns closure with visible cost in Mara's mirrored hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "fractally, somatically, undeniably real" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (rejecting corporate solutions), under Accumulative lens with persistent constraint (somatic markers).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (geode) constrains choice—Elias maps markers through its facets—and charges final image ("geode warm against his palm"), meeting 9+ gate for tool-driven closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (authentic awareness vs. corporate shortcuts) tightens through Elias's deepening somatic work; agency-driven escalation narrows options to his method with visible cost (refusing refunds).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete contrast ("fractally precise" crystals vs. pills' "imprecise" noise); final image reweights premise without moralizing, satisfying quick test via non-literal resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("static’s aftereffects," "willowglass hope") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in breakthrough scene ("geode flared... sense of alignment") avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "somatic markers like breadcrumbs" compresses transit without scaffold; minor density in "neural map" phrasing avoids peak-beat muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tech-skeptic trope via somatic specificity; "telepathy pill" subversion as "awareness" feels inevitable. Lacks risk distinction bonus for structural boldness.</comment>
