<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradiction (seeking truth while distrusting anecdotes) drives choices, but Tomas lacks interiority; "noble lies" label risks diagnostic-speak yet avoids epiphany clichés through concrete negotiation artifacts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed"), but Tomas’s sudden appearance violates "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-choked archway actively constrains choice (revealing tunnel), while the rosebush’s death charges the final image—environment directly shapes tactics and closure’s thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recapturing truth before petal drop) tightens via the tunnel’s map, but Tomas’s exposition risks passive resolution; cost is conceptual (truth’s fragility) yet unmistakable in the *T*’s inscription.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through negotiation symbols (rose/key/chain) reweighted as "collaboration," avoiding moralizing; final line ("gardeners of memory") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "noble lies" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in historian’s artifact-focused noticing ("serif curves," "faint lines"); rhythmic control deepens under pressure with purposeful elision (e.g., "symbols scratched into the walls" compressing discovery).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "crumbling pamphlet" and "faint lines" multitask. Figurative language ("brickwork softened into greenish folds") serves atmosphere without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "noble lies" trope through concrete negotiation artifacts (broken chain = truce); emotional specificity in Elara’s shift from recapturing to "recontextualizing" truth feels earned, not template-driven.</comment>
