<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (truth vs. elegance) embodied in puppet mechanics, but tycoon backstory summary slightly tells rather than dramatizes the moral compromise that fuels current stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elias's realization ("ethical story wasn't a tidy package") crystallizes options with visible cost from earlier "serifed verses smooth as lies," holding Accumulative lens through atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Radar dome's skeletal ribs actively fracture light for projections, while story stick (micro-setting) charges final image—environment constrains choice and closure with no ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when drifter scoffs ("making excuses for half-truths"), forcing Elias's reversal—a protagonist-driven escalation that reweights ethical cost through visible agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through reversed puppets ("let's make the shadows dance"), avoiding moralizing; final campfire image reweights "half-truths" with conceptual cost without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink-stained fingers," "serifed verses") modulates rhythm under pressure, though slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing briefly jars voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "meteor hush" reappears with reweighted meaning. One hairline slip: "serifed verses smooth as lies" tells rather than shows the compromise in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ethical storytelling through puppetry mechanics—tropes transformed by calligrapher-turned-puppeteer specificity and bold stance on half-truths' necessity, avoiding safety-hedging.</comment>
