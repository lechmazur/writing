<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "gently meticulous nature felt like a curse" under pressure, but emotional layering lacks depth during peak stress; micro-choices like fist-slam show embodied cost yet internal conflict remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: dawn's light "refreshing" illusions crystallizes the cost of temporary reprieve. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through frequency sampling, with causal ellipsis in the library's magic flare proving functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice prism tool constrains choice (focusing light) and charges the final image ("warmth seeping in"). Sensory specificity like "quartz hush" and frost-rattled panes mirrors Elara's precise struggle, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: sampling frequencies narrows options as vows fade. Cost is unmistakable in "exhaustion melting away" after temporary victory, though the dawn resolution slightly edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "vows as light frequencies" reweighted by dawn's arrival—no moralizing, just the resonant image of "colors brightening as if refreshed." Avoids thematic echo while answering the central question of preserving meaning through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("handwriting as precise as her thoughts") and rhythmic control under pressure excel. Minor deduction for one filter verb ("Elara ignored it") during high-stakes sampling, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "quartz hush settling" shows textural specificity. Near-flawless propulsion until "frustration gnawed at her" (slightly generic) in peak stress, but redeemed by immediate concrete action (fist-slam).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "vows as physics" transforms fantasy tropes. Emotional truth in Elara's quiet victory avoids sentimentality, though risk-taking stays within safe boundaries—dawn resolution lacks deeper complication.</comment>
