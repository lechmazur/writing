<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (floating vs. grounded desire), but emotional embodiment lacks specificity in pivotal choices; "heart heavy with weight of possibility" abstracts rather than concretizes cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (surrendering power for peace), but Accumulative escalation lacks sufficient pressure tightening; timeline shifts feel observational rather than driven by Mara’s agency under duress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Viaduct’s "darkening brightness" evolves from spectral backdrop to final image charging closure; rain-slick stones constrain movement subtly, though environmental pressure on choices remains underdeveloped beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-acceptance) tightens through timeline confrontations, but escalation relies on accumulative reflection rather than causal trade-offs; cost (loss of power) feels earned yet insufficiently visceral at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through fractured selves without moralizing; final grounded walk reweights "labyrinth" metaphor with resonant ambiguity, avoiding tidy resolution while honoring complexity of identity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV voice maintains lyrical consistency ("spectral light," "procedural generation"), but "darkening brightness" strains as repeated abstract motif; stress-induced compression lacks character-specific syntactic degradation during high-pressure timeline shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves textural density with purposeful rhythm ("rain pattered against cobblestones"), yet paraphrase loops in timeline descriptions ("some happy, some broken") dilute momentum near closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "fractured timeline" trope through gravity-defiance as emotional metaphor; specificity of clay tablet’s dissolution grounds abstract theme, though risk-taking avoids true structural innovation beyond genre conventions.</comment>
