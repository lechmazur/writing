<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "silence as violence" metaphor and ink-stained precision, but bear resolution slightly unearths motivation; micro-choice to touch quartz reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost in "faintest imprint in the moss".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence between beats, where dreams breathe" reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost in "first true smile in years"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the forecourt's song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (gentle touch triggers bear's purr) and charges final image; petrichor evolves from intrusion to hope, with "moss-patched flagstones" embodying lived-in specificity that shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via "shackled to ticking hands"; escalation through sensory deepening (growl → song → touch) reweights silence with cost in "years" of abandoned dream, though bear's arrival edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "silence as violence" and petrichor's transformation; final image reweights silence without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while charging "glacial hush" with conceptual cost of eroded time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("petrichor, earthy tang of rain-soaked stone") and rhythmic compression under stress ("Lira froze") shine; minor register drift in "dream had never been abandoned—only paused" slightly dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("moss-patched flagstones" conveys texture and constraint), but "thrummed with memory of sound—the ghost of wind chimes" borders on overwriting; final image pristine with no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockmaker precision with wildness via "language of resonance"; bear avoids cliché by harmonizing with stone, though crystal forecourt risks familiar magical realism tropes despite specific execution.</comment>
