<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines in "seasonally mute lips curved into a faint smile," showing rather than telling her fulfillment. Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure—Elara's commitment never wavers, missing the micro-conflict needed for 9+ despite vivid sensory choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when "the final droplet fell" and Elara strikes the bell, reconfiguring meaning with conceptual cost. Orientation penalty applies: "who/where/when" clarity delayed past 120 words ("seasonally mute voice" in para 2), costing 0.4 under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Obsidian pedestal and bells function as micro-setting, constraining her placement of the ice fragment. But the bluff remains postcard backdrop—not pressuring choices—failing the 9+ gate despite lyrical specificity like "mossy steps carved into the stone."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) signaled early but never viscerally tested; iceberg melting creates passive time pressure without narrowing Elara's options. Cost is felt ("sculpture shuddered, then stilled") but lacks agency-driven trade-offs under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sculpture's creation, avoiding moralizing until the final paragraph's "testament to symphonies of truth" risks thematic echo. Resonant closure in "color of wonder... something to be released" reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("air shimmered with secrets only the wind could interpret"), with rhythmic control intensifying during the symphony's climax. Capped at 7.8 due to Q2 orientation penalty, though voice modulation under pressure is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Template cadence in the final line—"like the ringing of a bell, like the glisten of ice, like the whisper"—triggers -0.5 for three identical stems in a high-pressure beat, disallowing 9+ globally. Otherwise, lyrical density serves momentum until this artifact dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of muteness-as-artistry transforms a familiar trope, with kinetic sculpture mechanics grounding the ethereal premise. Avoids safety-middle through specific glacial-water chimes, but emotional complexity lacks the non-obvious moral calculus needed for 9+.</comment>
