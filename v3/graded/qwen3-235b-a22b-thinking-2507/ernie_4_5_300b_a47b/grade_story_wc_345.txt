<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s altruism drives consistent action but lacks contradictory impulses in scene; her reexamination hints at doubt yet remains untested under pressure. Motives are clear but interiority leans slightly tell-y ("transparent motives") without deeper flaw manifestation. Closure choice earned via prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Charged Poise: the mended arch’s "cracks" and nebula’s flare reconfigure hope’s fragility with palpable cost. Accumulative lens holds through message escalation; settlers’ mobilization narrows options organically. Orientation anchors instantly ("orchard planet of Luminara").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The watering bell functions as micro-setting—constraining choices when suspended on the arch and charging the final image. Sensory details ("breath visible in the chill air") filter through Elara’s ethereal perspective. Environment shapes tactics via twilight timing and orchard resources.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through settlers’ shift from skepticism to action, with tangible cost in physical labor and emotional vulnerability. Agency manifests via collective choice, not luck; the arch’s mended cracks embody irreversible change. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "hope was not a solitary pursuit—it was a garden." Final image reweights the bell’s symbolism without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via "brambled hope" and visible struggle ("hands steady, hearts united").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shimmer in the air," "brambled hope") and rhythmic control during climax ("rope and pulleys... banners of hope"). Voice modulates from lyrical dawn messages to urgent gathering. Zero head-hopping; focalization stays anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flickering like a candle flame" is borderline cliché but redeemed by context. Final line’s chime delivers crystalline closure. Propulsion via active verbs ("mobilize," "chanted") without figurative muddle. Paragraph cuts heighten tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: altruistic ghost as ecosystem guardian, "brambled hope" as tangible tone. Transforms tropes via specific mechanics (chalk messages, bell symbolism). Risk-taking in quiet resolution feels earned through prior particulars. Avoids abstraction with "pearl-fruited trees."</comment>
