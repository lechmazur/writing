<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (doubting clocks while maintaining them) and embodied emotion ("fjord’s quiet made his eyes water"), but motivation for understanding clocks remains abstract without tangible stakes. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond realization, missing Earned Stasis requirements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "clocks measured longing" reweights premise with undeniable emotional cost ("ache to hold onto moments"). Orientation is perfect within 120 words, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout the counting ritual’s cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fjord functions as micro-setting that charges the ending (water parting, key vibrating), but occupational details of hydraulic clocks lack tactical constraint—pressure stems from theme, not mechanics. Misses 9+ gate by not concretely shaping Lorn’s final choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time’s nature) deepens via counting ritual, but escalation lacks visible price altering tactics. Revelation feels passive—no trade-off or cost until the final realization, failing the "altered tactics" requirement for high-band scores.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: key’s constellations and counting ritual culminate in "longing" without moralizing. Final image reweights everything through the seabed clock’s dissolution, avoiding thematic echo while making cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water so calm it mirrored the moon like a second sky") and rhythmic control shine, but "eminent peculiar" diction slightly clashes with Lorn’s blue-collar role. Compression in counting ritual is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless prose with vivid specificity, but triplet structure ("weight of silence, thickness of twilight, tremble of anticipation") creates subtle rhythm loop. No artifacts in peak beats; final image’s lyrical density avoids muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms "time measurement" trope through hydraulic/fjord imagery and "longing" insight. Risk-taking (counting ritual as escalation) heightens stakes coherently, with emotional specificity ("fear of letting them go") avoiding generic abstraction.</comment>
