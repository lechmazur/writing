<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's motivation ("assure vulnerable voices") is clear and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses; her compassion remains unchallenged, missing the 9+ requirement for simultaneous conflicting drives during pressure. The brief interaction with the widow shows embodied emotion ("fingers trembled") but insufficient status dynamics for meaningful relationship escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "throat tightened" and "single tear" crystallize emotional stakes, while the silent hearing aid reweights the atrium's purpose. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density ("mist parted," "pulse synchronized"), though the transition to the widow's appearance lacks causal setup, narrowly avoiding the orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hearing aid and mist function as micro-setting: the device's mechanics drive the pulse-tracking method, and the final image of its "silent" state charges closure by embodying earned peace. Sensory details ("damp moss," "cobwebs") filter through Lila's professional urgency, avoiding tourist cataloging while constraining her choices in the labyrinth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when the hearing aid pulses synchronize, narrowing Lila's path to delivering the message. But escalation relies on environmental discovery (finding the second device) rather than protagonist agency under pressure; the "reeling hush" moment lacks tangible cost beyond emotional weight, missing the 8.8+ requirement for visible price altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the photograph's evolving meaning and the final line "stories... meant to echo," avoiding moralizing. The core concept ("incidental heroism") reweights the premise via Lila's action—not abstraction—but the widow's tear slightly oversimplifies grief's complexity, preventing a 9.0+ conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "mist curling like spectral cats" and professional focus ("persistently curious mind"), but filter verbs ("she noticed," "she felt") dilute immediacy during high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively from clinical ("trace hearts") to lyrical ("bruised violet"), though stress syntax lacks variation in the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density in "faint, irregular, like a heartbeat trapped in amber" showcases rhythmic control, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("pulse grew louder, a rhythmic thrum that matched her own racing heart") trigger a −0.2 deduction. Closure beat remains artifact-free, though "reeling hush" risks thematic echo without sufficient concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the "ghost communicator" trope through specific mechanics (hearing aid physics) and emotional restraint; the atrium's role as a "place where the dead called" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (textural lens for closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the widow's archetype slightly limits perspective freshness.</comment>
