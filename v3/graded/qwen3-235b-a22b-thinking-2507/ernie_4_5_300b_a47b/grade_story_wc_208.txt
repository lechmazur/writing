<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority strong via driftwood sculptures as embodied motivation, but "perpetually learning brain raced" slips into diagnostic label-speak. Contradictory impulses (fear vs curiosity) surface weakly during portal transition; micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs under pressure despite clear "scaffold complexity" drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (complexity as tapestry), but grandmother encounter resolves via coincidence not agency. Orientation clear by word 100 ("storm-tossed archway loomed"), yet lens (Accumulative/Textural) weakens when time-weaving feels unearned rather than deepening pressure through causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archway and driftwood sculptures function as micro-setting that constrains choices (back against moss, sculptures as maps) and charges the final image. "Crab with clockwork heart" specificity avoids white-room syndrome, though "bruised sky" slightly over-relies on visual cliché without deeper sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering island's history) tightens when Lira steps through the portal, but escalation lacks visceral cost—complexity becoming "burden" remains abstract. Agency in pressing the slide drives change, yet the conceptual price isn't legible in the final image beyond intellectual realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sculptures-as-maps without moralizing, but "scaffold complexity with simplicity" borders on thematic echo. Final image reweights the premise via mermaid's kelp timeline, though "tapestry" metaphor slightly over-explains rather than letting driftwood details resonate silently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tasting like salt and iron") and rhythmic control shine, but "turbine-hum reverie" feels overwrought in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively with stress, though "perpetually learning brain" momentarily drifts from Lira’s sculptor lexicon into clinical abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "kelp hair/clockwork heart" specificity drives momentum. Minor density issue in "clutching her driftwood sculptures... all carved from debris" (redundant description), but rhythm varies naturally and closure image remains sharp without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via driftwood sculptor lens: crab’s clockwork heart embodies tidal mechanics uniquely. Emotional truth in "child’s laughter echoing through time" avoids generic templates, though "timewoven alliances" phrase leans slightly derivative without sufficient lived-in detail.</comment>
