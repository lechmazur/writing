<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines in "throat tightened" and "dice trembled," but drone confrontation lacks sufficient motivation depth—calm defiance feels slightly unearned without prior stakes escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with "laboratory sank deeper" crystallizing cost; orientation anchors by line 3, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through dance-driven escalation to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sunken lab actively constrains choices (drones descending from ceiling, water pooling), and hangman’s dice charge the closure—but "concrete bones" verges on generic, narrowly missing 9.0 environmental integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally through hologram hum to strobing alarms, but drone resolution relies slightly on scientist’s precedent without Kael’s agency fully driving the escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "vulnerability as strength" to the final spider-web metaphor; no moralizing, with "dancers long gone but never silent" reweighting the premise through charged specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "lyrical code breaker" noticing ivory dice amid clutter; rhythmic control peaks in dance sequences, though stress compression could deepen during drone confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops and vivid propulsion, but "water dripped... pooling" creates a minor simultaneity error; no figurative muddle, though "threads spun from the same silk" slightly over-ornaments a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dance as decryption method transforms tropes, but "calm defiance" resolution echoes familiar underdog tropes without sufficient unique stakes—risk-taking elevates yet lacks transformative novelty for 9.0.</comment>
