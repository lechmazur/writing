<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: scavenger of stories yet seeking redemption through jars of silence. Final choice to "capture more sounds tomorrow" is earned by his tears hearing his mother’s lullaby. Minor telliness in "he’d always been a bridge" slightly dilutes embodied stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"found his purpose: not to be remembered, but to remember"—with visible cost in "jars of silence" he must keep filling. Accumulative lens holds as sound density reweights stakes; orientation anchors by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Music box (recurring object) constrains choice—pouring sounds into its keyhole—and charges closure as "humming in his hands." Sensory detail woven into action: "boots crunching sand" and "tinny melody spilled out" deepen immersion without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: each jar poured tightens the stake of preserving lost voices. Cost unmistakable in "tears pricking his eyes" and the lifelong burden implied by "jars of silence," reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—"sweeten silence" in the trimmed poem—not moralizing. Final line reweights "remembering" as active labor, avoiding platitude while resonating with the music box’s hum. No thematic echo in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "mother-of-pearl glimmer" and "lonesome splendor." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short sentences during the lullaby moment ("For a heartbeat, nothing happened")—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion: "poured the sound into the music box’s rusted keyhole" does triple duty. Minor scaffold in "He’d spent weeks..." but strategic telling; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: transforming sound capture into "gleaned redemption" via jars and music box. Emotional specificity in "the dead speak loud enough to wake the living" avoids generic templates while committing fully to its premise.</comment>
