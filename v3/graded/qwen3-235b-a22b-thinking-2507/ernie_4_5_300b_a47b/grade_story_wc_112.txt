<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Veyra's interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("curiosity") remains abstract despite embodied stress. No visible trade-off when recalibrating—competence overshadows struggle, weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "she reached for the lever again" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visible cost (sweat, exhaustion). Causal lens holds—each action (pulling lever → destabilization → recalibration) narrows options under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thermal gauntlets' "mechanically warm precision" constrains Veyra's action (clicking joints) and charges the final image ("icy warmth seeped into her bones"). Micro-setting (tool) shapes tactics and closure without static exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Veyra's agency—recalibration forecloses failure with felt cost (sweat, thrashing creatures). But director's late appearance introduces coincidental pressure, slightly undercutting pure causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: time's "spiral" proven via flora's slow-motion unfurling. Final image reweights "icy warmth" as charged curiosity without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Veyra's perceptual signature shines ("breath fogging the visor," "stomach dropped"). But uniform tics in stress ("hands flew," "mind racing") slightly flatten voice during crisis, missing character-specific degradation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but "skeletal frame bathed in muted lavender glow" overwrites in high-pressure beat. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet lyrical excess in setup slightly slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" transforms time-bending tropes via specific xenobiology stakes. Risk-taking (lyric tension in crisis) heightens coherence, though "mechanically warm" leans toward ornamental without deeper integration.</comment>
