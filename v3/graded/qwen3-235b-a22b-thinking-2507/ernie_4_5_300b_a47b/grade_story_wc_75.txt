<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between preservation urgency and quiet hope is embodied through dough kneading and lens handling; "rosewater dread" phrasing slightly abstracts emotion but "beekeeper's absence lingered" grounds the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes displacement/renewal stakes with visible cost (beekeeper's absence) under Accumulative lens; "oven's heat filled the grotto" deepens the dominant stake through sensory density shift without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (emerald lens) charges the final image as beacon; dough's warmth constrains choice against cavern dampness, making environment a tactical element when children "smear flour" on faces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lila's shift from narration to baking/singing, but escalation leans environmental (thaw's trickle) rather than protagonist-driven agency; cost (beekeeper's absence) is felt but not actively chosen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread initials and lens reflection without moralizing; "art like bread requires patience" avoids sentimentality by anchoring in dough texture, though "rosewater dread" over-signals the central tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in museum-guide precision ("moss-carved arches") and tactile baking details; tense shifts in "Lila’s mind raced" disrupt POV modesty but final loaf imagery recovers rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero closure-dulling artifacts; "thaw had begun" / "spring’s trickle" creates minor paraphrase loop but "dough’s warmth seeped into her hands" delivers high-density propulsion with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms refugee-artist trope through specific rituals (initial-shaped bread); emotional freshness in "off-key songs" and flour-smeared faces avoids generic revival narratives while maintaining conceptual integrity.</comment>
