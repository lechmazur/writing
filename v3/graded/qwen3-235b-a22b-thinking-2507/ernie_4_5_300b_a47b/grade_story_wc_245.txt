<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (grief/hope coiling) manifests in micro-choices like humming the lullaby while digging; embodied emotion avoids labels via ring vibrations and silt sensations. Final choice earned through map discovery’s tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: stillpoint crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "memory made flesh" revelation. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via ultrasonic cues to reweight time/stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest (9G) constrains every choice: river’s silt dictates digging, frequencies guide path. Final image charged by "time pooled like liquid" directly enabling the mother’s vibration-voice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency—wading the Silver Vein to "dig" narrows options. Cost legible in the map’s "trembling" and lifelong quest resolution, though emotional price could deepen marginally at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "feeling becomes seeing" reweights navigation/emotion via stillpoint’s physicality. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in mother-as-memory without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "ring thrummed against his thumb" filters world through vibration. Rhythmic control under pressure ("humming under breath" to silt plunge) with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "language of growth and decay" exemplifies high-density prose. Final image’s "vibration against his skin" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes ultrasonic ecology with emotional cartography into fresh premise. Risk-taking (time-as-mercury) heightens stakes coherently; "stillpoint" transforms cliché through tactile specificity.</comment>
