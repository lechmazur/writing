<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's embodied struggle ("fingers bled," "dreamed of prism whole") grounds motivation in concrete micro-choices. Contradictory impulses (stubborn hope vs. despair when shard remains cold) intensify organically to earned closure. Slight underdevelopment of "stubborn hope" motivation early prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable conceptual cost: "Elara never saw the stars fully return... But she didn’t need to." Causal escalation ("slammed the shard" → light eruption) holds cleanly. Storm sequence creates meaningful tightening; "seventh night" timing slightly convenient but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Glass pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (wind howls during alignment) and charges closure ("shards of hush turned to hope"). Mosaic floor actively shapes tactics. "Skeletal wind chimes" metaphor risks cliché but gains specificity through retrocognitive context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prove coincidences have meaning") escalates through failed attempts to storm climax. Cost is visceral (bloodied fingers) and conceptual (enduring the void). Agency drives resolution—her adjustment causes the hum—but early stakes could feel more urgent to reach 9.3+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shards" reweighting: from "fractured ice" to "shards of hush turned to hope." Final image ("universe’s way of whispering") risks prompt-like language but avoids moralizing by rooting in action. Lacks one more layer of complexity for 9.2+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: retrocognition shapes sensory details ("ghostly vibrations of stars"). Syntax tightens under stress ("Dust shivered off the walls"). "Fragile alchemy of hope" shows rhythmic control. Early "stubborn hope" slightly generic prevents 9.4.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes" ties setting/theme). Final line variation ("But she didn’t need to.") creates propulsion. "Skeletal wind chimes" slightly mixed metaphor (bones don’t chime) prevents 9.5, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via permanent void and custodianship-as-continuity. Emotional truth in quiet endurance ("she didn’t need to"). "Prism’s light was never meant to guide ships" subverts expectation brilliantly. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
