<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but final choice lacks prior tension. "Sensitively perceptive" remains label-only without embodied tradeoffs during high-stakes discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: vibration through bones makes conceptual cost visceral. Accumulative lens holds as fragmented symbols coalesce into axis shift with irreversible emotional burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silo walls actively constrain choice (railroad spikes securing tapestry) and charge closure (vibrations of secrets). "Bronze quiet" arrives too late to fully charge final image despite atmospheric strength.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' realization that ignoring stories caused the axis shift. His choice to speak bears visible cost—shoulders trembling as stories rise—driven entirely by his agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: burning diaries embeds stories in walls, dragons flee indifference. Final image reweights "stories don't die" without moralizing, though "began to rise" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pages curled like dying leaves," scales as "tiny letters") modulates perfectly with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in discovery sequence; zero POV drift despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or revelation. "Sensitively perceptive gaze" is lone minor artifact—elevated diction slightly clashes with historian's embodied actions during high-pressure probing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse trope through specific mechanics: stories literally embedded in steel via smoke. Risk-taking with quiet closure pays off through tactile vibration, though "bronze quiet" phrasing lacks earlier groundwork.</comment>
