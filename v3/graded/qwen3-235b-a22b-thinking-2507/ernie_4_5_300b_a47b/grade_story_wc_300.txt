<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: Elias’s duty-bound inspection clashes with emerging empathy as confessions surge. Micro-choice placing the pearl despite hesitation reveals hierarchy of values. No label-speak; regret manifests as "ache of unspoken truths," not abstraction. Lacks one visible flaw-complicated prior choice to hit 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: caves transform from tomb to cathedral with conceptual cost (pearl’s dissolution, purpose shift). Accumulative lens holds—density builds via confessions’ emotional resonance, reweighting stakes through cadence shifts ("walls shimmered, translucent"). Cost legible in "light lingered in his eyes," a quiet promise of irrevocable change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal lattice constrains every choice: hum guides movement, obsidian shards crunch under boots, spiral core demands pearl placement. Final image ("crown piercing darkness") charges closure by reweighting "bunker" as cathedral. Sensory details reflect urgency—calm precision during inspection narrows to visceral "veins of quartz throbbing" under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (connecting abandoned hopes) tightens through Elias’s agency: placing the pearl narrows options (dissolving relic for connection). Cost is conceptual—pearl vanishes but "light lingered," altering his life’s purpose. Escalation driven by accumulating confessions’ emotional weight, not coincidence, under Accumulative lens. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "dissolve walls between hearts" reweights via seashell confessions and pearl’s fusion, not moralizing. Final image ("cathedral") offers resonant answer—hope as latent radiance in darkness—without stated moral. Avoids false balance; bunkers’ isolation is flawed yet necessary, charged by farmer/scientist/child vignettes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "light that wasn’t light," "dripped like frozen tears" filters reality through inspector’s precision. Rhythm modulates under pressure—terse during climax ("During the heartbeat of a hesitation"), lyrical in closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as confessions surge ("he wasn’t just an inspector; he was a conduit").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "boots crunching over shards of obsidian" shows setting while advancing tension. Figurative language sparse but potent ("confessions began to unfurl... as emotions"). Final line avoids sentimentality—"music... hope" recharges "resonant hush" with earned specificity. No register drift during peak stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms bunker trope via "latent radiance" concept: confessions etched in shells, pearl as bridge, crystals as lattice. Specific details (cultivated pearl, obsidian shards) avoid generic apocalypse. Emotional truth in "I forgot to outlast myself" synthesizes universal longing. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
