<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (enthusiasm vs. stellar doubt) shown through micro-choices like coin arrangement, but "doubt" remains labeled rather than embodied; cost of shed doubt lacks visceral physicality at closure despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with cost ("doubt began to shed"), but the legibility of cost suffers from abstract phrasing; "symphony of light" final image powerfully reconfigures prophecy as mirror without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ambered observatory functions as micro-setting: its "memory of light" enables the static-burst work, and the final "ambered glow" charges the rebirth image; coins as recurring objects constrain choices by evolving from artifacts to conduits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake ("how to wavelength align") tightens when coins form a circuit, narrowing options from confusion to alignment; cost of shed doubt is visible but insufficiently embodied, missing the 8.8+ band's demand for visceral price at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (coins as circuit, static as test), avoiding abstraction; the final mirror metaphor reweights the prophecy without stating morals, earning resonance through Kael's embodied alignment rather than intellectual resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mind a sparkler of curiosity," "cold draft from the future") modulates under pressure; minor flaw in "stellar doubt" label slightly disrupts voice consistency during peak tension without undermining the accumulative rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("time itself pooled like honey," "breath fogging the glass"), but "stellar doubt" functions as a therapy-speak label artifact in a high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding closure-touching penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic prophecy via "wavelength align" transforms tropes through specific mechanics (coins as transmitters), though the tower/moon circuit leans slightly on familiar archetypes without sufficient verifiable detail to reach 9.0.</comment>
