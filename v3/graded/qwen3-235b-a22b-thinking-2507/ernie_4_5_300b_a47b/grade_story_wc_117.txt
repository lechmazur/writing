<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s skepticism-to-"cautious exuberance" shift, embodied through tactile choices (closing eyes against nature). Elara’s mellow patience manifests in cello-playing micro-choices under eclipse pressure. No diagnostic labels; flaws (Mara’s rigidity) compound organically before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mara taking the curl crystallizes stance crystallization with visible cost ("skepticism melted"). Accumulative lens holds—eclipse progression and sensory density tighten options toward the final image. Cost proof evident in "for when I forget," reconfiguring the curl’s meaning under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s "dreaming roots" and eclipse twilight function as micro-setting, constraining the magic (glow only visible in dim light). The curl’s physical properties charge closure when Mara pockets it, transforming "ordinary" into enduring symbol. Environment actively shapes the pivotal magical moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara’s wonder vs. skepticism) tightens through eclipse progression, narrowing options to belief or denial. Escalation driven by Mara’s agency—closing her eyes incurs cost (vulnerability), shifting stakes from abstract debate to embodied experience. Pressure grows via sensory accumulation, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the curl’s glow reweights "ordinary magic" without moralizing. Final image ("footsteps echoing with lifelong wonder") offers non-literal answer to "What if?" through Mara’s transformed stance. No thematic echo; complexity avoids false equivalence (Mara’s skepticism isn’t equally valid).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara’s musical lens colors descriptions ("notes spiraled upward, soft as moth wings"). Rhythmic control tightens under eclipse pressure; lyrical compression ("twilight hush") taught early and paid off in closure. Dialogue subtext ("It’s just hair") reveals status dynamics without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("ridge plunged into darkness" conveys time, place, mood). Final line’s specificity ("lifelong wonder") charges closure without sentimentality. Minor artifact: "softly adaptive" label appears twice without tactical cost, slightly dulling peak-beat immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "ordinary magic" trope transformed via baby hair curl’s mundane physics (glow requires eclipse dimness). Emotional specificity avoids generic templates—Mara’s shift from "voice lacked edge" to "warm" feels earned. Risk-taking heightens stakes through Accumulative lens without gimmickry.</comment>
