<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; "quietly driven" trait enables scaffolding climbs yet remains untested under true pressure. Sister Agatha's functional but flat secondary presence limits relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("I've only just begun to reckon") lands with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—single deciphering beat insufficient for Accumulative lens. No narrowing of options despite time pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber pavilion constrains choice via light shifts (dawn/dusk observations), and violet-glowing glass fragment charges final image. Micro-setting (magnifying glass) essential for critical discovery moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("why flowers bloom at night") signaled early but never viscerally threatened; no concrete cost scales with length. Pressure grows texturally yet lacks on-page trade-off or tactical shift when stakes peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("mysteries yet to unfold") reweights premise without moralizing; theme emerges through reversed blossoms and "umbral tenderness." Avoids thematic echo despite grandmother's "reckon" prompt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bioluminescent hues, as if walls breathed") with rhythmic control during scaffolding climb. Minor POV slip: "her voice frayed by coughing fits" intrudes on child-Mara's focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frosted lines, some so faint they seemed like scratches" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in "resonant vibration that made her teeth ache" but closure-untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms stained-glass trope through nocturnal botany lens; "umbral tenderness" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though "map to the hush" edges toward familiar mystical phrasing.</comment>
