<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in self-deception is clear but lacks embodied cost during climax; "breath caught" reaction to blueprint feels clinical rather than visceral. Micro-choices reveal value hierarchy only superficially during warehouse approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost ("weight of revelation"), but fails cost proof test: no specific line shows paid price beyond abstract realization. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to dawn epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Canal functions as micro-setting via sensory pressure (mud-sinking boots, lapping water), but warehouse spatial choreography weakens ("trunks spilling out"). Sundial constrains choice yet environment fails to charge final image—dawn glow remains generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering deception architecture) lacks tangible cost escalation; blueprint discovery deepens knowledge but no trade-offs or tactical shifts. Stakes remain intellectual despite strong early signaling of "test of his ability to see."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sundial symbolism without moralizing, but final "clarity" feels unearned—no concrete struggle shows cost of deception. Avoids thematic echo yet lacks resonant image reweighting; "world as it truly was" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid silver" canal, "drowned coins" eyes) with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively though "thoughtfully clear" trait isn't embodied during high-stakes blueprint moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks in climax ("he felt," "he understood") dull immediacy despite vivid imagery. Blueprint discovery uses clinical language ("breath caught") where concrete detail needed; minor scaffold in warehouse description slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms treasure-hunt trope through conceptual focus on deception architecture. Specific sundial details ground premise, but "machine as metaphor" reveal feels derivative. Emotional truth in self-deception angle elevates without fresh inflection.</comment>
