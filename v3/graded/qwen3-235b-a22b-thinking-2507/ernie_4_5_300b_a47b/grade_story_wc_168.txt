<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt vs acceptance) act simultaneously during hourglass scene; final renunciation of self-punishment earned by tactile micro-choices like tipping the sand. "You are not broken" whisper avoids diagnostic label-speak through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "I hear you" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (frozen sand now flowing). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density peaks at hourglass moment where sensory details reweight fire’s meaning. Orientation anchors within 47 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ridge path constrains choices as "threshold" and guides final walk; porcelain box charges closure when moonlight catches moving sand. Sensory hierarchy flawless—firefighter notices "acrid smoke" not flowers, frost-laced gravel under boots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Elias’s agency: opening the box changes knowledge from avoidance to acceptance. Cost legible in "throat tightened" and scarred face softening. Single deepening suffices for length but lacks mid-beat tradeoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of flowing sand reweights fire’s duality without moralizing. "Ash nourished new life" earns wisdom through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo. Complexity in embracing destruction/transformation without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "reading the land’s breath" filters all observation. Rhythm modulates from staccato ("He tipped the hourglass") to flowing during acceptance. Zero register drift—"hard softness" idiosyncratic to voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "frost-laced gravel" and "glacial melt" achieve high density without muddle. Slight overwriting in "liquid silver" sand but justified by closure payoff. Final line’s "belonged in their rhythm" avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope via herbalist mother’s legacy and "pain as fertilizer" specificity. Emotional truth in scarred face softening avoids generic redemption. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
