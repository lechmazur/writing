<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; Veyra's resolve lacks layered conflict despite clear motivation. "Regally unpretentious" trait remains label-only without constraining choices under pressure, weakening emotional progression. Final claim of heirship feels earned but lacks visceral cost beyond external victory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost: pretender's dissolution into "hollow shell" and static voice. Causal lens holds perfectly—"because/therefore" chain from Silent Convergence timing to ink activation narrows options. Persistent constraint (celestial alignment window) shapes climax tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Temple library micro-setting actively constrains choices: mosaic trapdoor access and Silent Convergence timing directly enable climax. Recurring ink pellet charges final image ("cold in her hand") while constellations evolve from frozen to "alive," reweighting the realm's truth with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Veyra's agency: deciphering messages → interpreting celestial pause → hurling ink at critical moment. Cost is unmistakable in pretender's "voice dissolving into static" and hollow revelation. One tightening (convergence timing) sufficiently forecloses pretender's path under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth/illusion emerges through concrete action (ink sundering crown), not abstraction. Final image—stars resuming journey as Veyra smiles—offers resonant, non-literal answer to legacy corruption without moralizing. Avoids false binaries by framing courtiers' bow as "recognition," not simplistic redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Veyra notices constellations as "frozen dance of fate," tomes as "whispering secrets." Rhythmic control under pressure—"steps echoing like a heartbeat"—avoids syntactic monotony. Purposeful compression (e.g., "eons deciphering") taught early pays off in climax velocity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor artifact: "regally unpretentious" appears as label without embodied demonstration, creating slight thematic dissonance. Otherwise, high density ("skin peeling away to reveal hollow shell") and clear propulsion. No loops; final line recharges constellation motif with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "truth-revealing ink" trope through iron gall specificity and graceful collapse resolution. Emotional truth in Veyra's quiet purpose avoids generic heroism. Risk-taking in poetic chamber dissolution heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise leans familiar without deeper moral complexity.</comment>
