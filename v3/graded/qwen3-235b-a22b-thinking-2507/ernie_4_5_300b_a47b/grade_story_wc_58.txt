<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—needing to explain absences yet accepting their permanence—drive micro-choices like her quill-dance during the vision. No therapy-speak; "chest ached with lonesome splendor" embodies grief. Final renunciation of closure ("explained absences were not endings") earns cost through tactile details: moss on knees, fading thread vibration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "explained absences were not endings but beginnings" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (weight of unanswered questions). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density—jasmine scent, thread vibration—reweighting "geography of healing." Refrain "after last ship sailed" overused (3x), risking cadence loop (-0.1).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden moss and thread constrain choice: Elara must kneel to trace the "ghost weft," her ink-stained fingers brushing it as a tool. Final image ("threads glowing faintly in twilight") charges closure by reweighting loss as connection. Sensory hierarchy flawless—crisis narrows to thread vibration, calm admits jasmine scent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping healing's geography) tightens through thread's fading vibration—visible cost forcing Elara's realization. Agency via projection method narrows options: "vibration faded... woman vanished" forecloses direct communion. Stakes remain visceral via "heart lighter" physicality, but external pressure lacks teeth; purely internal deepening suffices for Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from thread-as-absence-language: "each weft a syllable in a poem she could not finish." Final image ("parchment cradled... map of lives restored") answers "can absence heal?" without moralizing. Loses 0.2 for near-on-the-nose "explained absences were not endings," but earned through sensory work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ink-stained fingers," "vividly descriptive prose" shown via "silver river" thread metaphor. Rhythmic control peaks during vision—"quill dancing," "breath syncing with leaves." No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks to "felt her gaze" when stakes heighten. Lyric compression taught early ("harbor fallen silent") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "thread hummed... low resonant vibration" propels via sensory density. "Lonesome splendor" repeats 4x with earned variation (description → embodied ache → purpose). Minor cadence loop in "after last ship sailed" refrain (-0.1), but final line ("walked into fading light") avoids overwriting. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "obituary writer" trope through specific logic: healing as "geography to be charted." Fresh inflection in "ghost weft" as absence-language. Avoids safety-middle via bold Earned Stasis closure rejecting tidy resolution. Derivative risk avoided by grounding "projection" in tactile details (moss, thread vibration), not mystical abstraction.</comment>
