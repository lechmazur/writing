<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (silent balladeer encoding needs) drives micro-choices; embodied emotion via trembling plate and charcoal trails. Lacks active struggle against external pressure beyond storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("messages fade but ghost remembers") lands with conceptual cost (ephemeral art enduring through spectral memory). Accumulative lens holds, but storm escalation lacks causal pressure tightening options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (steadying hand), charges final image (warm metal holding bluebell). Mist/courtyard evocative but static; weather affects action insufficiently beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unspoken needs) signaled early; storm intensifies encoding urgency. Agency clear in graffiti choices, but pressure lacks meaningful narrowing of options—Elias works uninterrupted until rain washes messages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bluebell press and fading graffiti reconfigure "unspoken needs finding home" without moralizing. Final image (humming plate) resonates as non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tinkersong wonder," "frayed edges of cloud") modulates with storm intensity. Minor POV leakage in "courtyard held few listeners" disrupts focalization; syntactic monotony in action sequence ("He began... Next... As he worked...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loop in "mist curled... driftingly alert" then "mist grew thicker, driftingly alert" dulls immediacy. Elevated diction ("driftingly alert") clashes with Elias' lexicon in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "silent communicator" trope through ghost-in-code mechanics and flower press symbolism. Risk-taking (lyric encoding method) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; avoids safety middle via Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
