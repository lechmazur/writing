<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (logic vs wonder) act simultaneously in high-pressure beats; her final shift to empathy is earned by micro-choices like positioning the shell, with embodied cost ("ache in her chest"). No diagnostic labels or stock emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the final realization reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("ache in her chest"), under a held Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost proof is explicit in the physical sensation during resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory’s micro-setting constrains choice (frozen dials respond only to shell vibrations) and charges the final image (dome opening to stars). Tool specificity (cello bridge position) alters tactics, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency (playing cello) under Accumulative lens, reweighting stakes via density increase. Cost is unmistakable ("ache in her chest"), though the shell’s magic slightly blurs causal ownership in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the final image (humming into wind) offers a resonant non-literal answer to the riddle without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity stems from Lira’s earned shift from logic to empathy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes swirled in slanting light") and rhythmic control under pressure (tightened syntax during humming climax). Elision of astronomer’s backstory is taught early and paid off via micro-choices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("brittle and sad, like a memory trying to reform"). Minor register drift in "ephemeral compass" (slightly academic for peak beat) prevents 9.5+, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Specific synthesis (science/music via shell vibrations) feels inevitable. "Gloomy cheerfulness" transforms tropes through lived detail; emotional truth avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
