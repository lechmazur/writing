<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in peak moment; "volcanic tenderness" stated but not embodied through conflicting actions during the tear-painting climax. Interiority strong elsewhere but closure choice lacks visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as CR lands perfectly with cost ("tears streaming" + "garden" realization), but lens (Accumulative) could be signaled earlier than "walls shiver." Orientation flawless within 20 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (the eye) constrains the final choice and charges closure; archive's "humming" walls actively alter tactics. Obsidian ink's physicality proves indispensable to the healing act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening through protagonist agency ("painting the tear") forecloses preservation path with visible cost. Pressure escalates via ink's transformative property, reweighting options decisively at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "garden" metaphor evolution from whisper to identity; final "gardener" reconfiguration avoids moralizing while reweighting all prior vandalism as tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in brushstroke analysis, but "volcanic tenderness" description slips into abstract label. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless during healing sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; obsidian ink description exemplifies concrete propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop ("She’d stolen... She’d gone") prevents 9.5+, but closure imagery remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "arsonist" trope through tactile library love; tapestry fragment integration elevates beyond cliché. Risk-taking (vandalism as tenderness) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
