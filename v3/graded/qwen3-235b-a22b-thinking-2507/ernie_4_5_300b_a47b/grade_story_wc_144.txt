<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority shines through tactile expertise and humming lullaby micro-choice; blindness isn’t a trait but a sensory framework driving her servo recalibration under pressure. Marlow’s "gift" dialogue risks sentimentality but lands through embodied shoulder touch and her embarrassed shrug.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: ship vanishing into clouds while Lira returns to endless repairs crystallizes her endurance with visible cost ("work would never end"). Accumulative lens holds—the water basin’s light refracts escalating solutions, culminating in the basin’s dawn glow recharging the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The water basin constrains every choice: diagnosing HB-7’s fracture, mapping servo oscillations, and validating repair. Its final refraction of dawn light charges the closure image, transforming tool into thematic anchor without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency—patching the wing while recalibrating the servo narrows options to tactile precision. Cost is felt in her shift from doubt ("needed more") to quiet competence, though the anchor lift’s dawn deadline lacks visceral time pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "mending the invisible" crystallizes in the basin’s refracted light guiding drones. Final image of Lira repairing another drone rejects tidy resolution, charging "listening’s a kind of seeing" through action, not Marlow’s near-echoing dialogue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—Lira’s world filters through heat, vibration, and prismatic ripples. "Liquid sunlight" iridescence avoids cliché by serving her tactile POV; Marlow’s voice distinct in pragmatic rumbles ("Problem’s deeper than a patch").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic hues on the walls" and "magnetic calm" deepen motif without muddle. Final line’s "mended the invisible, one patch at a time" delivers propulsion and closure weight in nine words—no figurative excess in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Blind artisan repairing drones via water refraction transforms repair tropes through sensory specificity. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the rail depot’s mist slightly echoes generic steampunk ambiance.</comment>
