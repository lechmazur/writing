<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices: stacking stones despite dismissing "sailors' superstition," then placing sea glass where light once shone. Embodied emotion avoids labels ("ache of the dark remained, but now it was luminescent"). Slight abstraction in "bottle the feeling" but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is perfect Charged Poise: "a new kind of light glowed—not of flame, but of connection" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with felt cost ("ache of the dark remained"). Accumulative lens holds from lamp failure to final sea glass warmth. Minor deduction for "ghostly moan" wind detail feeling slightly decorative in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (sea glass, stacked stones) constrains choices and charges closure: glass placement where lamp stood, stones as "tiny beacon," final pocket warmth. Sensory details filter through keeper’s bias ("air tasted of iron and brine," noticing rust patterns). No generic placeholder descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving safety’s essence) tightens through letter chain: each note narrows options (must stack stones, place glass). Elias’s agency drives escalation—his choices alter tactics (kerosene lantern use, stone placement). Cost is visceral: enduring darkness now "luminescent" with shared hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: stone stacks as "tiny beacon," sea glass holding "sea’s breath." Final image ("sea glass warm in his pocket, its song a quiet hymn") reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—complexity lingers in "luminescent ache" of enduring darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: keeper notices light angles, rust patterns, salt-streaked windows. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Each creak of the wood a familiar refrain"). Minor deduction for "flicker of curiosity" abstraction, but compensated by immediate concrete action (stacking stones).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("pale blue, smoothed by years of tumbling in the surf"). Final line’s "song a quiet hymn" achieves textural payoff without overwriting. Slight abstraction in "flicker of curiosity" compensated by kinetic follow-up ("kneeling, he selected three smooth stones").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through specific mechanics: stone stacking as message system, sea glass carrying "sea’s breath." Emotional truth in "bottle the feeling" via gestures, not sentiment. Risk of quiet Accumulative structure pays off—no safety hedging in Elias’s flawed, enduring stance.</comment>
