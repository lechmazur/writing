<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s shift from seeker to inheritor, but micro-choices under pressure lack distinct tradeoffs; the fireplace ritual feels inevitable rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: burning the negative and finding the locket crystallizes legacy’s cost with the visceral "warmth" and whisper. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivy-choked passage actively constrains movement and supplies the diaries/fireplace; the moss denying footprints and soot-stained glass charging the climax prove micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the groaning walls and diaries’ warnings, but the alcove’s sudden reveal feels coincidental rather than earned by Lira’s agency under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"You are the map" reweights the central question through physical inheritance (locket) without moralizing; the burned negative transforms abstract legacy into embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("feeling tremors of a world that whispered through cracks") modulates perfectly with tension; no POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "brittle paper, melted wax, the jagged edge" risks synonym churn; near-flawless density where every image charges closure (glowing ashes → warm locket).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Climate-shifted architecture as living memory feels fresh; risks lyric abstraction but grounds universals in specific moss/ivy textures and copper locket’s weight.</comment>
