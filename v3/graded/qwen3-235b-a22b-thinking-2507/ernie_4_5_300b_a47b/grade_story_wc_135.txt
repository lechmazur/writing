<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s methodical patience shows embodied motivation, but her internal contradiction (archive duty vs. exile trauma) lacks visceral layering; the fisherman encounter reveals character through action, yet her core drive remains slightly abstract without sufficient flawed struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the trumpet’s resonant note crystallizes mended history with undeniable conceptual cost (exile’s voids transformed), while the Accumulative lens holds through staggered site returns that tighten options toward wholeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The trumpet valve functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its gleam in the museum and sonic "hearten" directly constrain Lirael’s archival tactics and reconfigure the harbor’s meaning, elevating specificity beyond atmospheric description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lirael’s agency: each staggered return narrows options (journal discovery → fisherman’s tale → locket revelation), but the exile’s "salt-sting" could deepen the felt cost earlier to heighten pressure beyond procedural success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the mosaic metaphor reweights history through the valve’s journey from relic to bridge, avoiding moralizing—though the final "symphony" line edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Lirael’s archival focus ("observing how vendors avoided the plaza"), with rhythmic control under pressure; staggered-interval pacing teaches the Accumulative lens without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density in phrases like "fractured like shattered glass" propels momentum—yet "reactively visionary" appears twice as label-only description, slightly muddling the valve’s tangible role in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archival work as emotional repair feels inevitable, with the harbor’s ivory stone and trumpet valve transforming exile tropes through specific, charged objects—though the "mosaic" conceit leans slightly familiar without deeper subversion.</comment>
