<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "hating silence" yet seeking beauty in silence; embodied grief via damp violin and bowl warmth; micro-choice placing violin over bowl reveals hierarchy of values. No second character limits relationship depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("threshold, not wall") with felt cost (bowl's vibration, community's tentative voices); Accumulative lens holds through resonance density; cost legible in "warm to the touch, alive with vibration" at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse constrains choice (violin placement over bowl) and charges final image (orchard/shipwrecks as "beginning"); humidity affects strings, shipwrecks amplify sound—environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake ("break silence wall") tightens via violin-bowl resonance; agency-driven deepening reweights grief as potential; cost visible in physical vibration and community's hesitant participation. One intensification suffices for Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bowl holds potential" revelation, not moralizing; final image ("light in the ash") reweights "beauty in unfinished" without abstraction; avoids sentimentality via concrete offerings (seashell, twig) woven into closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature as musician ("drip of condensation," "creak of hulls"); rhythmic control mirrors tension (tentative first note → "richer, fuller" swell); no POV drift despite crowd presence. Minor register dip in "unbinding" metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("music pooled in hollows of the world"); "tarnished surface glowing faintly" charges closure. Slight overwriting in "chronic hush... transformed" (0.3 deduction) but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of acoustics/grief; "mendicant’s bowl holding space" transforms trope; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specific shipwreck-greenhouse physics grounds universality.</comment>
