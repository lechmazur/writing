<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "fierce tenderness" borders on abstract labeling in peak beats, slightly undermining embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (shard's smoothed edges), but Accumulative/Textural lens isn't confirmed until paragraph 4, missing midpoint clarity required for 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mangrove functions as active micro-setting: roots guide exit, water enables condensation messages, and the shard's physical transformation charges the final image with undeniable constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through atmospheric accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Lirael passively receives revelations rather than making choices that narrow options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "unsent letters" motif, with final image reweighting regret as growth; minor deduction for recurring "fierce tenderness" phrasing risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots clawed at the sky like ancient fingers") with rhythmic control, but "fierce tenderness" repetition creates a minor tic under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion and density; one paraphrase loop ("fierce tenderness" x3) triggers -0.2 but avoids closure impact, preserving high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mangrove ecology and unsent letters avoids cliché, but premise ("recovering lost words") lacks bold structural risk-taking to reach 9.0+.</comment>
