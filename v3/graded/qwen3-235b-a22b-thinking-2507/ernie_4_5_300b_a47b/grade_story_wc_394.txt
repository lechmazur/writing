<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in rejecting kaleidoscope's crash vision while embodying "steadily curious" via micro-choices; near-abstract "yearning algorithm" slightly dilutes embodied emotion at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: kaleidoscope patterns accumulate toward Conceptual Repricing (bell's hum reweights "sound" with conceptual cost); minor lens ambiguity early (<120 words) barely impedes closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Acid sea workshop functions as micro-setting—eating tools forces speed, sulfurous winds enable glider flight; "skeletal frame of whirring gears" concretely constrains choices while charging the final hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: transliterating visions alters glider tactics under acid-mist pressure; cost crystallizes in the bell's conceptual hum (unheard sound made visceral), reweighting the dominant stake unmistakably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—transliterating patterns becomes "bending yearning into motion"; final hum reweights "ring a bell no one hears" without moralizing, avoiding abstraction through acid-sea ripples.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("air tasted of rust and possibility") and rhythmic compression under stress ("She twisted the barrel faster") create distinct texture; kaleidoscope's "fractured glass" mirrors narrative pattern-teaching.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "acid sea below roared, as if annoyed" exemplifies high-density propulsion; figurative language sparse but potent ("irreverent awe blooming"), never muddling climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms steampunk tropes via "yearning algorithm" as desire-made-motion; risk-taking (conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior pattern accumulation.</comment>
