<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete micro-choices (dipping hand in water sphere, arrow tip vibration), but final thematic echo ("symphony, learned to listen") edges toward unearned wisdom without sufficient embodied struggle in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: arrow insertion triggers irreversible symbiosis revelation. Cost crystallizes in "hadn't found a machine to exploit, but a truth to protect" with visible stakes reconfiguration during the inversion climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Water spheres and arrow tip function as micro-settings that directly constrain choices—the glider landing and pedestal insertion hinge on their physical properties, charging the final image with liquid light rain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the arrow fuses, foreclosing exploitation paths, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "truth to protect" lacks tangible sacrifice beyond mindset shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through vine behavior and echoes, but the final "symphony" metaphor risks sentimentality, nearly crossing into thematic echo by over-articulating the lesson in the last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pilot’s observations ("river’s flow quickened, pulling her"), though final paragraph’s "symphony" metaphor slightly drifts from earlier grounded lexicon into abstract lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor synonym churn in "thrashing upward/roots exposed/fruit tumbling" creates rhythmic drag, and "whirling silence" repetition weakens density without pattern payoff in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological symbiosis with gravity inversion mechanics transforms tropes; "living archive" concept avoids eco-fable clichés through specific cause-effect chains in vine behavior.</comment>
