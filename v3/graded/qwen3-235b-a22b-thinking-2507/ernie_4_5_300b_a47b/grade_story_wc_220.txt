<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation to "translate distance into closeness" but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; bloodhound traits underutilized beyond sniffing grooves. "Intuitively descriptive" phrasing feels diagnostic rather than embodied under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "wild hush" transforms into "hum of connection" with undeniable conceptual cost of the war's isolation. Accumulative lens holds through riddle progression, but escalation lacks meaningful friction—solutions arrive too readily without struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Scrapyard setting actively constrains choices: the phonograph cylinder is found in scrap, the wax leaf relic hangs in a shack. Final image of "wax-preserved veins glowing in sunlight" directly charges closure by reweighting the "cracked world" premise through concrete micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community connection) signaled early but escalation lacks pressure; riddles solved without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. Agency isn't tested—wind "carries something else" feels coincidental rather than earned causality under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "love grows when shared" crystallizes via children tracing grooves, not moralizing. Final leaf image reweights "cracked world" premise with conceptual cost of isolation, avoiding sentimentality through scrapyard specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("nose following grooves like a map") and rhythmic control, but Jeb's dialogue lacks distinct voice—phrasing like "tinted revelations" feels generic. No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure's lyrical shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "tinted revelations" in Jeb's dialogue risks thematic echo. Final line's "hum of connection" avoids sentimentality through concrete "grooves" imagery. No loops, yet "wild hush" repetition borders on overuse in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific mechanics: "distance as currency" and phonograph grooves as tactile memory. Emotional truth in "river without water" = scarred earth avoids cliché. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
