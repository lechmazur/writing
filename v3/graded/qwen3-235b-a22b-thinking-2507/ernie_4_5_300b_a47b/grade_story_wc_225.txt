<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. acceptance) act simultaneously in plucking threads; closure choice earned via chess metaphor. Slight over-tidiness in epiphany ("some threads couldn't be untangled") softens emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("weight on his chest lifting") under Accumulative lens. Thunder's shift from distant to close tightens pressure, but "woven hush" mechanism lacks concrete causality in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth and ring function as micro-settings constraining choices; dissolving walls charge final image. Tapestry threads' color symbolism avoids cliché through tactile use ("crimson for guilt").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through thread-decoding deepening; "fierce repose" movement crystallizes stance. Cost ("weight lifting") slightly abstract for Accumulative escalation requiring denser pressure shift at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final tapestry image reweights guilt/redemption without moralizing. "Some threads couldn't be untangled" borders on thematic echo but saved by concrete embroidery action charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in chess tutor's pattern recognition ("platinum labyrinth etched into cobblestones"). Slight register drift in "woven hush" phrasing disrupts voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding; "fidgeted productively" exemplifies fresh diction. Minor loop in "frozen in expressions... frozen in a rush" deducts in high-stakes closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy and textile metaphors transforms frozen-time trope. Emotional specificity in guilt ("second shadow") avoids generic redemption arcs; risk-taking elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
