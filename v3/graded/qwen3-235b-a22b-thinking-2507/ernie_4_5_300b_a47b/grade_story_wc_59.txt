<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fractured grandeur mirroring his state) and embodied emotion ("hands trembled," "tears streaming") anchor motivation, but closure lacks authentic cost—Thalos' convenient arrival negates struggle, making reawakening feel unearned rather than a true endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise as palace blooms) reweights stakes with conceptual cost, but Accumulative lens falters: no felt price for rebirth beyond abstract "imperfection," and Thalos' sudden appearance breaks coherent pressure—Mechanists' threat evaporates without consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Suspended palace actively constrains choices (stalactite vibrations inform contraption) and charges closure (stone blooming with moss), passing 9+ gate; "liquid starlight" vials and marble floor cracks evolve causally with the egg's hatching.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—pressure peaks with the egg's crack, yet no tangible cost (e.g., Corvin's sacrifice) narrows options; Mechanists remain off-page abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the egg's flawed orb ("fragile, imperfect thing") avoiding moralizing, but "we'll grow" dialogue states the thesis, nearly triggering Thematic Echo penalty; final image reweights "flawed genesis" with organic ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cave dust," "oil and regret" air) shines, but rhythmic control frays under pressure—lyrical density ("bitterly sweet crescendo") stays uniform during climax instead of compressing; no psychic distance shifts for Corvin's tears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure, but "tears streaming down his cheeks" is bodily cliché; overwriting in high-pressure beat ("keening sound... pierced the very stone") risks figurative muddle, capping Q7 per artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "magical egg" trope via flawed orb and suspended biomechanical world, but emotional risk lacks teeth—Mechanists' threat resolves too cleanly, missing the bold stakes transformation needed for 9+.</comment>
