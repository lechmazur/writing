<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (dust vs exploration) drives micro-choices like touching the chip, but father's vision lacks earned friction; embodied emotions strong yet epiphany edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("shelves still dusty, but now Lila smiled"), but printer's "empirically intuitive" line slightly undermines organic buildup to the cavern's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Creek swell and ants constrain choices (path selection), while the chip's physicality charges the final image; bioluminescent fungi and obsidian pedestal deepen setting beyond backdrop to active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lila's agency (deciding to enter cavern), with cost legible in her transformed return; "lingering promise" reframing avoids abstract stakes but mid-vision softens tension slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (dust, ants, chip), but "courage to choose" phrasing near closure veers toward thematic echo, narrowly avoiding final-paragraph moralizing penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle as dried leaves," "emerald shards") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in descent sequence flawless, with no head-hopping despite vision shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ghostly figures" metaphor slightly clichéd but redeemed by "sunflowers towering" specificity in vision; propulsion flawless even in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of antique trade with emotional archaeology; "crawling ants as map" trope transformed via concrete stakes, though cavern vision risks derivative familiarity without chip's tactile specificity.</comment>
