<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scrawny girl vs proving worth) drive choices, but "indifference kills faster than bullets" is diagnostic label-speak in climax triggering -0.5. Jax lacks depth as secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure ("the line had held") lands with felt cost (station destroyed), but "Dive!" command underwater violates physics, breaking causality in closure beat. Non-closure accumulation cap (-0.8) applied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lagoon functions as micro-setting: mud hinders movement, bioluminescent algae guides tunnel navigation. Final image ("key warm in her palm," lagoon fading to silver) charges closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally when drones force dive—agency-driven escalation. Cost (station explosion) visibly alters tactics. Physics flaw in "Dive!" yell slightly undermines pressure legibility at peak moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through revised histories files and final lagoon imagery (stars "winking like secrets"), but "indifference kills" line in climax is thematic echo triggering -0.6 penalty. Avoids direct moralizing otherwise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details (mud, numbing water), but Jax's generic dialogue ("Carefully resourceful") and underwater "Dive!" error show focalization slippage under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Molten gold that seemed to swallow the horizon" creates mixed metaphor; template cadence in action beats ("Mara pulled... Mara shrugged"). Non-closure accumulation cap (-1.5) for two distinct artifacts near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-rebellion (puddle maps, phone key history) feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in Mara's slum background elevates trope, but auric lagoon leans slightly familiar.</comment>
