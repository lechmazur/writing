<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (tremor vs. steady hands), embodied emotion through brass handle's pulse, and final renunciation of tragedy for rebirth feels earned. Slight abstraction in "resolve as steady as hum" prevents 9.0+ under 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "room was a cradle" reweights sepia tomb with visible cost (tears, shifted worldview). Causal lens holds perfectly—crank turns directly trigger compartment reveal. No orientation debt; cost proof clear in final resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gramophone crank constrains choice (triggers compartment) and charges final image (cradle vs. tomb). "Sepia" risks cliché but "golden shadows" evolves meaning from oppressive to hopeful. Micro-setting gate satisfied, yet atmospheric precision stops short of 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (truth about dynasty's end) tightens through crank turns escalating to visions. Agency-driven escalation (Lirael's choices narrow options to sacrifice), with cost legible in weeping and legacy shift. Minor convenience in gramophone mechanics prevents 9.0 under quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of sacrificial silence emerges through concrete letters ("calculated erasure"), not moralizing. Final image reweights "sepia tomb" into "cradle" as non-literal answer to "dynasty ender" question. Avoids thematic echo—grandmother's letter states facts, not morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("muse was quiet between notes") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats ("groan... crackle... hum"). Minor register drift in "resolve as steady as hum" but patterned elision (visions) taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "golden shadows softened, and Lirael realized she was crying" achieves triple duty (action/emotion/image). Figurative language sparse but precise in peak beats. "Bridge of intuition" phrasing slightly abstract yet doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted object" trope through standing waves as historical resonance. Fresh inflection: dynasty ends via self-erasure, not war. Risk-taking (sound as memory) heightens stakes without gimmickry—transformation test passed with emotional specificity.</comment>
