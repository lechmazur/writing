<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (dismissing folklore yet following the dust), but emotional progression lacks visceral degradation under stress; "mossy delight" edges toward abstract labeling without deeper somatic cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the dissolving moonstone and golden-streaked sky crystallize stakes with conceptual cost, holding Accumulative/Textural lens through the monuments' pattern-weaving climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arbor’s micro-setting (bark, seeds, mist) directly constrains choices—monuments built from environment enable leaf-reading, charging the final image where branches "lean closer" as active witnesses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elinor’s agency (prod → monuments → decoding), but the storm/silverseed warnings lack visceral immediacy; cost remains conceptual (dust’s dissolution) without physical or relational toll on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: folklore as living language reweights the opening dismissal into action, with the final line ("the world made sense") offering resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"calloused hands knew the rhythm," "mossy green haze"—with rhythmic control deepening under pressure; no head-hopping, and elision (traveler backstory) taught/paid off via monument mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or action ("dust speck glowed brighter, its light weaving through the monuments like a thread" merges image, pressure, and payoff without muddle).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms folklore tropes through grounded specifics (silverseed harvest, constellation monuments); "emerges transformed always" reweights the moonstone’s role from superstition to catalyst with emotional inevitability.</comment>
