<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "intimately aloof" moment and sketching climax, but cave danger backstory lacks specific embodied cost for the "wrong turn" motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "shoulders relaxing for the first time in years" crystallizes his endurance of time's fractures under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The seashell constrains choices (placement ritual) and charges the final image, though "brine and limestone" scent lacks visceral specificity for 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory density (pool reflection, warm water surprise), but mirror-crack urgency lacks a live clock to deepen the "temporary eternity" pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Secret etched in salt and light" reweights the central question through concrete action (sketch placement), avoiding moralizing while embracing time's complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Painterly perceptual signature ("light felt sharper, almost accusatory") shines, but filter verbs in high-pressure cave moments dull immediacy slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong density overall, but paraphrase loop in transition ("footsteps echoed... tunnel forked") and template cadence in path description cost 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "healing journey" trope via painterly details and warm-water pool subversion; emotional specificity in shell ritual avoids generic templates.</comment>
