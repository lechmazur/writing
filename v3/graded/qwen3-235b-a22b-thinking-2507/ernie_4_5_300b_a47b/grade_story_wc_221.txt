<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confusion as shadow" vs. "compass") embodied through smudged ink and clutching compass; micro-choices (choosing path without overanalysis) earn the final stance shift with visible cost in fragmented colleagues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when compass warms during nonsensical path choice; cost of reweighted confusion crystallizes in "adriftness was a kind of freedom" with Accumulative/Textural lens holding through spiral staircase descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Gilded compass rose evolves from decorative object to active constraint, charging final image with warmth in palm; meteorite dust ink and warped constellations demonstrate purposeful specificity that shapes Elio's ritual and choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (confusion vs. exploration) tightens through glimpse-induced grandmother encounter; agency-driven escalation as Elio's path choice reconfigures "true north" with felt cost in smudged sketch and irreversible perspective shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image of compass warming reweights "true north" as action rather than direction without moralizing; grandmother's "confusion is exploration's first draft" earns thematic resonance through concrete prior struggle, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("constellations warp through distortion field," "time dilated like syrup") maintains consistent temporal distortion; rhythmic control shifts from languid contemplation to staccato urgency during glimpse without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed" parchment edges and "dulled by decades of neglect" exemplify textural specificity; final line "his heart quiet" resolves opening "echoed silence" with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "true north" from navigational trope to philosophical stance; compass rose's evolution feels inevitable in hindsight while avoiding derivative time-travel tropes through emotional specificity of sketching ritual.</comment>
