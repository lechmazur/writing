<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete cues (ribbon, copper wire) avoids therapy-speak, but Mara’s absence limits relationship crucible; "endearingly feisty" trait lacks embodied tradeoffs during mending pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (ribbon slipping/recaught), but orchard bloom feels coincidental rather than causally tied to mending; Accumulative lens holds via sensory reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orchard/cathedral setting constrains choices (climbing branches, moss cradle) and charges final image; liquid starlight’s specificity elevates beyond decorative magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mending legacy) tightens via copper wire application, but cost remains conceptual (no tangible loss); pressure deepens through Accumulative lens yet lacks visceral forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from mending ritual → "accidental wisdom" refrain; avoids moralizing but final "mend the world" line risks thematic echo, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("leaves whispering secrets," "petals raining like confetti"); consistent lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s quiet strength without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mossy cradle" and "dappled light" exemplify textural specificity, though "liquid starlight" edges toward ornamental magic without mid-scene cost demonstration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mending as generational metaphor avoids trope; "deciduous vows" transforms contractual language into organic stakes, but cathedral orchard setting leans slightly familiar.</comment>
