<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (caution vs urgency), but "softly deliberate" stated not embodied; tears at closure show cost, yet diagnostic label "hunger—not for destruction" slightly undermines embodied emotion during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (shadow dissolving into motes reconfigures hope's meaning), but cost legibility wavers—tears signal emotional toll yet lack specific prior sacrifice; lens (Accumulative) holds through video comparison tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: river stone constrains choices (must be held/cracked) and charges final image; petrified petal shelves evolve with plot. "Above clouds" setting ornamental—no spatial pressure on tactics despite luminous atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density (shadow's hunger sharpening), but antagonistic pressure underdeveloped—why "bloom" resolves crisis feels unearned; protagonist agency strong in video comparison, yet final turn lacks visible tradeoff beyond emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone/spiral motif reweighting (hope as shape-shifting, not fixed); avoids moralizing via final image ("given it room to grow"). Near-echo of "bloom" in title risks thematic redundancy, narrowly escaping final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sharp eyes tracing dusk’s approach") and rhythmic control under pressure; psychic distance shifts intentionally during shadow confrontation. Minor diction drift ("luminous with regret" slightly corporate for librarian POV).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("spines rearranging into new titles" does triple duty). "Hunger—not for destruction" slightly overwrites embodied sensation, but final image’s propulsion saves peak beat. Zero artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dream-tech and hope metaphysics, but "shapeless hope" trope feels familiar; emotional truth in Lirael’s quiet urgency elevates. Risk-taking (video comparison as time travel) coherent yet lacks non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>
