<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (amoral yet sentimental) with embodied micro-choices like pouring the vial, but final endurance lacks the 9+ "contradictory impulses acting in scene" depth; the ritual feels slightly abstract rather than viscerally conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the final "fractured grace" image reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—but the thunder's retreat/reappearance strains accumulative logic slightly, preventing a 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt flat functions as essential micro-setting: constrains choices (kneeling in salt, egg placement) and charges closure; the crack-map evolves causally with wind shifts, meeting 9+ gate perfectly through tangible pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening via sensory accumulation (thunder, salt, light) is masterful under accumulative lens, but "meaning was what you manufactured" slightly over-articulates the moral calculus, diluting the earned cost in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars—the egg's dissolution and final "echo" image reweight the premise without moralizing—but the "crave grace" line edges toward thematic echo, blocking 9.5+ despite otherwise flawless resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ghostly blue," "salt crunching") and rhythmic control excel, but "manufactured when nature failed you" drifts into corporate diction, disrupting the philanthropist's voice during critical reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("gloved hand—a relic..."). Minor register drift in "rare, genuine curve of his lips" avoids penalty but prevents 9.5+; closure beat remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of amoral eco-villain with secret sentimentality avoids cliché through specific details (vial of last water, luxury resort pivot), but the "fractured grace" concept, while bold, lacks the transformative risk distinction for 9.2+.</comment>
