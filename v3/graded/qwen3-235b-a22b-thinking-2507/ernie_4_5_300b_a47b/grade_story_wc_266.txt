<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("weight lifted from his chest") without embodied contradiction; Jorin's anxiety lacks specific physical manifestation. "Courage wasn’t a place—it was a choice" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty in peak beat without immediate embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: leaving the punch reconfigures the vigil’s purpose with felt cost in Jorin’s changed stance. However, "leash breaks" premise lacks causal traction—it’s stated but never tests their choices, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway shifts vividly ("meadow of thorns became a bridge of roots") but remains decorative; no constraint on choices. Ticket punch’s star could be any symbol, failing 9+ gate requiring environment/tool to charge final image. Strong specificity without tactical pressure caps score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("find unused courage") stay abstract—no dramatized trade-offs or costs during journey. Escalation is atmospheric (twilight deepening) not pressure-driven; the ridgeway’s shifts complicate without altering tactics. Cost legibility relies on thematic assertion, not concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ticket-stamp constellations and river metaphor, avoiding moralizing. Final image (punch left behind) resonates as non-literal answer to "where courage waits." But "courage is a river" borders on thematic echo, slightly muddying earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (Lira’s "shoreline lullaby" voice vs. Jorin’s fidgeting) modulates well. However, verbatim repetition of "shoreline lullaby" phrase creates paraphrase loop, dulling rhythm under pressure and violating consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Duplicate "shoreline lullaby" line in paragraphs 1 and 4 constitutes paraphrase loop in final third, triggering -1.7 penalty. Overwritten descriptions ("bruised twilight sky") dilute momentum; "honey and regret" taste lacks sensory plausibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Transforms ferry-guide trope through ticket punch mechanics, but "veiled ridgeway" feels derivative. Emotional truth in Jorin’s quiet growth is specific, yet premise lacks bold risk—safety-middle hedging avoids deeper moral calculus about "unused courage."</comment>
