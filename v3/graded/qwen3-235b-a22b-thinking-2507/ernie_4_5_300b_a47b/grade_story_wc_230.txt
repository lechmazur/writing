<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation (cultivating safety) is clear and embodied in truffle work, but internal conflict lacks depth; her flawless use of the glass eye avoids genuine struggle with its moral cost, weakening earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures stakes via "occlude with truth," but cost remains abstract—Jorn’s fear dissipates too neatly without visible sacrifice, undermining conceptual weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ravine orchard’s storms pressure choices (hurrying to oak), while the glass eye’s physicality charges the final image; "damp soil" and "crack of thunder" anchor sensory urgency without checklist padding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal safety to societal truth-telling via Jorn’s ledger, but resolution lacks tangible cost—Mara’s hope feels unearned as no sacrifice (e.g., destroying the ledger) concretely narrows options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through truffles (safety) and the eye (truth), but "safety isn’t just a feeling—it’s a choice" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting the non-literal resonance of the final calm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct ("methodical grace," "lies curdled in air"), with stress-appropriate compression during the storm; Jorn’s fragmented dialogue ("They’re coming for me") reveals paranoia without over-articulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic ("orchard hung... like a chandelier of green"), but "truth curdled in the air" mixes metaphors, slightly muddling clarity in a high-pressure beat near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of truffle foraging and empathy virus avoids tropes, with "occlude" as bold reframing of truth-telling; risks heighten stakes but the ledger’s convenient resolution undercuts ingenuity’s payoff.</comment>
