<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied guilt ("gnawed") avoids therapy-speak. Final apology choice earned by projection scene showing farmer's hesitation, with visible cost in surrendering editorial control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "courage to let it bend him" crystallizes stance shift with conceptual cost (abandoning control fantasy). Orientation established immediately; causal lens holds with "because/therefore" chain from edited logs to anomaly resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Anomaly functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (gravity flickering forces "trust the web"). Pen's final "humming softly" charges closure image while the soil's gravity resistance directly shapes Elias's realization about nurturing seeds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fixing timeline edit) tightens through Lira's projection revealing alternatives, forcing trade-off between control and collaboration. Cost legible in "editing history wasn't about erasing mistakes" realization, with agency driving Elias's walk to the farmer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "turning them into seeds" reweights "contingent relationships" without moralizing. Final fever break provides non-literal answer to central question, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity of unintended consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "prismatic shards that prickled skin" not just visual effects. Compression ("Three days prior...") anchors present guilt; Lira's dialogue carries subtext through implication ("Don't thank me. Thank the web").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "guilt gnawed" and "fever broke" demonstrate high-density propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("history resented being pruned"), with final line's concrete action avoiding closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms timeline-editing trope through specific mechanics: pen as listening tool, "contingent relationships" as solution. Emotional truth in "confidently uncertain" mantra feels earned, with anomaly's "strange comfort" providing fresh inflection on redemption.</comment>
