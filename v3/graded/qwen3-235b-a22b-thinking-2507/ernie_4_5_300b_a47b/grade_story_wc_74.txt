<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied exhaustion ("fingers smudging charcoal") and contradictory hope drive the brush-handing micro-choice. Only slight abstraction in "the ache in Mr. Voss's voice" slightly mars embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the empty brush and "didn't need to" crystallize earned cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density ("saffron quiet" reweighting smog) with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse grime actively constrains moonlight access, enabling the pivotal eye-painting beat. Brush-as-micro-setting charges closure ("fanned like a starfish"), satisfying 9+ gate through causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lila's agency—painting Elena's eyes from Mr. Voss's voice—narrowing options to handing over the brush. Cost is visceral (97-hour insomnia resolved by emotional satiety), though moonlight's role in "rousing" feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"To love is to translate" emerges organically from Mr. Voss's lesson, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("light lingered, a quiet rebellion") reweights smog with conceptual cost without stating theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("orchids bloomed like defiant lips") and rhythmic control shine, though "methodically hopeful" borders on tell-y abstraction before cataloging action redeems it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence propels ("A clang echoed... Lila sat up"). Final line crystallizes motif without muddle. Figurative language precise ("blisters tipped with silver like frost") in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "lost language" trope through painterly lens (kindness as fossil-cataloging). Smog as "burnt copper" taste and brush's physicality create irreplaceable specificity that heightens stakes.</comment>
