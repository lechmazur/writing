<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "chaotically precise" hands trembling yet focused; embodied cost in "taste of defeat like ash" bleeding into mirror. Slight over-articulation of synaptic plasticity theory risks diagnostic label-speak but redeemed by physical stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: laser activation directly causes memory flood, forcing dial adjustment with visible cost ("canyon seemed to swallow him"). Earned Stasis closure crystallizes when transformed mirror reflects mosaic memories, foreclosing safe experimentation path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Broken mirror as micro-setting constrains every choice—from soldering to laser etching—and charges the final mosaic image. Canyon's shifting symbols could pressure more actively, but moonlight's prism effect is purposefully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (entangle memories without self-loss) tightens when feedback loop threatens overwhelm; protagonist's dial adjustment forecloses safe experimentation with visceral cost ("memories bleeding into the mirror's"). Agency-driven escalation under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "fractures weren't flaws, they were pathways" becomes literal memory channels. Final mosaic image offers resonant answer to "archeologist of abandoned dreams" without moralizing—cost felt in swallowed canyon imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded engineer wired for fractal patterns") modulates under stress: clinical syntax compresses to visceral fragments during feedback loop. Minor register drift in "synaptic plasticity" repetition, but rhythm control elevates pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "shards glinting like shattered constellations" avoids cliché through specificity. "Liquid mercury" to "liquid light" maintains coherent physical logic. Peak-beat compression ("Kael gritted his teeth...") heightens without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: synaptic plasticity applied to objects transforms trope into specific causality. "Archaeologist of abandoned dreams" avoids sentimentality via tech precision. Emotional truth in failure-as-catalyst feels lived, not template-driven.</comment>
