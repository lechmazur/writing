<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Lira's curiosity battles fear during descent ("prickle of curiosity" vs "hands trembling"). Final renunciation of certainty ("absence of answers") is earned through psychometry visions, but "hinged awakenings" concept slightly abstracts internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "tasted the edge of the unknowable" crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density builds to the hum's undeniable pressure, though factory shutdown timeframe lacks temporal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Petrichor jars constrain choices (guiding the delve) and charge closure through reweighted labeling ("Subterranean Lagoon, After the Factory Shuts Down"). Lagoon's silt physically alters tactics during wading, meeting 9+ gate via environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Lira's psychometry agency: expedition visions narrow options toward conceptual cost. The compass malfunction crystallizes stakes with felt price ("expedition hadn’t vanished—they’d crossed"), though factory shutdown timeframe doesn’t tighten decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through petrichor’s transformation from "memory of land" to "edge of unknowable." Final hum offers non-literal answer without moralizing, though "hinged awakenings" concept slightly over-explains early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "air grew cooler, sweeter" filters setting through her collector’s bias. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during compass spin), avoiding abstraction despite one slightly tell-y interior moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "compass grew heavier" does triple duty (object, tension, psychometry). Final line’s "hum" avoids overwriting while charging closure. Density peaks perfectly in lagoon scene with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geological mystery and sensory quest elevates tropes. "Petrichor collector" specificity avoids abstraction ("jars labeled by date/location"), but "hinged awakenings" concept feels slightly derivative without deeper integration.</comment>
