<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "void she both feared and craved" and bloodshot eyes persisting through doubt, but off-page Elders prevent on-page micro-choices with opposition. Final renunciation (burning journals) earns cost through embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "ice groaned... spiderwebbing outward" crystallizes reconfigured stakes. Accumulative lens holds via star/lake cross-referencing, though predictive mechanics lack granular causality in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Obsidian spire actively constrains choices—thermal shifts inform modeling—and final image of journal flames dancing "like the future" charges closure through micro-setting. Tool (quill) evolves from promise to ash, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thaw vs perpetual winter) tightens through derision at equinox prediction, with Elders' silent robes paying visible cost. Agency-driven deepening via star cross-referencing under Accumulative lens, though escalation lacks secondary pressure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "data without imagination is a corpse" avoids moralizing, while abandoned quill reweights "writing the future" as earned wisdom. Final image offers non-literal answer without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spire’s jagged edges clawed at horizon") and rhythmic control under pressure, though "groundedly imaginative" drifts into academic diction during high-stakes modeling. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("quill nib scraped the parchment" advances action), but minor scaffold in star-cross-referencing sequence and "promise, or a warning" weakens metaphor. Closure image remains sharp despite isolated cadence hiccups.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ignorance cartographer" with kingfisher quill as courage conduit feels inevitable. Transformation test passed: generic scientist would break emotional logic. Bold risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
