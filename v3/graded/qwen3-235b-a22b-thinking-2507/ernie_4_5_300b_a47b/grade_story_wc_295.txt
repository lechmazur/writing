<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("avoiding others' pain" vs brother's loss) drives the pivotal choice to surrender detachment. Embodied emotion peaks when "her own grief rose to meet them, a tide finding its shore" during the temple immersion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: glyphs stabilizing into an "empathy map" crystallizes the cost of Lirael's brother's absence now transformed into shared burden. The prism's "melted silver" light pooling at dawn reconfigures the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (refracting stars into glyphs) and charges the final image (light pooling as "melted silver"). Observatory tools actively pressure decisions: sextant alignment directly enables the temple hologram projection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: Lirael's choice to "let the words wash over her" deepens the burden-density, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is legible when glyphs morph into "a lullaby in her brother's handwriting" etched into her skin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the temple's "language of shared burdens" resolves into a non-literal answer where empathy becomes a map. Avoids moralizing by having glyphs physically rewrite Lirael's skin rather than stating "grief connects us."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomy terms ("Whispering Veil," "variable stars") filter all descriptions. Rhythmic control peaks in the temple immersion ("I lost my child. I fear I'm unworthy. I miss the stars") where fragmented syntax embodies sensory overload.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "light bending through dimensions only dreamers could perceive" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Single deduction for "pen hovered over a blank page" (near-cliché) in high-pressure beat, though offset by strong subsequent action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms empathy trope through specific astronomy framework: "burdens as glyphs" and stars as "mirrors" create fresh synthesis. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via Charged Poise closure without gimmickry, though temple mechanics slightly echo familiar archetypes.</comment>
