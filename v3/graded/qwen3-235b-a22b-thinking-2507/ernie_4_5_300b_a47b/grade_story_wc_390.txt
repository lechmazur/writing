<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (logic vs. resonance) manifest in micro-choices like adjusting the resonator while kneeling on ice, but "logically emotional" trait remains stated rather than viscerally demonstrated during the ghost clash. Final renunciation of weaponizing the key earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: the ghost's vanishing crystallizes the key's purpose as bridge not weapon, with visceral cost in Elias's physical collapse and "sweat dripping into his collar." Accumulative/Textural lens holds as vibrational density peaks then resolves into harmony.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting—ice vibrations constrain tactics (kneeling to sense pulses) and charge the final image where "the ice creaked beneath him." Azure coat gains significance through sunset's "golden light clinging like a blessing," though occupational detail stays surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully as the ghost's wail forces Elias to match pitch, narrowing options to sonic harmony or annihilation. Cost manifests in physical exhaustion ("legs burned, vision blurring") and conceptual shift, but the ghost's motivation remains underdeveloped, slightly muting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sonic physics ("harmonizing frequencies") reweighted in the final line: "letting it sing" rejects weaponization without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in concrete action (resonator adjustments), though "bridge" metaphor edges toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("frosted planks," "cracked leather") with rhythmic control during stress (shortened sentences as ghost attacks). Minor register drift occurs in "sonic absolution" terminology, slightly disrupting the engineer's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in the climax with three sequential "he [verb]" constructions ("The ghost lunged... Elias activated... The wraith recoiled"), creating template cadence that dulls immediacy. Otherwise, propulsion and specificity excel, especially in sensory details like "sound slicing through his skull."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes lighthouse engineering with spectral harmony through vibrational physics, avoiding trope clichés via concrete mechanics (resonator dial adjustments). Risk-taking in conceptual closure ("bridge it well") feels inevitable, though drift-ice setting lacks deeper transformation beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
