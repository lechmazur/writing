<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lirael’s micro-choices (pocketing chain link, then using it publicly) reveal her value hierarchy, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the teaching scene; "adrift" feeling is embodied yet not actively wrestled with under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("embrace the unknown"), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens; the chain link’s reappearance reweights "unfolded horizons" with undeniable pressure at the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Benthic pressure intensifies at city edge, actively constraining movement and thought; the chain link’s physicality ("rough edges biting palms") charges the ending by embodying Lirael’s tension between grounding and expansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen when Tarel questions shifting light patterns, forcing Lirael to articulate adaptation—but pressure lacks visceral narrowing; conceptual cost ("smallness of her place") feels earned yet insufficiently embodied in the moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through geometry-as-metaphor without moralizing; "unfolded horizons" reweights from abstract fear to navigable truth in the final line, avoiding sentimentality while resonating with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("angles and lines," bioluminescent textures) modulates rhythm under pressure; minor filter-verb drift ("she felt a somber marvel") slightly dulls immediacy during the teaching climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding, though adjacent "faint, cold glimmer" and "soft glow" create subtle synonym churn; no artifacts in closure beat preserves propulsion toward the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation theory and alien geometry feels inevitable, but "balancedly curious" trait leans slightly toward template; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
