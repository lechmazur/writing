<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("tears freezing on his cheeks"), micro-choices reveal value hierarchy (sketch over relics), but epiphany lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (worldview shift crystallized in "rainbows in frost"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density buildup to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire constrains choices (melting forces descent) and charges closure (sunlight on ice); "lingering luminance" recurrence directly shapes final rainbow image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("sacred in simple") tighten through Kael's agency (pouring starlight → garden shift), cost legible in frozen tears and foreclosed quest for "impossibilities"; escalation sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through garden transformation—final rainbows reweight "cold stone" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by showing insight via action (sketch → roses), not stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dagger of frost," "brilliant dimness") with rhythmic control under pressure; sentence compression during ascent ("vapor coiled... lifting him") modulates intensity flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sunlight spilled onto the ice, casting rainbows in frost" charges closure); no figurative muddle even in peak beats like garden transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "garden folly keystone" transforms from relic to emotional conduit; specificity (stolen starlight, mother's sketch) avoids tropes while risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
