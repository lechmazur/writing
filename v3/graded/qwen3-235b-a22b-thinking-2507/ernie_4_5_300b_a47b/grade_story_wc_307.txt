<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s withholding vs. Lira’s desperation, but "wove truth carefully" remains label-like without sufficient embodied tradeoffs during high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Lira’s "becoming" realization reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost (knowledge earned through struggle), under Accumulative lens with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pond ripples function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image—fractal patterns shifting to spiral helix embodies the thematic shift, meeting Q3’s 9+ gate flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulating stone throws deepens under Accumulative lens, but temporal pressure ("days passed") lacks concrete cost escalation until Lira’s decisive throw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from ripple patterns; "becoming" reweights vanishing without moralizing. Final image’s spiral helix offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice has distinct lyrical texture ("starlight pooled like liquid mercury"), but "truth she wove carefully" verges on abstract metaphor without sufficient character-particular perceptual bias in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful fragments, but paraphrase loop in "withhold... letting it drip" / "did not speak... letting patterns unfold" slightly dulls high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of backward aging + magnetic time-bending transforms tropes; "vanishing as appearing" feels inevitable through ripple mechanics without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
