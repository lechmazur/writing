<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lumen’s "incisively kind" telepathy manifests through embodied contradictions (stone warmth vs. sharpness), but Mara’s emotional shift from fear to acceptance lacks messy irrationality; her grandmother’s sacrifice insight feels earned though rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Mara’s drinking reconfigures the garden’s meaning with conceptual cost—but the "shuddering" effect lacks concrete sensory proof of sacrifice, weakening cost legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Liquid starlight" overwrites the high-pressure drinking beat, and "threaded fingers" implies simultaneity for sequential actions; minor but dulls closure’s propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms underwater city trope via bioluminescent lab twist, but garden setting leans generic; grandmother’s metamorphosis feels inevitable yet fresh in hindsight.</comment>
