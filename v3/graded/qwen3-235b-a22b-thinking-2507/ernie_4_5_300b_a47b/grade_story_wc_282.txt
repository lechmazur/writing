<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation ("voice of the unknown") is embodied through tactile choices (algae touch, journal sketches), but internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her transition from cartographer to translator lacks struggle against a flaw, reducing earnedness of the final stance despite strong sensory specificity in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the spores dissolving into Lira’s skin reconfigures her identity with visceral cost (fossil’s disintegration), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts ("colors blurred into radiant white") that narrow options toward the dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains every choice (tides guard the fossil, gust triggers hologram), while the heat-mapper’s physicality charges the climax; micro-setting details like "damp sand" and "salt-laden air" evolve causally with the fossil’s transformation to charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via sensory density (heat-mapper colors → golden spores), but pressure lacks meaningful deepening; the gust complication doesn’t raise stakes organically, and Lira’s agency feels passive as the fossil "yearns" to guide her without resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (fossil as "palimpsest," spores as "voices"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "floating through time" as earned wisdom, though the "unknown wasn’t empty" line skirts abstraction without sufficient embodied cost to fully satisfy Q5’s 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature shines ("mapper’s lenses focused on the fossil"), with rhythmic control tightening during the memory surge ("forest vast and ancient... shadow: humans"); no head-hopping, and compression (algae vial → floating leaf) is taught early and paid off in the spore transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("knelt," "dipped," "clung") and high-density imagery ("liquid storm" of spores); metaphors ("palimpsest of emotions") serve pressure without muddle, though "factually mystical" slightly drifts into thematic label in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transitional objects feel fresh through specific integration (fossil as portal requiring algae touch), but the "voice of the unknown" premise leans on familiar eco-mysticism; emotional truth elevates it, though not quite transforming tropes enough for 9+ risk distinction.</comment>
