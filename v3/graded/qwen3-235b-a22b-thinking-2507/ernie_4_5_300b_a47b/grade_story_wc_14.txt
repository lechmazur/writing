<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses under pressure; micro-choices lack friction despite precise actions. "Earnestly studious" trait remains untested label without tradeoffs during the hum climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof test; "enduring magic of time" abstracts conceptual price. Accumulative lens holds but final image lacks undeniable legibility of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bonsai textures and lamp hum function as micro-setting that charges closure: notepad’s growth embodies constrained choice. Final image’s "tapestry of light and shadow" reweights prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation via hum’s intensification drives agency, but cost remains conceptual vapor. "Felt cost" requirement unmet—Althea’s smile obscures stakes despite townsfolk’s awe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Final paragraph’s "beauty of restraint" moralizes, violating earned resonance. Theme emerges from bonsai textures but closure’s abstract testament replaces non-literal answer with stated philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in texture-focused noticing; rhythmic control sustains accumulative lens. "Incandescent restraint" lexicon stays character-particular through climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure beat’s "enduring magic of time" muddles cost with abstraction. Figurative strings in final paragraph dull propulsion where density should peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-keeping via lamp hum and bonsai textures. "Violet-pine sap paste" specificity transforms stationer trope without gimmickry.</comment>
