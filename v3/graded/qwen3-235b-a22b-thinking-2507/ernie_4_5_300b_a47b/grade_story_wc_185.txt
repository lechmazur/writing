<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not banished the noise, but found quiet within it" with embodied cost (ribs aching → relief). No diagnostic labels; micro-choices like tracing Braille-like cracks reveal hierarchy of values. Minor flaw: flaw depth lacks specific blindness beyond general struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "not banished the noise" crystallizes stance with visible cost ("ribs no longer aching" after earlier agony). Causal lens holds perfectly—ice spiral application directly triggers bloom. Orientation clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice cracks function as micro-setting that constrains choice (thicker ice/spiral pattern dictates method) and charges final image (bloom sinks into spiral). Sensory detail selective—"frozen lightning" fractures embody memory without tourist cataloging. Environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: hum intensifies → she focuses on spiral → bloom materializes. Cost legible in physical toll ("teeth ached; ears rang" → "ribs no longer aching"). Dominant stake (silence vs dissonance) signaled early and tightened through causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: final "duet of hush and hum" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states the thesis. Resonant non-literal answer to "can noise/silence coexist?" through concrete particulars (bloom sinking into ice).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fossilized echo," "frozen lightning" filter POV bias. Rhythmic control under pressure—shorter sentences during hum crescendo ("Teeth ached; ears rang"). Elision (beings' arrival) taught early; no head-hopping. Voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shattering ancient hymns" shows not tells dissonance. High density: "petals like pressed glass" conveys bloom’s nature efficiently. Final line recharges motif without muddle. Cost shown via physical detail ("ribs no longer aching") not abstract telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "magical solution" trope through specific mechanics (ice cracks as Braille, bloom as void-swallowing noise). Emotional truth in "finding quiet within noise" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric prose) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; fresh angle on balance.</comment>
