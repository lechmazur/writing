<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied emotion ("throat tightened," "tears pricking") but "ache in her chest" edges toward cliché. Micro-choices like rewinding the film reveal values under pressure, though the final whisper lacks sufficient contradictory impulse to hit 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Mara's commitment to uncovering secrets forecloses passive searching with visible cost (tears, lilac scent). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds through sensory accumulation to crystallize stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Projection booth constrains every choice (kneeling by canister, table for film) and charges closure ("lobby creaked as building approved"). Dust, film strip, and crystal function as micro-settings that actively shape tactics and final image, exceeding 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Mara realizes letters are literal, not metaphorical. Agency drives escalation via rewinding film, with cost (emotional vulnerability) legible in tears and lilac scent. One deepening suffices, but the cost could feel more consequential for her future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of "unused love waiting to be noticed" emerges purely through particulars—the hidden letters, film strip, lilac scent—without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: secrets become purpose, not relics, with conceptual cost felt in her tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lattice of memories") and rhythmic control elevate tension. "Hushed thunder" motif modulates perfectly with pressure. Minor register drift in "throat tightened" prevents 9.5+, but elision (flashbacks) is taught and paid off flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character. "Rain began to fall in a hushed thunder that matched the ache in her chest" exemplifies triple-duty prose. No figurative muddle—density intensifies under pressure without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry as emotional archaeology avoids ghost-story tropes. "Unused love" concept transforms cliché into literal, physical stakes. Risk-taking (lyric closure) heightens coherence, but the crystal gazer trope lacks total novelty to breach 9.5.</comment>
