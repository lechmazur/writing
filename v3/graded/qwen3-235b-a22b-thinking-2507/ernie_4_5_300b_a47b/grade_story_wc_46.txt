<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (stillness vs consumption) drives choice; embodied emotion in polishing motions; micro-choice of selecting the pitted shard reveals value hierarchy. Final release lacks visible cost—no sacrifice shown when sharing the light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (pearl dissolving into sky with child/elder reactions) reconfigures "stillness" with conceptual cost. Orientation solid by word 10. Lens ambiguity cap avoided—Accumulative/Textural pressure via sensory density holds. Cost legibility slightly soft (no tangible forfeiture).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto’s black water constrains choice (testing pearl’s reflection); meteorite iron tool shapes polishing tactics. "Zephyr bloom" fragrance charges final image. Sensory specificity (ozone/jasmine, prismatic flecks) avoids cliché while mirroring internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) signaled early but lacks escalation—internal conflict resolves via reflection alone. No meaningful tightening: "stillness" epiphany emerges from memory, not protagonist-driven pressure. Cost implied (releasing the pearl) but not dramatized as a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from sea glass transformation: light as loan, not gift. Final image (pearl dissolving, child’s laugh) offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality—stillness as "space between heartbeats" deepens through action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "constellations only she could decipher," "mist’s moisture refracting into prismatic flecks." Rhythmic control in climax ("It cast no shadow, yet its light seeped..."). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via memory shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "clinked softly as she sifted" shows action. Sentence propulsion peaks in closure: "The pearl drifted upward, dissolving into the sky." Minor figurative muddle in "zephyr bloom" prevents 9.5, but closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "pearl of stillness" trope through sea glass pragmatism and meteorite iron. Emotional truth in rough-edged shard remaining—avoids tidy resolution. Specificity (birch bark note, twin-shell scale) grounds universality without quirk.</comment>
