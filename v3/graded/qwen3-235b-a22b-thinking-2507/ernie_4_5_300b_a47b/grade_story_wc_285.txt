<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("distill complexity into essence") stated but not pressure-tested; Thaddeus observes without active choices, lacking contradictory impulses under stress. Final endurance lacks visceral cost beyond philosophical acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: Thaddeus carries his "layer forward" amid the palimpsest promise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density, but cost feels abstract rather than felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing functions as essential micro-setting: disorientation pays off in closure’s "palimpsest promise" image. Yarn needle constrains methodology, but environment doesn’t actively pressure tactical choices under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving layered promise) deepen through sensory accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. No live option foreclosed; cost remains conceptual without tangible trade-off altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through palimpsest/needle motifs; final image reweights "weaving into next crossing" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite philosophical language, though "distill complexity" borders on prompt-like abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fog rolled in like a second skin" filters through Thaddeus’s reflective lens. Minor register drift ("percolate through ambient awareness") slightly jars against otherwise consistent voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentence rhythm varies perfectly with fog’s moods. One hairline slip: "ambient awareness" feels corporate in peak observation beat, but doesn’t obscure closure’s crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman/philosopher via textile metaphors; "palimpsest promise" transforms river-crossing trope. Risk-taking in prioritizing texture over plot pays off cohesively without gimmickry.</comment>
