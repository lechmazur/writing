<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize in the photo offering—Elara’s history of taking versus giving her own memory—earning the closure choice with embodied cost (wilted lily, transformed photo). No stock phrasing; "gloves slick with sweat" concretizes tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "destiny’s door wasn’t locked. It was a garden" reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost (wilted lily, guard’s obliviousness). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as the jar "hummed, content to wait."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lily functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (disabling the grate) and charging closure (blackened petals symbolizing fair trade). "Velvet curtain" and "pressure-sensitive floor" integrate action with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the jar demands reciprocity, forcing Elara’s agency (offering the photo). Guard’s dozing slightly eases escalation, but cost legibility (wilted lily) elevates the climax’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: stealing illuminated moments versus leaving "something better." Final image ("laughter now a beacon") answers the central question without moralizing, resisting tidy resolution via the jar’s hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("golden-hour portrait thief") and rhythmic control shine, but "quietly savvy" leans toward label in peak stress. Voice modulates perfectly from tense heist to luminous wonder.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops, but "casting amber streaks" risks simultaneity error. High density falters slightly in "reinterpreted the rules" (elevated diction), though final image’s "wind chimes" metaphor resonates cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thief archetype with "illuminated moments" avoids tropes. Risk-taking (flower codes as heist tool) heightens stakes, but emerald station’s ornamental description limits specificity. Transformation test passes.</comment>
