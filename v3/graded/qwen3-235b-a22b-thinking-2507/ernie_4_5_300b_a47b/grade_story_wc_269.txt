<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s tapping ritual embodies contradictory impulses (grief/resistance) with concrete micro-choices; Kael’s abrupt shift from skeptic to believer lacks sufficient pressure-driven causality despite the closure’s earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—"corals bleeding white no more" reconfigures healing as transformation—but the storm’s bioluminescent coordinates feel coincidental rather than earned under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The solar-panel station, torn atlas page, and coral reefs actively constrain choices; the final image of "corals glowing like embers" charges closure through micro-setting specificity and environmental evolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Kael dismisses "ghost data," forcing Lira’s solo storm confrontation; cost is felt via the abandoned station, but the plankton coordinates resolve the mystery with minimal protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral metamorphosis ("paths were not lost—they were waiting"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights fossil fuel ban as "a beginning, not an end" with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature ("tapping a language only she understood") and rhythmic prose under pressure excel; slight register drift in "periodically eternal" momentarily distances voice during high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, but "periodically eternal" repetition creates paraphrase redundancy; "bleeding white" motif avoids muddle yet slightly over-tells the coral transformation in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms climate tropes via "paths disappearing" as gateways; fossil fuel ban’s unintended consequence feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry.</comment>
