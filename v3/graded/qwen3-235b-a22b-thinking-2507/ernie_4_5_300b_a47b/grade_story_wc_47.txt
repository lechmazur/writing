<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied contradiction: Lila's "flushed" vulnerability amid raw grief after viral fallout, then unclasping the pendant despite "afraid to lose him twice." No therapy-speak; obsidian shard makes loss visceral. Final choice earned by drip-pattern reframing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: planting sapling crystallizes options with visible cost ("weight of the pendant lighten"). Accumulative lens holds—drip pattern density reweights grief from chaos to "building’s heartbeat." Cost proof: conceptual shift in "healing wasn’t about erasing the past."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: server racks cradle terrariums, drip stains dictate stone placement. Final image charges closure—pendant catching "mosslight" as sapling takes root where obsidian was exposed. No generic description; moss growth literally alters visibility and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear of losing brother twice) tightens via Elias reframing drip pattern as "heartbeat," forcing Lila’s vulnerability. Protagonist agency drives escalation: unclasping pendant exposes inner layers. Cost is felt in weight shift and conceptual surrender—"expanding his story" over preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grafting botany: sapling planted where drip pattern was offers non-literal answer—growth requires merging past/present. Avoids moralizing; "honeyed hush" shifts from suffocating to "protected vulnerability" through concrete stakes (viral fallout), not abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes Lila’s grief: notices "jagged map of stains," "honeyed hush." Syntax modulates under pressure—fragmented ("Or reactive?") then flowing as healing dawns. Elias’ botanical precision ("east to west, based on sun’s angle") contrasts her rawness without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels: "snow fell, but the garden held its heat" compresses setting/emotion/closure. Figurative language sparse but potent ("honeyed hush... thick as syrup"). No overwriting—pendant’s "resin’s still there. Obsidian, too. Now life growing" charges climax without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: data center as living memorial transforms grief tropes. Specificity elevates—obsidian shard from accident site, viral fallout’s "hollow condolences." Avoids sentimentality via botanical rigor; "grafting isn’t permanent. It’s a conversation" reframes healing as active dialogue.</comment>
