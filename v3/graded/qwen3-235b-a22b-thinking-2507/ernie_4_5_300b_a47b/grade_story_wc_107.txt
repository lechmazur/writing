<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in narrating tasks ("absurd, yet they lent weight"), but micro-choices under pressure lack density; the pivotal bookmark reexamination lacks a visible trade-off despite earned closure through backstory resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise—schematics discovery and sunbeam-aligned bookmark crystallize abandonment’s cost—but the conceptual price ("heart less frozen") feels slightly abstract versus the visceral ice melt; orientation anchors cleanly within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the bookmark’s crack constrains choice (driving Kael’s reexamination) and charges the final image ("even broken things can catch the light"), transforming from flaw to rebirth symbol without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the thaw’s progression (ice revealing compartment), but the dominant pressure—abandoning perfection—relies on reflection rather than immediate environmental coercion; cost is felt yet under-embodied in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the bookmark’s crack evolves from "failure" to "map" without moralizing, and the final line reweights abandonment as "room for rebirth" with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice distinctively filters the world through a glassblower’s tactile sensitivity ("calloused fingers," "molten silica"), though the "thoughtfully spirited" label slightly drifts into abstract diagnosis during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose maintains propulsion with vivid specificity ("drip of melting ice, each drop echoing like a ticking clock"), but "heart less frozen" edges toward cliché, dulling the closure’s emotional precision by 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms abandonment tropes through glassblowing’s physics—cracks as redirection—and the "inquiry zones" premise feels inevitable in hindsight; emotional specificity avoids generic resilience narratives.</comment>
