<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in carpenter's tactile perception ("boots scuffing... softly as mouse’s whispers"), but limited external conflict reduces pressure on micro-choices despite strong embodied emotion in singing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (silence as "beginning"), but wind bells' time-warping feels convenient rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "edges biting like promise" but lens clarity slightly fuzzy pre-midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned train setting actively constrains choices (ivy-hidden door, floorboard search) and charges final image; "misting hush" evolves from oppressive to playful as environmental pressure, with wildflowers reconfiguring meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding beauty in quiet) tightens through singing climax, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation—wind bells' chime conveniently reveals door without prior struggle, missing one key tightening beat under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "halo fragment" charging closure; avoids moralizing but secondary stake ("unlocking secrets") underdeveloped, slightly muddying thematic focus on silence-as-potential versus literal key function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whispering gleam" voice, tool-focused noticing) with rhythmic control; minor POV leakage in "time stretched, warping like old film" momentarily exceeds carpenter's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("Elio paused, listening. The sound wasn’t just noise—it was a map") but opening scaffold ("the kind that clung to old wood...") slightly dulls momentum; no closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-potential via carpenter’s craft, but "hidden oasis" trope lacks sufficient transformation; emotional specificity elevates it, though proximity to common renewal motifs caps ingenuity.</comment>
