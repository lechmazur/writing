<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's "quietly driven" trait manifests in concrete micro-choices (ignoring elders, chipping the crack) with embodied emotion ("hands trembled"), though "cold sweat broke out" edges toward cliché without sufficient novelty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively with the gate revelation's conceptual cost, and causal escalation (whistle → crack → journal → shells shifting) holds flawlessly under the Causal lens from midpoint through collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shell-city micro-setting constrains every choice (fracture discovery, pattern navigation) and charges the final image as shells "shift" with "seawater" gush, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency (playing whistle improvises, chipping crack) to the journal's revelation, with the city's collapse providing unmistakable physical cost that reweights the dominant "why are watchers moving" stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through the pattern language's transformation from communication tool to countdown, with the final realization ("keep us in") reweighting the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct cartographer perceptual signature ("traced grooves," "fracture widened") and stress-appropriate rhythm ("The shells did. They began to shift") falter slightly in "cold sweat broke out," a borderline cliché in peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("air tasted of salt and iron") with clear propulsion, though "cold sweat broke out" in the tunnel scene edges into stock phrasing without sufficient textural novelty for peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms turtle-city trope through the pattern language as countdown mechanic, with the gate revelation creating non-obvious moral calculus (entrapment as protection) that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
