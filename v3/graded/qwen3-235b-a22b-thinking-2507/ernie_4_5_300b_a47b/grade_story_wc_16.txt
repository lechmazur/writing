<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("carefully reckless") manifests in micro-choices (ignoring warnings to work late), but "symphonies of truth" concept risks abstractness; embodied emotion strong ("throat tighten") though trust epiphany borders on diagnostic label-speak without sufficient struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: "heart a river finally unblocked" crystallizes stance with felt cost (years of silence), but archive-to-sister transition lacks causal pressure; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via linguistic pattern accumulation, though "before paths diverge" motif feels slightly over-deployed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: glass ink well (etched runes, half-empty state) constrains choices and charges final image; archive pressure manifests through tangible resources (tax records, prayer book) that alter tactics, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust restoration) tightens via linguistic work, but sister conflict remains off-page; pressure accumulates through "interconnected promises" method, though cost feels deferred rather than viscerally paid on the page during reconciliation attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through linguistic mechanics ("vows built on trust"), avoiding moralizing; final image ("hearts speak in language of belonging") reweights silence as language without stating thesis, though "symphonies of truth" concept leans slightly abstract in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mind like a labyrinth," linguistic diction) sustains under pressure; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity ("fingers moving with reckless precision"), though "symphonies of truth" phrasing briefly drifts toward academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "mothball-scented vault" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor paraphrase loop in backstory ("before paths diverged, before silence...") triggers -0.2, but closure beats remain clean with strong verbs ("unsnarled," "clutched").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic anthropology and emotional repair; "interconnected promises" method transforms tropes through specific, verifiable details (hydronyms, mead recipes). Avoids safety middle with morally ambiguous estrangement.</comment>
