<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "shrewdly innocent" gaze vs. passive reflection weakens agency; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite strong embodied emotion in coral-tracing scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("sharp things carve new paths"), but anesthetic timeframe's causal role in pressure escalation remains ambiguous past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brain coral constrains choices (tracing doodles, table placement) and charges final image; mist/condensation details evolve causally with emotional state without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through scribble decryption, but "after anesthetic" timeframe fails to tighten decisions; cost feels conceptual without tangible tactical alteration from initial collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through coral/cast mirroring; avoids moralizing but "shared anxieties into shared hope" risks slight abstraction in final paragraph without deeper character-specific cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lotus-hearted ache," reef-song translations) modulates rhythm under stress; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's crystallized imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks ("she wondered," "she realized") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; otherwise exceptional density with no figurative muddle in closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coral regrowth as peace metaphor feels inevitable; avoids tropes through specific child-cast interplay, though "ocean whispers back" edges toward familiar lyricism.</comment>
