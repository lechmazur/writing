<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s embodied contradiction—walking backwards to avoid mirror truths while mentoring resilience—drives her final choice to guide the woman. No diagnostic label-speak; cost is visceral in her "heart lightening" after confronting exile’s emotional labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the shadow "ready to break free" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (retracing avoided steps). Accumulative lens holds through light/shadow density, though the "reversible exile" concept lacks causal traction in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The trapped shadow constrains choice (tea leaf geometry dictates "walk backwards") and charges the final image. Library’s damp parchment and ivy-shiver establish micro-setting that pressures stillness as survival tactic, but mirror shard lacks active constraint at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lirael’s tea leaf ritual—agency-driven deepening where geometry "shows a convergence." Cost is legible in "confront what you’ve avoided," but escalation leans slightly on thematic resonance over tangible pressure shifts in the woman’s dilemma.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: the shadow’s shift reweights "reversible exile" as emotional labor, not abstraction. Final line’s "quietest lessons were the loudest" avoids moralizing by crystallizing prior particulars—no thematic echo, pure earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber sunlight trapped between panes") sustains under pressure, but "combative tenderness" is told not shown in dialogue. Rhythmic control in swing "hush" elevates atmosphere, though psychic distance wavers slightly during tea leaf reading.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "leaves shift, their shapes rearranging into constellations" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor filter verb ("her mind already racing") in high-pressure beat, but closure image ("shadow stretching, thinning") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through "walking backwards" as literal/emotional path and tea geometry as divination. Fresh synthesis: resilience as stillness charged by library’s quiet, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
