<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("find where broken promises heal") remains abstract; "respectfully rebellious" told not shown. Final choice lacks contradictory impulses—Elias acts decisively without visible internal trade-off during bottle handoff.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands: border unchanged but "brittle hush" becomes "promise" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds, but cost legibility falters—dawn's "lighter air" lacks concrete felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting: machines constrain solace-seeking and charge closure (glowing softly post-storm). Bottle’s physicality ("cold and slick") directly enables the climax’s cause/effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (smuggling bottle), but escalation lacks visible cost escalation—soldiers lowering guns feels coincidental, not earned by protagonist’s actions under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through storm’s "link[ing] absences," avoiding moralizing. Nearly stumbles with "healing wasn’t in grand gestures" (told insight), but saved by final image reweighting "brittle hush" as promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice has distinct texture ("neon veins pulsing like a wound stitched with light"), but peak-beat compression undercuts pressure—Elias’s "rebellious" trait lacks idiosyncratic lexicon during drone handoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "raw, electric fury that shook the ground" + "sky split open" + "lightning forked" in 3 lines dilutes impact. Template cadence ("He’d always...") dulls immediacy near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "mailman" trope through disputed territory lens and bottle’s magical realism. Fresh inflection: storm as "question" linking absences avoids cliché, though "brittle hush" risks overuse.</comment>
