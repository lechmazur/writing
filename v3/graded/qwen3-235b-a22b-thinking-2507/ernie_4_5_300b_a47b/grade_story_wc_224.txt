<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s embodied motivation ("need to understand the shape of home") drives visceral micro-choices like trembling with the feather. Contradictory impulses—avoiding pain yet craving truth—intensify through the stone’s activation. Orin’s minimal presence avoids relationship depth, but her mercury skin’s physicality anchors emotional stakes. Final renunciation of forgetting earns closure through shattering cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: stone shatters, embedding shards as Lirael redefines "home" through enduring others’ memories. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density (feather dissolving into stardust). Orientation anchors by line 15 with bookstore/mountain. Minor lens ambiguity in cavern transition prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mercury skin functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (shards embedding) and charging the final image ("flecked with obsidian"). Bookstore’s "shelves spiraled like roots" offers vivid texture but remains backdrop, not active pressure. Bioluminescent fungi in cavern lacks causal role—environment shapes one key turn but not tactics. Misses 9+ gate by narrow margin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory pain vs. need to remember) tightens via feather-seeding action, narrowing options to endure or flee. Cavern earthquake escalates via coincidence (rocks tumbling), slightly undercutting protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Shards embedding provides visceral cost, but quake feels externally imposed. One decisive deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Home is in the act of remembering" emerges organically from stone’s shattering, avoiding thematic echo. Final line ("seed the world with truth") reweights "buried talents" through action (feather dissolving), not moralizing. No forced binaries; complexity lies in bearing others’ memories as both burden and gift. Resonant closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "shelves spiraled like roots" filters world through Lirael’s glass-refracted vision. Rhythmic control falters in "low hum... hidden thunder"—uncharacteristic of her voice, disrupting psychic distance. No head-hopping; tension modulates via syntax ("She closed her eyes and whispered"). Feather texture’s lingering detail shows pressure-appropriate compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies" and "bioluminescent fungi" verge on generic fantasy tropes, diluting specificity. No scaffold loops, but "hidden thunder" creates a minor mixed metaphor (thunder isn’t hidden). Final image’s propulsion ("peak glowed silver light") compensates. Figurative muddle in one peak beat blocks 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magic artifact" trope via mercury skin as lock/stone as mirror. Fresh inflection: "shape of home" as active remembering, not place. Avoids derivative safety through specific costs (shards, borrowed memories). Feather-seeding method synthesizes linguistics with emotional risk. Near-echo of "Age of Echoes" slightly undermines novelty.</comment>
