<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority concrete ("tension in shoulders," "breath caught") but lacks contradictory impulses during revelation; epiphany feels earned yet untested by struggle. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond internal shift, missing Q1 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Charged Poise ("silence had always been waiting... learn how to listen") with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through vibration monitoring deepening. Minor deduction: cost remains abstract despite legible final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism terrace actively pressures choices (market noise vs. garden stillness), while storm glass functions as micro-setting constraining tactics. Final image ("blade cutting through dark") charges closure through prior vibration motif, satisfying Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through textural escalation as noise monitoring deepens into silence revelation. Agency via observation alone is sufficient for Accumulative lens, but external pressure remains underdeveloped despite conceptual cost being unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: storm glass vibrations refracting noise into silence’s "music in its pause." Final image reweights "teach silence" premise without moralizing, achieving Q5 9+ quick test through resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid fractals," "shrapnel" for voices) with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. Slight register drift in "fluidly logical" disrupts voice cohesion, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise exemplary focalization under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lap of water against hull" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language ("vaulting hush enveloped her") enhances rather than obscures pressure. Micro-deduction for "clouding or clearing to indicate turbulence" slightly abstract in one mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "silence" trope through vibration physics and gondola operator lens; "dancing with noise" avoids genericity. Emotional specificity strong but epiphany structure slightly familiar, missing Q8 9+ requirement of non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
