<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in avoiding mother’s locket versus weaving obsidian’s pain, but emotional layering lacks irrational depth during peak stress (e.g., no self-deception in locket decision). Embodied choices under pressure—sweat on temples, flame adjustments—anchor motivation credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("some burdens meant to stay buried"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through density increase. Orientation is immediate ("bronze grotto under starlight"), and cost proof is legible in the locket’s untouched state at the grotto’s exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bronze grotto actively constrains choices: starlight angles dictate lamp orientation, drafts extinguish flames, and calcified niches force tactile engagement. Micro-setting (kerosene burner’s wick) charges the final image packed "into his belt," meeting 9+ gate requirement decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: Kael’s reorientation of the lamp cracks resistant obsidian, narrowing options through earned skill. Cost is unmistakable in trembling hands and the thematic weight of leaving his mother’s burden, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural deepening under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the fractal metaphor—"collected the weights, not the wounds"—with the final image of shifting satchel fractals offering resonant closure. Avoids moralizing while reweighting burden-bearing via Kael’s earned restraint at his mother’s niche.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of wet metal," "shingled hush") filters all details through Kael’s tactile, burden-focused lens. Rhythmic control under stress ("too much heat... too little") avoids head-hopping, with patterned elision (mother’s backstory) paid off in the locket’s avoidance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or tension ("mist of silver dust," "fractals shifted... restless spirits"). Final line’s "burdens were safe, for now" delivers closure without figurative muddle, though "sickly green" slightly strains specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms magical burden tropes through specific mechanics: fractal weaving, orientation physics, and calcified whispers. Emotional truth in avoiding maternal trauma feels fresh, with the grotto’s "whalebone reverie" charging stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
