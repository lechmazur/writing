<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (earth/sky pull) drives micro-choices under pressure, but "torn and whole" abstraction slightly weakens embodied conflict during the verse-writing climax where emotional specificity could deepen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (fading verse vs persistent memory), lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density increase, and the nostalgia ban's constraint shapes every tactic from moonstone application to writing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moss pulsing as "second heartbeat" and moonstone dust charging the final image constrain choice and embody stakes, though twilight garden's atmospheric details occasionally prioritize lyricism over pressure-driven specificity during the dance sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency (stealing dust → applying → writing) narrows options under ban pressure, with visible cost in burning strokes, but the single tightening lacks deeper tactical shifts that could elevate cost legibility beyond physical sensation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through verse-writing as embodied defiance against erasure, but "elective exile" resolution risks thematic echo; final "heart full of obsidian grace" slightly overstates the earned ambiguity of living in the in-between.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("obsidian grace," gaps between heartbeats) modulates rhythm under pressure; non-standard semicolons and cosmic-verse syntax taught early pay off in closure’s lyrical cadence without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, high density ("luminescent mist, bare feet sinking into moss that pulsed like a second heartbeat"), but "pulsed like a second heartbeat" edges toward bodily cliché in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms nostalgia-ban trope through tide dancer physiology and cosmic verse alchemy; "spontaneously anchored" synthesizes physical/spiritual tension organically, though elective exile concept lacks one fresh inflection beyond established lyrical sci-fi conventions.</comment>
