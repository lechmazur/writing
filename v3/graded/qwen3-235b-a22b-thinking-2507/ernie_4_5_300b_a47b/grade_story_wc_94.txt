<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as Kael's physical/emotional scars drive his poetic rarefaction; "masks slip" metaphor grounds abstract pain in embodied choice when he writes raw verses. Final renunciation of censorship earns cost through prior causality—his cracked gas mask mirroring vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: sealing the uncensored poem risks Ministry retaliation, crystallized by "let the storm kiss his wonder." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as storm density intensifies pressure, but "vigil in pause" lacks active operationalization until late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory dome’s groaning ribs constrain movement during storm, while bus timetable evolves from passive artifact to writing surface—charging final image. "Liquid mercury" clouds and clogged gas mask filter sensory detail through Kael’s urgent, ash-choked perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (censorship vs. raw truth) tightens via storm’s pressure forcing Kael’s poetic rarefaction; "furiously tranquil" crystallization shows earned trade-off. But "vigil in pause" concept remains thematic echo rather than tactical constraint until envelope reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar cartography metaphor: "map them is to rarefy the air" reweights censorship as suffocation. Final image ("storm kiss his wonder") resonates without moralizing, though "to rarefy is to hold your breath" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in ash-filtered observations ("clouds roiled like liquid mercury") and rhythmic control via darkroom timer’s "click." Voice modulates from fragmented storm descriptions to steady verse-writing cadence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "iron ribs groaning like a beast" shows textural specificity without muddle. Final line’s "raw and unfiltered" risks cliché but earns charge through prior scar imagery. Minor deduction for "furiously tranquil" bordering on label.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographer’s scar maps with poetic rarefaction avoids trope; storm-kissed wonder transforms censorship into visceral liberation. Derivative risk in "censored poet" premise offset by specific bus timetable/darkroom timer integration.</comment>
