<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action ("emptiness had grown heavier, a weight that pressed against her chest") avoids abstraction. Contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) manifest simultaneously when she touches Kael's shadow. Final endurance of vulnerability earns closure with visible cost in "burned bridges carefully" reversal. Slight abstraction in "teach suffocating to breathe" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with undeniable cost: her trembling hands and tightened grip embody the bridge-rebuilding tradeoff. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density ("ashen air," "burnt wood and starlight"). Reflection stays anchored to present via doorknocker ring micro-choices. One redundant beat in dawn description caps score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary constrains every choice—threshold humming as physical barrier, doorknocker ring as only conduit. Final image ("doorknocker ring cold between them") charges closure by reweighting emptiness as breathable. Sensory details ("iron surface pitted and scarred") serve urgency without checklist. Micro-setting (ring) drives all pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (threshold collapse vs. isolation) tightens when Kael crosses the threshold, shuddering the sanctuary. Cost is visceral: her "trembling" hands and "burned bridges" admission. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens through sensory deepening ("air thickening with burnt wood"). One abstract phrase ("possibility of breath") slightly dilutes stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: bridges burned/rebuilt reweights "emptiness" as "chance to breathe" without moralizing. Final image of ring as "silent witness" offers non-literal answer to isolation. Avoids sentimentality via concrete cost (her vulnerability). No thematic echo—Kael’s "strange way of teaching" reframes scars as necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("air tasted of old smoke"), with rhythm modulating under stress (fragmented sentences during knock). Kael’s dialogue carries subtext ("You burned that bridge") distinct from Elara’s interiority. Minor register drift in "metaphysical barrier" risks abstraction. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with threshold crossing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density: "burned bridges carefully, each severed tie a ritual" compresses backstory and motivation. Avoids loops but "fading threshold pulsed, a heartbeat in the darkness" risks cliché. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though "loaded emptiness" slightly overwrites. Final line’s specificity ("chance to breathe") avoids sentimentality. One mixed metaphor caps score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms isolation tropes via specific mechanics: thresholds fade only when touched by connection, scars as literal conduits. Emotional truth in "burned bridges carefully" ritual avoids middle-ground hedging. Fresh synthesis: "teach suffocating to breathe" crystallizes as tactile grip on Kael’s hand. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
