<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara’s tactile artistry vs procedural police work; her throat tightening at the locket embodies earned empathy without therapy-speak. Flaws (isolation, face blindness) drive choices—e.g., pocketing the ribbon—to crystallize stakes under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: mist lifting as they leave, quarry edges sharpening with the locket’s discovery. Cost is visceral—Clara *seeing* Lila for the first time. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though "opposites unified" phrasing slightly strains pattern coherence late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quarry’s mist and stone constrain choices (unstable site, ribbon’s placement), charging the final image where the ribbon "glows like a vein of blood." Sensory hierarchy—damp stone scent, charcoal texture—filters through Clara’s embodied perception without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Clara’s agency: tracing the handprint with Voss shifts knowledge from "why the ribbon?" to recognizing Lila’s humanity. Cost is the locket’s emotional weight, narrowing options toward reopening the case—escalation driven by her empathy-focused method under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Clara’s tactile process: the ribbon as "thread to her humanity" reweights the central question without moralizing. Final image (ribbon fragment framed beside portrait) resonates as a non-literal answer—truths refusing burial—avoiding thematic echo despite Clara’s closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Clara notices texture/shadow, not faces; Voss’s dialogue rasps with procedural weariness. Rhythmic control under pressure—e.g., "furrowed hush" lines—teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks as quarry details intensify.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("knelt," "brushed"). Figurative language ("mist clung like a second skin") serves pressure without muddle. Minor density issue: "frayed, dyed a faded crimson" slightly overwrites, but closure image remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Face-blind artist transforms true-crime tropes: her method (mapping chaos via texture) synthesizes sensory detail with moral stakes. Risk-taking (lyric quarry imagery driving closure) heightens coherence—Lila’s locket photo lands with visceral specificity, avoiding generic "cold case" conventions.</comment>
