<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs seeking) embodied through taste sensations; micro-choices like kneeling at the bluff show value hierarchy. Lira's late entrance slightly weakens relationship-as-crucible, but Kael's shattered worldview carries earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (shattered skepticism, "lavender and regret"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density escalates to the copper-taste climax. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff constrains choice (kneeling triggers climax) and charges final image ("world held its breath"). Tin compass as micro-setting shapes tactics. Slight deduction for aurora's role feeling ornamental in mid-scene despite strong payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding compass/weather) tightens through sensory escalation. Kael's convergence action forecloses skepticism with visible cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though forest-election urgency could heighten earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through taste motifs—final "lavender and regret" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite Lira's "absorb pain" line, which stays grounded in character voice and embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (taste-based POV) with rhythmic control: "petals trembling like moth wings" establishes voice. Stress compresses diction ("copper taste flooded mouth") without losing texture. Zero dialogue contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story. "Needle spun toward people—specific people" exemplifies high-density phrasing. Final image ("aurora dimmed... world held its breath") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of voting forests and weather-carrying humans avoids tropes through specificity (taste sensing). Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes; "terrestrially cosmic" feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
