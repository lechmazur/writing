<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "fragmented wholeness" realization; embodied emotion strong via trembling fingers and creaking joints. However, "strangely organic" label lacks sufficient physical manifestation beyond static hum, risking diagnostic-speak in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "fragmented wholeness" crystallizes options with visible cost ("joints still ached"). Magnetic storm pressure escalates causally to orb dissolution, fulfilling cost proof test via tangible physical consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass dome and solar panels constrain choices (dust cleaning, plasma torch use), charging the final image with roses catching multicolored light. Sensory hierarchy masterful—"ozone and pressed lavender" filtered through android perception anchors setting without tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single tightening through magnetic storm pressure narrows options to miniaturization. Agency-driven escalation works, but "controlled burn" concept introduced too late via memory weakens causal chain; dominant stake (contain chaos) lacks secondary pressure escalation beyond box leakage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of "static... like a song" offers resonant non-literal answer to chaos theme, reweighting "fragmented wholeness" without moralizing. Desert roses' rebirth embodies earned wisdom through concrete action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct android perceptual signature ("optics flickered," "joints creaking like old hinges") modulates with emotional intensity. Slight register drift in "resolve inner static" mantra risks corporate diction, but rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "shattering glass" sonic rhythm mirrors thematic rupture. One paraphrase loop ("not perfect—her joints still ached, and the static wasn’t entirely gone—but whole") costs 0.3 but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms android trope through desert rose farm specificity and "contained chaos" premise. Emotional truth in machine seeking balance avoids generic templates, though magnetic shift device borders on familiar sci-fi shorthand without deeper world logic.</comment>
