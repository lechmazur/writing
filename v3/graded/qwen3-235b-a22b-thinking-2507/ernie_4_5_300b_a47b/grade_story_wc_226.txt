<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "price of forgiveness" stated but not embodied through micro-choices during the ink application. Motivation clear but flaw (recklessness) doesn't compound meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("courage to let go of illusion of control") under Accumulative lens. Canyon's light-scattering reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost legible in "price of forgiveness" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Spire transitions from forbidden object to literal lens refracting light in climax, charging final image. Bone towers constrain choices (surface for ink, climbing hazard) while mist evolves from "veil" to "mirror" with causal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by sensory density ("hush fell... ground trembled... light burst") under Accumulative lens. Cost ("price of forgiveness") remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "courage to let go" tells rather than embodies the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spire's refracting function rather than moralizing. Final image ("light painted their world anew") reweights truth without stating moral, though "price of forgiveness" phrasing risks thematic echo in the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised sky," "echoes twisted") with rhythmic control during recitation. "Forged hush" registers as overwrought in peak stress but compensated by purposeful compression in "words tumbling out in a rush."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor density issues: "grudges festered like wounds" is cliché, "forged hush" mixes metaphors. No closure-tainting artifacts; strategic telling ("ritual was a lie") compresses backstory without momentum loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through refracting imagery ("truth is a kaleidoscope"). "Forgiveness as weapon" angle feels non-obvious, though moral ambiguity of elders lacks depth. Specific bone towers/spire avoid generic dystopia.</comment>
