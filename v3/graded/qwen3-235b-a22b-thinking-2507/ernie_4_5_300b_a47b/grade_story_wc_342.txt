<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s face-blindness drives concrete choices (textural perception enabling coin alignment), but final act lacks contradictory impulse—she takes the safe without visible internal friction about theft versus preservation, slightly undercutting earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the portrait remained, a testament..." crystallizes knowledge’s survival with conceptual cost (tree’s destruction), though the safe’s portability slightly dilutes tension; Accumulative lens holds via fractal density tightening to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tree’s grain constrains Lira’s art method ("mixing pigments to match oak’s grain"), charging the final constellations; micro-setting (coin’s indentations) directly enables discovery and painting, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as demolition rumble interrupts her reading, forcing rapid shift from observation to action; pressure coheres via Accumulative lens, but Lira’s agency feels reactive—she adapts rather than makes a hard choice with deeper emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "fractally precise" spirals mirroring constellations; final line ("silent hymn to limits overcome") reweights "discovering limits" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("memorized souls through textures") shapes diction under pressure; only minor slip: "she saw fractally precise patterns" uses filter verb during high-stakes discovery, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractally precise" recurs with evolving purpose, culminating in "spirals emerging as if the tree itself had breathed them"; rhythmic propulsion peaks in the painting sequence without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden library" trope through face-blind artist’s texture-based cognition; fresh inflection in mapping constellations to wood grain as preservation, resisting abstraction with verifiable detail (coin mechanics, pigment mixing).</comment>
