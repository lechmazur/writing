<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "sprout wings of patience" shows simultaneous discipline/want; but "claustrophobia dissolved" is diagnostic label-speak triggering -0.4 deduction during peak gravity inversion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the sprout reweights doll loss with conceptual cost ("planted something new"), but gravity inversion mechanics lack agency—the doll slips passively rather than testing Lila's choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Xenial trellis fails 9+ gate: described as "defied logic" but never constrains action (clinging to vines shows no physical consequence); micro-setting potential squandered despite vivid honey/wood silence imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via gravity countdown clock, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost: doll loss feels coincidental, not earned through Lila's agency (e.g., reaching recklessly), weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "silences as seeds," but final line's "stretching contracted fears into hope" states moral explicitly, triggering -0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closure beat per Q5 rules.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "silence tasted of honey," with rhythm accelerating during inversion; but "intangibly tangible" repetition violates POV lexicon under stress, drifting into academic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density in "gilded hush" passages, but "intangibly tangible" appears twice in final third as unearned thematic echo, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty that dulls closure image per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "silence as flavor" elevates claustrophobia trope, but gravity inversion premise risks derivative feel without deeper world logic; specificity in porcelain doll/sprout saves from middle-ground hedging.</comment>
