<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid through concrete details ("lenses cracked with tape," "sweat dripping into eyes"), but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—Mara unquestioningly obeys instructions without value-based hesitation, weakening the final choice's earnedness despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the spinning censer foot crystallizing options amid ghostly chants, but cost proof is slightly abstract—tears show emotional weight yet lack tangible stakes (e.g., physical exhaustion or sacrificed resources) to fully ground the "geography of loss" stakes at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The censer foot functions as essential micro-setting charging the climax, but the station itself remains atmospheric backdrop; it supplies scrap materials yet fails to constrain choices (e.g., no spatial limitations during antenna construction), missing the 9+ gate requirement for environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation through midnight calls builds pressure accumulatively, but protagonist agency feels passive—Mara executes instructions rather than making contested choices, diluting the dominant stake's urgency; cost is emotional (tears) yet not visibly tied to her actions beyond obedience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "reverse migration" as non-literal answer to navigating loss; final image of waiting ghosts reweights prior material without moralizing, though the "drowned harbors" concept leans slightly abstract without deeper integration into Mara’s specific grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("antennae like skeletal fingers," "tide dragging pebbles"), with rhythmic control tightening during construction ("soldered wires, air thick with burning insulation"); minor register drift in "patina bronze censer foot" momentarily disrupts voice authenticity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal artifacts, but paraphrase loop: "raw solace of the task" immediately followed by "sweat dripping into eyes" redundantly conveys effort; no figurative muddle, yet "drowned harbors" subtly echoes earlier "drowned by rising seas," slightly dulling closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maritime grief and memory mechanics—censer foot’s moon-linked weight transforms "reverse migration" from trope into visceral process; bold risk in using voice fragments as action ("Build it with the moon’s breath") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
