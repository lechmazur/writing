<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation remains abstract ("encrypted compassion" as goal lacks embodied stakes); no contradictory impulses shown during decryption—thrill overshadows risk. Micro-choices like tracing chain links lack visible tradeoffs; grandfather's reflection doesn't alter tactics. Final choice feels earned but cost isn't embodied beyond conceptual trust.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: message revelation crystallizes trust/fear tension with conceptual cost ("dappled resolve"). But escalation lacks protagonist agency—the amphitheater's "breath quickening" feels coincidental, not linked to her actions. Volcanic rivers' roar strains causality as simultaneous pressure without narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: surveyor’s chain constrains choices (measuring adhesive fractures) and charges the final image ("chain in her belt, its weight a comfort"). Volcanic glass simile reweights prior material, avoiding overt symbolism. Sensory details like "brass links clicking" reflect urgency without checklist overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("measure encrypted compassion") signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. External elements (amphitheater breathing, rivers roaring) don't force tactical shifts—Lira proceeds methodically without adapting to rising stakes. Cost remains conceptual; no visible price paid during decryption beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "harmonize conflicting values" crystallizes in the decrypted message, reframing vulnerability as necessary for trust. Final image ("fragile trust between strangers") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—resonance built through adhesive patterns and chain mechanics, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("adhesive’s ghost," "symphony of decryption") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass" clashes with engineer POV. No head-hopping; compression taught early via geological/musical cipher logic pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with propulsion until final third: "dappled resolve" creates mixed metaphor (shimmering + volcanic glass), dulling closure. Template cadence ("She unrolled... She measured... She traced") in decryption beat. Filter-verbs acceptable but "knew the adhesive held more than residue" tells rather than shows.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: geological cryptography transforming technical precision into emotional vulnerability. Surveyor’s chain as decryption tool feels irreplaceable and inevitable. Bold risk in making adhesive analysis resonate as thematic core without gimmickry—avoids tropes through specific, lived detail.</comment>
