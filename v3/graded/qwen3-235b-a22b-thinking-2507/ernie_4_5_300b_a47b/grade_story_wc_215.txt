<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans tell-heavy ("tranquilly perceptive," "motivation was clear") with insufficient embodied contradiction; ghost interaction lacks micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values despite strong flaw integration (silence as burden).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: shattered box and "heart light" crystallize the weight lifted; Accumulative lens holds as density builds through glass imagery to earned renunciation of silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wasteland and box constrain choices (Elias studies light/dust); hives' brittleness charges the final image. Beekeeping tools lack tactical impact but "shards glinting like stars" reweights setting with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's agency (studying box), but ghost pressure feels coincidental; "Speak" command resolves without prior tactical trade-offs, slightly muting escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through box/hive motifs without moralizing; "unspoken words waiting" avoids abstraction. Final image ("wind carried shards away") resonates non-literally but "weight lifted" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust settled in its crevices," "sun dipped low"); rhythmic control sustains compression. Ghost whispers modulate tension without POV slippage; voice remains character-bound through visceral lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("flickering shapes in the corners of his vision" – redundant imagery); otherwise clean propulsion. "Pulse, as if alive" slightly strains metaphor but pays off in closure without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wasteland solitude and spectral communication; "tangled covenant" transforms trope through specific beekeeping logic. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
