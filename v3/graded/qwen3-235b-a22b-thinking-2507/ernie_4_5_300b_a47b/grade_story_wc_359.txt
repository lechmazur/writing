<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's synesthetic interiority is concrete ("silence pooled like indigo ink") but lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; Veyra's transformation lacks sufficient on-page struggle despite credible micro-choices. Final line's thematic echo ("Sound is color. Color is truth...") risks diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the cavern's oppressive silence becomes a "hymn" with Lira's flushed cheeks and Veyra's awakened marble. Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through sensory density buildup to the aurora flare.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ice cavern actively constrains tactics (responding to sound/color) and charges the final image—stalactites reshaping into aurora-framing arches. The amber sheet functions as micro-setting, evolving from relic to proof of truth with embodied cost in Lira's resinous inhalation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory escalation: oppressive silence → chisel strike → aurora pulses. Lira's agency drives each intensification (pressing sheet to lips, singing), with visible cost in her fogged breath and flushed cheeks. The Accumulative lens makes the felt cost unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: Veyra tasting "honey and frost," the stone blooming under his touch. Ending reweights "wonder" as inevitable via the singing cavern and carving sculptor—a resonant non-literal answer avoiding moralizing despite Lira's final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines through synesthetic bias ("violet for mystery, gold for joy"), with rhythmic compression during singing ("Her voice, layered with hues... seeped into the ice"). Clean POV shift when Veyra enters, his experience filtered through Lira's lens until boots crunch on frost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line multiplies density ("frost spiraled like ghostly breath" establishes setting, voice, and pressure). Final line’s "oscillating between repose and revelation" recharges motifs without muddle. Figurative language remains coherent through the amber sheet’s evolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and sculpture: wonder manifests physically (Veyra’s marble blooming, Lira’s flushed cheeks). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off—the aurora’s "celestial harp" becomes the stone’s inner light without gimmickry.</comment>
