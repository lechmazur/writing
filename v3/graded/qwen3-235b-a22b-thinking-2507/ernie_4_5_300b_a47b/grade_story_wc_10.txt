<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s embodied trauma (trembling hands, heat-mapped grief) and micro-choices (freezing at Elias’s arrival, leaving notes) reveal contradictory impulses. Her endurance—redefining music without reclaiming voice—earns closure through prior causality, though "silently expressive" leans slightly told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "silence was not an absence but a presence" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (voice lost, new language gained). Accumulative pressure builds via sensory density (frost, thermal spikes), though the fork’s sudden sound risks coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: ice-thick walls transmit vibrations, refract light, and host dancing plants that charge the final image. Tools (tuning forks) constrain choices (joy maps better than fear), avoiding white-room syndrome through tactile, lived-in details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (proving silence’s expressiveness) tightens through Lirael’s agency: heat-mapping joy vs. fear, then the lullaby breakthrough. Cost is legible in the final tradeoff ("ocean took her voice... washed her ashore here"), though fork’s sound moment slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: ice refracting light becomes metaphor for silence refracting meaning. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—"unshaken marvels" answer the central question through dancing leaves and "captured starlight," avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: composer Lirael notices "leaves curled like musical notes" and thermal shifts as "symphony of silence." Prose rhythm modulates with stress (short phrases during capsize recall), with no head-hopping; Elias’s presence filtered through her observations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("She screamed for help..." vs. lyrical "unshaken marvels" description). Metaphors serve character ("tuning forks gleaming like captured starlight"), and final line recharges the opening with "silence was not an absence but a presence."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms trauma tropes via specific, grounded choices: heat-mapping emotions, winterglass botany, silent music. Fresh inflection—silence as active language—feels inevitable through prior particulars (frost patterns → dancing plants), avoiding safety-hedging.</comment>
