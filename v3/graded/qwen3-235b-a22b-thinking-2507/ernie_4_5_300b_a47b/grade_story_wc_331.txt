<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (librarian vs. "keeper of ghosts") with embodied emotion in scarf interaction; young patron applies secondary pressure but transformation lacks sufficient struggle escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (Eleanor's quiet confidence), but mirror-corridor transition relies on convenient atmospheric shift rather than accumulative pressure tightening under lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the scarf constrains choices (midnight ritual) and charges the final image ("seemed to whisper, Continue"), making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically from restlessness to reawakening, with agency clear in scarf ritual; minor flaw: cost (transformed perspective) feels underweighted against the magical experience's scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action (scarf geometry → poem), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "analog memories" as transformative vibration without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragile, tangible echoes") modulates with intensity, though "resonant reconfiguration" momentarily drifts into academic diction against librarian voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero artifacts in peak beats; "pages rustling like whispers" shows textural specificity, though "vibrations in the air" slightly echoes prior "tangible echoes" in adjacent paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hyperbolic geometry with library mysticism avoids tropes; emotional truth in Eleanor's quiet transformation feels inevitable through specific, verifiable details like the silk's texture.</comment>
