<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("uncertainly certain") drives the arc, embodied in physical choices like soldering the compass. Final renunciation of certainty (planting random flowers) earns cost through prior causality, though epiphany borders on tell in workshop scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass spinning as mirror crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("let the gears turn freely"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; the waterfall’s thrum reweights failure as motion without soft resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (compass) constrains choice—Elias must improvise repair—and charges the final image. Greenhouse collapse isn’t backdrop; barnacle-encrusted discovery forces his pivot from certainty to acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when compass spins instead of pointing north, narrowing options to embracing uncertainty. Agency drives escalation (improvised tools, falling into shaft), with visceral cost (jolted ribs) and conceptual price paid in the garden decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass’s evolution from relic to mirror; "beneath the ashes" shifts from literal to doubt without moralizing. Final line ("It was a mirror") reweights prior struggle as self-reflection, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: tinkerer’s sensory focus ("copper wire," "barnacles") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shines in waterfall plunge ("hit the water hard, the shock jolting his ribs") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "leaves sharp as knives" charges action without muddle. Slight register drift in "improvise, he told himself" tells where showing could deepen pressure, but propulsion remains relentless to final seed-sowing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "broken-clock tinkerer" isn’t trope but engine for theme (gears as metaphor). Risk-taking heightens stakes—quiet ending reconfigures truth as subjective—without gimmickry, feeling inevitable post-discovery.</comment>
