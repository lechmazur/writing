<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied emotion ("heart stuttering," "fingers trembling") and contradictory impulses (cynicism vs hope) shine; final choice to document is earned through dust-pattern micro-choices. Lacks one visible flaw-driven mistake testing his "broken-hearted" state under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "began to write" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visceral cost ("heart full" after "ache of being unwanted"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via dust-button pattern accumulation; April 12 date delivers undeniable conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust patterns function as active micro-setting, constraining Elias' investigation ("disturbed in a perfect circle" enabling the cup inference). File room’s mildew/grime charges the final image but doesn’t pressure tactics beyond evidence-gathering, narrowly missing 9.0’s requirement for environmental constraint on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (reclaiming erased lives) tighten through Elias’ agency: dust analysis forces a trade-off (abstract hope vs tangible action). Cost is legible in his trembling hands and "heart full" realization, but the timeframe lacks a live clock escalating pressure beyond the button’s discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "magnify small kindnesses" is dramatized via the button’s journey and final documentation, avoiding moralizing. Ending folder-label reweights "unknown histories" as active resistance with conceptual cost—perfectly fulfills non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("read the language of neglect") and rhythmic control under pressure ("creeks of old wood") are exemplary. Compression in reflection ("after emancipation freed him... but not from the ache") feels earned; no head-hopping, voice modulates from clinical to lyrical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "brass surface tarnished but still bearing" does triple duty. Minor abstraction in "tactfully hopeful" slightly dulls immediacy. Zero loops; final line "began to write" avoids overwriting while recharging the button motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms foster care trope through material history (dust patterns as evidence). Button’s dual meaning (soldier’s loss/orphan’s anchor) avoids sentimentality. Risk in making bureaucracy poetic pays off with charged final image—fresh synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
