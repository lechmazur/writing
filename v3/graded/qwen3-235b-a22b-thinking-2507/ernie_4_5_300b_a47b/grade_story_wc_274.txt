<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("bravely conflicted") shown through micro-choices like trembling insertion of the letter, but Kael's instant understanding lacks friction; "bravely conflicted heart" label triggers diagnostic-speak penalty (-0.4) in peak awakening beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (Council retaliation looming), but "revolution began" final line obscures felt cost; causality holds under Causal lens though awakening resolution lacks tactical consequence escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cryo-chamber functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Lirael's insertion action) and charges closure (letter handoff); snow/library atmosphere enhances but doesn't actively pressure decisions beyond sensory texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lirael's agency (letter insertion forecloses safety), with visible cost in "Council will come" consequence; pressure escalates cleanly under Causal lens though Council threat remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cryo-chamber mechanics ("frozen truths" thawing) and final image ("revolution began"), avoiding moralizing; "truth matters" line earns resonance through prior struggle rather than thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ice crystals bloomed beneath her touch") persists under stress; minor register drift in "bravely conflicted" label slightly disrupts voice coherence during high-pressure awakening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No prose loops or scaffold, but "bravely conflicted" diagnostic label in two peak beats (-0.4) and "frantic drumbeat" cliché dilute line-level precision; final image propulsion remains uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryogenic archivist trope with truth-teller role; risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though snowy library setting leans familiar.</comment>
