<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hiding while observing") shown through empathy with widow/historian, but grief motivation lacks layered irrationality; "hiding from the world" veers toward label-speak without embodied struggle during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "hiding wasn’t about retreat" crystallizes stance with tangible cost (cradled letters), under Accumulative lens; disorientation resolved by "Nestled paradoxes" whisper pays off in closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Library setting constrains choice via Third Shelf mechanics and mirror reflections, but "enlarged tranquility" final image lacks environmental specificity; recurring invitation charges closure yet micro-setting (hollow shelf) doesn’t alter tactics beyond key insertion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief resolution) tightens through Eleanor’s observation-to-participation shift, but "hiding" action remains passive; cost is legible via letters yet agency feels circumstantial rather than driven by her choices under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through blank book/mirror motifs; "to find peace, you must first admit you’re lost" avoids moralizing by charging final image with Eleanor’s physical embrace of letters, reweighting "hiding" as revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frayed invitation," "dust-veiled ceilings") sustains under pressure; minor register drift in "enlarged tranquility" slightly dilutes Eleanor’s voice during climax without breaking consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "warped reflection" metaphor avoids muddle, but "back against the shelf, the letters cradled to her chest" slightly overwrites physicality, dulling closure’s tactile immediacy by 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Secret society trope transformed via grief lens and specific mechanics (Third Shelf, blank book); "wisdom lies in mistakes" reframes familiar theme through Eleanor’s tactile engagement with letters, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
