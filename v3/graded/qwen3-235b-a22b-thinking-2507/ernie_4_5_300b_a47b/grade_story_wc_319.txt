<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses (fearing light yet inviting darkness) manifest in embodied choices like breath syncing with mist; cultist’s void-eyes lack depth but her pocket-burning pendant and tactile garden navigation reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stepping onto the moss path crystallizes "boundaries as doors" with visible cost (cultist’s scream), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains choices—ice-crusted soil affects Mara’s movement, fountain ice enables pendant disposal, and glowing moss path directly charges the final image, exceeding micro-setting expectations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Mara’s agency: her wait (active interiorization) tightens options, and tossing the pendant incurs immediate cost (cultist’s collapse), reweighting "light boundaries" as doors under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "uncertainty is home" resonates through Mara’s final step and mentor’s lantern, avoiding moralizing; conceptual repricing of boundaries as doors reweights the entire premise without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost crystals hummed," "mist seeped into lungs") modulates with pressure; feral lyricism remains consistent even during climax, with no POV slippage or dialogue contamination.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion except minor paraphrase loop ("mist thickened... mist seeped") costing 0.3; high density maintained through concrete verbs ("claws digging," "sank with a hiss") without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms guardian tropes via "feral" specificity and emotional truth—Mara’s dimensional homesickness feels lived-in, while the boundary-as-door reframing synthesizes familiar concepts into a fresh, inevitable resolution.</comment>
