<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (blithe vs. weight of discovery) shown through micro-choices like gentle thread-touching; motivation clear but climax lacks deeper internal conflict beyond curiosity vs. duty. Final renunciation earned but cost could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("blithe nature tempered by weight," "carry knowledge"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as symbol density tightens stakes. Cost proof evident in "shape of intentions lingered."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt silo constrains choices (oculus constellation guides decoding) and charges final image ("walls pulse with discoveries"); sovereign case as micro-setting alters tactics via reburial. Meets 9+ gate by shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by decoding agency narrows options to "rebury or keep," with conceptual cost (knowledge as burden) legible in "tempered" demeanor. Single deepening suffices but cost could resonate more physically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "threads of fabric and light" reweighting "silence between moves" without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to "how dead communicate." No thematic echo, pure subtext in tapestry’s unraveling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized rows") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "conceptual cost" slightly jars gardener’s lexicon but paid off by closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; high density ("frayed threads whisper uncharted echoes") but "velveteen gloom" risks overwriting in opening. Final line avoids cliché through context, yet minor figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery gardener + time-map tapestry transforms tropes via chess/cosmic motifs; emotional specificity in "marigolds marking Alistair" avoids abstraction. Bold but premise not radically unprecedented.</comment>
