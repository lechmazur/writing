<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (wildflowers as talisman vs. coffee divination), but the whale's role feels underexploited for emotional stakes escalation; wife's loss lacks specific embodied cost beyond flower ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost: "no longer feared... new purpose" crystallizes stance shift via salt chamber discovery; causal drive (coffee pattern → tunnel → rose) holds flawlessly under Causal lens with gravity fluctuations as persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Salt crystals function as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (symmetry guiding panel discovery) and charges the final image ("gleaming silence"); environment's luminous fragility mirrors memory preservation with zero ornamental description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming memories) tightens through gravity's physical pressure during tunnel descent; cost is legible in "new purpose" reframing, though whale timeframe's urgency remains underdeveloped despite early mourning setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salt-preserving-memories metaphor without moralizing; final image ("flames burned steady") offers resonant CR by reweighting gravity pockets as preservers, not thieves, with conceptual cost of altered worldview.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows pull at edges of mind," coffee vortex) modulates with pressure; rhythmic control peaks in tunnel descent ("air thickened, his body growing heavier") with zero head-hopping or lexicon drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle white fragments" and "swirling vortex" exemplify textural specificity; sentence rhythms accelerate during gravity flares without muddying closure. Final line’s cadence shift ("steady, unwavering") perfects propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms memory-loss trope via salt crystal physics; "pockets of gravity" feel fresh through tactile constraints (crunching salt, shifting ground). Risk-taking (conceptual memory storage) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
