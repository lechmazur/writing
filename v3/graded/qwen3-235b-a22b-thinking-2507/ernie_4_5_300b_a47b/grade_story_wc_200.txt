<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("fear that laughter is not enough") drives the key choice to wield the tooth, but "modestly fearless" leans abstract despite concrete actions. Final endurance of hope earns cost through prior fear admission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Lira's transformed fear crystallizes into "luminous ache of hope" under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors by 50 words; dissonance-to-harmony cadence shift reweights stakes perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge’s humming pebbles and misaligned harp constrain Lira’s movement and perception, charging the final image where birds replace harp notes. Stone ribs pressing close mirrors emotional compression before release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: her fear admission ("laughter is not enough") forces the harp figure’s challenge, narrowing options to wield the tooth. Cost is embodied in throat-aching laughter and the tooth’s pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting: the crocodile’s tooth shifts from veil-piercing tool to "resilience" symbol, with final birdsong replacing harp notes offering non-literal answer to healing’s fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("air tasted of old dust") and rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses for tension, flowing sentences for revelation—teach the accumulative pattern early and pay off in the dawn-walk cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("modestly fearless" variants) and borderline overwritten phrase ("sky bled gold") deduct 0.2, but zero scaffold in closure beat preserves propulsion toward the tooth’s pulse.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms soul-collector trope through specific mechanics: gathering "spectral confessions" to weave healing threads, with laughter’s fragility grounding emotional truth. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
