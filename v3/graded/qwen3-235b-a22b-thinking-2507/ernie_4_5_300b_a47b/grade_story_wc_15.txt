<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "carve a path from ruin to reverence" is embodied through sewing actions and raw fingers, but lacks contradictory impulses; "hauntingly optimistic" heart is shown via smile, yet internal conflict remains underdeveloped despite credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: plates merging mends the labyrinth with visible cost (empty plates, refilling tide pools); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as thread density reweights the dominant stake through Lira's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and tide pools function as micro-setting that constrains choices (time pressure from emptying pools) and charges the final image (refilling pools reflecting dawn); thread-as-tool directly alters tactics during sewing sequences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's sewing agency under Accumulative lens: thread density intensifies until the plates merge, narrowing options to a single decisive act; cost is visible in raw fingers and empty plates, though not "unmistakable" per quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "broken precedents mended with thread" resolves in the final image of refilling tide pools, offering non-literal answer to remaking loss without moralizing; avoids all thematic echo pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("glassy surfaces sunken like exhausted eyes") and rhythmic control peak during the sewing climax; no head-hopping, with lyric compression taught early and paid off in the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "damp stone and older, sweeter things—memories, perhaps" exemplifies high-density propulsion; minor figurative muddle in "mouth full of silence" but no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "mending broken things" trope through weaver-specific lens; sleepwalking paths method feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
