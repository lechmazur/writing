<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in coffee-stain discovery ("breath hitched... nib trembled") where loyalty and truth collide physically. Minor deduction for slightly convenient epiphany pacing undermining the "diagnostic self-awareness" guardrail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "unplugged the landline" amid family collapse crystallizes the renunciation. Causal lens holds perfectly—"pay off the inspector" memo directly triggers exposure, satisfying cost proof test with "truth left scars."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: coffee-stained memo (physical artifact) enables discovery, while dome opening charges the finale’s "sunlight" metaphor. Rosewood desk/nib aren’t ornamental—they dictate how Clara processes truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally when the memo transforms abstract suspicion into concrete evidence, forcing Clara’s agency ("write your story"). Cost is visceral in "mother wept, 'How could you?'" but journalist’s arrival slightly softens the escalation’s causal purity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" evolves from metaphor to active principle in the finale ("learned to dance in their gravity"), reweighting the premise through the compass image without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo by making truth a "compass" not a destination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "traced constellations etched into rosewood desk" filters astronomy through tactile heritage. Stress compression ("Her breath hitched. The nib trembled") avoids uniformity, though "proof by contradiction" slightly strains Clara’s plausible lexicon mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gears grinding like celestial heartbeat" avoids cliché through action-driven rhythm. Final line’s "orbits of regret still spun" achieves textural specificity without muddle. Minor deduction for one near-duplicate ("spidery handwriting"/"faint coffee stain" proximity).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "corrupt heir" trope through astronomical framing—Clara’s "observant" trait isn’t generic but manifests in document analysis. Risk-taking in quiet Charged Poise closure pays off, though "black hole" metaphor edges close to overused physics analogies.</comment>
