<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("fuse insight with empathy") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; his "affectionate detachment" remains stated rather than embodied through conflicted choices under pressure. Lira functions as a transactional prop without meaningful friction against his stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis (Elias continues his work) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but the conceptual cost ("subsume joy") is declared rather than viscerally legible in the final image. The "faint but still present" scent lacks reconfiguration of prior stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber grotto constrains choice via its electromagnetic field enabling the blotter petal's function, and the final image of Elias placing the used petal in the case charges closure by crystallizing his detached artistry. Micro-setting (petal) directly shapes the transaction's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/lie balance) tightens when Lira tests *Eclipsed Memories*, but the cost ("subsume joy") remains abstract declaration rather than dramatized consequence. Pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing Elias's options or altering his tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the vial transaction: "half truths... interpretations" avoids moralizing, and the lingering scent metaphor offers resonant non-literal answer. Final line ("crafting half truths that would linger") subtly reweights the premise without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's perfumer-specific perceptual signature ("sensing through static electricity," orchid petal testing) creates distinct voice, with rhythmic control deepening under transaction pressure. No head-hopping; compression of Lira's transformation feels intentional within Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops but contains minor scaffold ("professionally thorough nature demanded...") in high-pressure beats. Final line achieves textural density ("grotto hummed with quiet satisfaction"), though "static-laden air" slightly overwrites Lira's reaction moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Counterfeit emotion dealer" synthesizes familiar melancholy tropes with fresh electro-perfumery mechanics, but the client transaction follows predictable template. Risk-taking in sensory method elevates premise without obscuring emotional stakes.</comment>
