<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("labyrinth of curiosity"), but motivation lacks contradictory impulses; "safeguard innovation" remains abstract without tested tradeoffs during the seed crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise with key) lands with conceptual cost ("world shifted"), but the felt price is oblique; storm-born silence motif pays off yet lacks tangible forfeiture like ruined workshop equipment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brook actively constrains choices (soil source, slime trail endpoint) and charges the final image; corpse flower’s stench becomes thematic texture without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (planting seed), but escalation lacks visible cost; panic over missing plant dissipates without altering tactics or resources.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through corpse flower’s paradox (beauty/death) and brook-as-door metaphor; avoids moralizing by reweighting "stop knocking" into the final escape room vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wax-sealed envelope," "ribbed like a brain") modulates under pressure; storm-born silence refrain teaches pattern early for lyrical payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "let the storm-born silence seep in" (redundant with later motif); otherwise high density with concrete verbs ("knelt, brushing aside reeds") avoiding figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escape room/botanical synthesis feels fresh, but "mystery seed" premise borders on familiar; brook-as-exit twist earns risk distinction by reconfiguring sanctuary logic.</comment>
