<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; her humming choice feels inevitable rather than contested by flaws. Embodied emotion ("voice raw but steady") strengthens micro-choices yet misses layered value hierarchy at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "woven dawns held" crystallizes options with visible cost ("scattered memories fragile, easily lost"). Accumulative lens holds throughout with density increase reweighting stakes via song-weaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse details are vivid but environment doesn't constrain choices; mica windows function as setting yet fail to actively alter Lira's tactics per 9+ gate requirement. Final image charged but lacks tool-driven constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency: pressing palm to mica window and humming deepens the song's power, narrowing options to fragile hope with unmistakable cost in her exhaustion and memory fragility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "woven dawns" as non-literal answer: realm learning to "swaddle itself in warmth of history" avoids moralizing. Final whisper "through forgotten songs we remember how to live" earns resonance via prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time pooled like mercury") and rhythmic control shine under pressure; lyrical compression during humming ("voice raw but steady") teaches pattern early and pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mica windows burned like tiny suns" crystallizes closure with high density. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle: fruit "igniting" as hope returns, no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms memory-keeper trope through alchemical orchard; risk-taking in quiet closure ("realm learning to shine") heightens emotional truth without gimmickry. Specific details ground universals.</comment>
