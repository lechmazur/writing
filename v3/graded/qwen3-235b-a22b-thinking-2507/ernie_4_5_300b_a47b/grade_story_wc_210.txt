<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing through embodied details ("gaunt face, eyes sunken," "tears mixing with salt spray"), but "hollow, a vessel emptied of purpose" edges toward abstract metaphor. Contradictory impulses (rejection of false comfort vs. desperate hope) drive choices credibly under memory-based pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (Elias' tears amid transformation), but bottle's mechanics remain opaque—why seamless glass enables revival isn't causally grounded. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: memory fragments accumulate density until the lanterns' shift reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amber bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (glowing lens), while salt-laden air and lanterns constrain perception. Sensory details ("clatter of carts," "scent of brine") reflect alchemist's professional bias, though phosphorus ore backstory feels expositional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency as memory work intensifies (ledger/compass scavenging → lanterns brightening), but pressure lacks visceral escalation—ghosts materializing feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choices. Cost is felt (emotional exhaustion) but not visibly reconfigured until the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "rebuilt not from stone and mortar, but from memory and will" reweights revival without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action (arranging artifacts), though "alchemy of recall" slightly verges on conceptual abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorus-rich ore," "elixirs that never quite worked") filters setting through alchemist's expertise. Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented despair ("no cork, no screw, no crack") to flowing revival ("hues of amber and violet"), with no POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("no cork, no screw, no crack. Just a smooth surface") triggers −0.2. Otherwise, high-density prose ("ghosts, no longer content to haunt, began to materialize") avoids overwriting. Final image’s specificity ("tears mixing with salt spray") rescues momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-town trope via memory-as-method constraint. Fresh inflection in "reimagining a civilization" through working memory feels inevitable, but "seamless glass" lacks unique properties—nearly swappable for any mystical object. Risks lyric structure without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
