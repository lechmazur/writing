<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Veyra’s embodied regret ("coiled in chest, hot and familiar") and contradictory impulses (clinging to fragments vs. surrendering) feel authentic. Final choice to wade in lacks sufficient escalation from prior micro-choices under ghost pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the rose reweights the lagoon’s meaning with undeniable cost (Veyra’s departure). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned sensory escalation toward crystallized final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lagoon’s micro-setting constrains choice (camera sinking) and charges the rose payoff, but kinetic properties (churning hues, sloshing rhythms) aren’t leveraged during climax to actively narrow options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (negotiating with ghost) tightens credibly through camera confrontation. Cost ("I’m tired," wading away) is felt but not unmistakable—lacks visible tradeoff like discarding a vital tool during departure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rose as non-literal answer to time/forgiveness without moralizing. "Lagoon knew the truth" risks thematic echo but avoids stating a moral, preserving earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised violet," wind "hissed secrets") and rhythmic control shine. Ghost dialogue slightly flattens under pressure ("You’ve brought trinkets"), diluting voice distinction at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; propulsion through concrete verbs ("sifting," "pulsed"). Minor density dip: "Regret coiled... hot and familiar" edges toward cliché despite specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms scavenger trope via time-distortion lens; camera wheel as fresh relic. Risk-taking (lyric time collapse) heightens stakes coherently, but ghost as younger self feels derivative.</comment>
