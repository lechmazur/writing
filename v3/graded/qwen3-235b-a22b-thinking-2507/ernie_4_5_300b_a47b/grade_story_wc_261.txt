<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied grief (scar as "map etched in flesh") and contradictory impulses—seeking closure while fearing reopened wounds—drive every choice. Her hyperaware post-surgery state grounds "accidentally telepathic" perception without diagnostic label-speak, making the coffee-ring visions feel earned. Final choice to "read stories aloud" crystallizes through tactile micro-choices (tracing rings, touching hourglass) with visible cost in the scar’s transformation from pain to connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara’s epiphany ("scars were bridges") reconfigures the displaced miracle concept with undeniable cost (scar’s burning throbs through visions to final lightness). Accumulative lens holds—the coffee-ring density escalation narrows options to acceptance, with the tower’s "meteor hush" crystallizing stakes. Orientation is immediate ("tower at dawn," anesthesia context), and cost proof is visceral in "no longer feeling pain but connection."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scar functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (her trembling hands, tracing rings) and charging the final image where pain becomes "connection." Tower details evolve causally: ivy whispers shift from Morse code to softened guidance, while coffee-ring mosaics actively pressure her descent. "Frost crackled, releasing a hum that vibrated in her teeth" exemplifies purpose-driven sensory specificity that mirrors internal urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding grief through scars) tightens via accumulative pressure: each coffee-ring vision deepens the wound while narrowing Mara’s path to acceptance. Her agency drives escalation—choosing which ring to examine alters knowledge and tactics, with the scar’s throbbing providing consistent cost. The final shattering hourglass reweights options without coincidence, fulfilling the band guardrail with "visible price that charges the final image."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "scars are bridges" avoids moralizing by rooting wisdom in Mara’s physical journey (teacup-sized ring vision, hospital scene). Mother’s "stories written in scars" line gains resonance through the scar’s embodied cost, not abstraction. Final image ("displaced miracle found its place") reweights the premise with conceptual cost—grief as active storytelling, not passive suffering—without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines: Mara’s post-anesthesia hyperawareness filters details ("roots tapping Morse code," sand "vibrating in her teeth"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, fractured sentences during visions ("Mara gasped, the scar burning") contrast with flowing cadence in epiphany. Purposeful compression (condensed altar scene) teaches the pattern early, paying off in the resonant final image without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "The tunnel opened beneath her, not of earth but of memory" achieve high density with concrete propulsion. Figurative language ("secrets pooled like stagnant water") serves character urgency without muddle. Final line "The displaced miracle had finally found its place" recharges the opening’s "displaced miracle" with earned simplicity, avoiding overwriting while crystallizing closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific, grounded choices: coffee-ring portals as memory triggers feel fresh yet inevitable, avoiding symbolic convenience. Emotional truth anchors the "displaced miracle" concept in bodily trauma (scar, anesthesia), not abstraction. The "meteor hush" tone shift exemplifies bold risk-taking—quiet closure that heightens stakes through accumulated sensory weight without gimmickry.</comment>
