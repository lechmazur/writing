<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (scientific duty vs. transformation pull) but climax lacks embodied struggle; human memories fight back without physicalizing the cost of resisting change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (relevance trivialized), but the herbalist’s vanishing creates causality ambiguity; lens (Accumulative) holds yet cost isn’t viscerally anchored in Elara’s final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underground garden’s humidity and soil actively constrain choices (kneeling in soil, bark-sprouting); arrowhead’s transformation directly charges the final image with the spiral symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via static confessions forcing metamorphosis, but escalation feels compressed; the cost of shedding human identity is conceptualized yet lacks tangible forfeiture beyond vague "fear of irrelevance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" emerges through concrete actions (static confessions, metamorphose), avoiding moralizing; final image of the spiral reweights the premise as ongoing cosmic play without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (botanical/scientific lexicon) modulates under stress; filter verbs ("she felt the pull") slightly dull immediacy during transformation but rhythm accelerates effectively in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops ("warped—her features elongating, her skin sprouting bark") and one template cadence ("She’d come... Now, it felt"); zero figurative muddle yet slight overwriting in sensory pileup ("crushed lavender and something sharper—petrichor, maybe").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid lore with gravitational physics; "static confessions" as transformation catalyst avoids trope reliance, though "frostbitten hope" risks cliché without deeper emotional texture in the resolution.</comment>
