<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("haunted euphoria") and embodied emotion ("stained with ink and salt") feel earned; micro-choices like pressing the locket flat reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance lacks visceral cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies through floral/ink motifs toward Charged Poise closure ("covenant’s weight... in the act of preservation itself"). Cost ("dread that beauty fades") legible but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty functions as micro-setting: moonflower roots constrain Elara’s kneeling position, while walnut ink’s absorption directly charges the final image ("stained with ink and salt"). Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist’s tactile priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (covenant unraveling) tighten through proximate causes motif; pressure coheres as Elara’s ritual deepens. Cost (emotional vigilance) is felt but not physically constrained—needed one more beat where jetty’s state directly impedes action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locket’s tarnish spreading "like a shadow" and closing flowers—not stated. Final line reweights "small moments" into non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: archivist notices "edges," "tarnish," "pulsing petals." Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("bruise of violets") to clipped ("She stood, brushing sand") under pressure. Zero register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "tarnish spreading like a shadow" avoids mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold in "paradox of patience and precision" slightly dulls momentum. Final image’s propulsion compensates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms covenant trope through proximate causes ritual. Emotional specificity ("thrill that it might not") avoids generic nostalgia. Risk-taking (textural escalation over causal turns) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
