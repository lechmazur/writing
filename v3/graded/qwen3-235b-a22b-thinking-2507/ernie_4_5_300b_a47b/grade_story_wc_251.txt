<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Clara’s grief rebellion ("quiet rebellion against the idea that grief must paralyze") and Lila’s shift from silence to "I’m learning," with embodied cost in Lila’s tightening grip on the pawn. Flaws: Clara’s "hearing unspoken words" lacks visible tradeoffs beyond plot convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Lila’s "I’m alone" shifts to "I’m learning" with the seed/forest motif crystallizing cost, under Accumulative lens. Two distinct non-closure issues (excessive backstory, weak causality in father revelation) trigger -1.5 cap, preventing 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto’s iron filings constrain choice (humming zipper, trembling pieces) and charge the final image ("unspoken words... shimmered"). Micro-setting elevates beyond description by physically shaping dialogue and the closure’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Lila’s unspoken words shifting from "I’m alone" to "I’m learning," narrowing options through Clara’s micro-choices. Agency falters as Clara’s father revelation feels coincidental, not earned by her tactics, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Planting forests of second thoughts" evolves from literal chess displays to Lila’s internal shift, with the final seed/image reweighting the premise without moralizing. Thematic resonance emerges solely through Clara/Lila’s tactile choices in the grotto.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Clara’s magnetic sensitivity ("pieces rattling softly," "magnetic field tugged") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift in "humble rebellion" risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats, but paraphrase-loop in "hush where past meets prophecy" (opening/reprise) triggers -0.2. High density ("moss-dusted stone," "fleeting hopes") fuels propulsion, though "prophecy" repetition slightly dulls closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes via magnetic grotto’s physics and "second thoughts" as active rebellion. Fresh inflection in using window displays as communal dialogue, but avoids gimmickry by rooting risk in Clara’s grief-driven choices.</comment>
