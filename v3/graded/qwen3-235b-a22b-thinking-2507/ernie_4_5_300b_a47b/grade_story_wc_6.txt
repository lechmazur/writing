<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira’s embodied contradictions (firefighter vs arsonist’s daughter) shine, but Mara’s motivation lacks depth; "only friend" feels unearned. Micro-choice with the coin reveals values, yet secondary characters apply minimal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the falling sand grain crystallizes "carrying weight" with visible cost. Orientation anchors by line 5, but backstory reflection risks BRR violation at 22% of word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon actively constrains choices (volcanic soil fertility informs Lira’s hope), and black sand charges the final image. However, "kelp-drift peace" tone isn’t modulated during tension with Mara.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening through the bird rescue (agency = splinting despite pain) narrows options effectively. But the man’s dialogue about her father feels externally imposed rather than organically escalating pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from action: "scars don’t forget, they learn to sing" gains weight through the coin and sand. Final image reweights "carrying weight" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sand hissed like a secret") and rhythmic control excel, but "gracefully alert" overuse as filter verb dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "jingled like a warning" is minor mixed metaphor. Final "unyielding spark" slightly overwrites but doesn’t dull closure. Zero loops or scaffold in critical beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of volcanic fertility/scars avoids tropes through specific detail. Emotional truth elevates "arsonist’s daughter" premise, but safety-hedging in Mara’s resolution limits risk.</comment>
