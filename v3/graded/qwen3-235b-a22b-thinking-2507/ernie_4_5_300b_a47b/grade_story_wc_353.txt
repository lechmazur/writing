<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion ("tears carving paths through dust") but lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; hedgehog presence unused for relationship pressure. Motivation clear but interiority avoids flaw-driven mistakes that compound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (grove humming with silent music) with felt cost (shattered insulator, bleeding nails), but orientation fails: "one morning" arrives too late (~180 words), missing 120-word anchor window. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: stress cracks and porcelain insulator directly constrain choices and charge the final image ("blue glaze faded but purpose eternal"). Alders evolving into amphitheater shows environment shaping tactics. Siskin grove stays atmospheric rather than indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes ("create music in silent world") signaled early but never tested against active resistance; escalation relies on repetition ("strummed until nails bled") rather than protagonist-driven deepening. Cost visible (shattered insulator) but pressure lacks narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "empathy in motion" dramatized in stump's vibration, not stated. Final image ("faintest hum... music endures") resonates without moralizing. Avoids all thematic echo pitfalls while reweighting silence as musical substrate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded mind," "leaves trembling like eager listeners") but overwriting in climax: "symphony of creaks and groans and wind through nonexistent reeds" dilutes momentum. Consistent voice despite minor lyric drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Adjacent synonym loops ("fissures," "stress cracks," "fracture") and template cadence in strumming sequences ("She strummed... She strummed..."). Final paragraph's paraphrase loop ("never stopped sculpting... moved from tree to tree") dulls closure image. Near-miss for 8.0 band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "music from silence" trope through specific constraints (porcelain insulator, stress cracks), but premise echoes familiar archetypes. Emotional truth elevates it, yet hedgehog motif lacks fresh inflection. Bold structural risk (silent music) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
