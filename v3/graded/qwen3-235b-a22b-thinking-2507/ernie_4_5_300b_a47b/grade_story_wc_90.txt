<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (avoidance vs engagement) crystallize in the meditation chamber as Lira confronts "grief and love were not opposites but twins," earning her pivotal stitching choice. Slight abstraction in early pacifism motivation ("believed peace meant avoiding conflict") slightly weakens causality until the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the door splitting "with a sigh" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (shattered locket, dissolved shadows), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors ship/degradation by paragraph 2, and "long-dried tears" repetition is the sole minor artifact not touching closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The locket functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (must face shadow to activate) and charges closure (shatters to open the door). Bioluminescent garden’s "singing leaves" directly reweights prior decay, fulfilling 9+ gate through environmental constraint on the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira’s agency: her choice to enter the chamber tightens options, and the locket’s dimming creates tangible cost. Shadow work mechanics lack mid-beat development (e.g., AI’s explanation feels declarative), slightly muting pressure until the stitching climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of the garden as "invitation—to live, to love, to engage" reweights pacifism without moralizing, emerging from concrete action ("stitch with words, memories, truth"). Avoids thematic echo despite AI’s "wore it like a cloak" line, which is earned through prior struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Lira notices "ghostly resolve of centuries-old systems" and laughter as gravitational quirk. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("cold, smooth, unyielding—until she began to stitch"), though "quantum-engineered DNA" momentarily drifts from voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Verbatim repetition of "long-dried tears on faded photographs" creates a paraphrase loop (-0.3), and "gravitationally lighter" trait lacks early embodiment. Otherwise, high density ("shadows dissolved into light") and strong verbs propel momentum without muddying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "shadow work" through specific mechanics (Kwan Yin’s Tear as liquid light) and emotional truth ("to stitch the world was not to fix it"). Risk-taking in pacifist-as-key avoids gimmickry, but "after last human" premise edges close to common sci-fi templates without deeper innovation.</comment>
