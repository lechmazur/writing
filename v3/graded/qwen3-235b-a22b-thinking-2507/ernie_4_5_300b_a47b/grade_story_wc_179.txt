<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lirael’s "scheming" trait lacks active demonstration beyond ritual setup; secondary characters like Kael shift too quickly without sufficient friction. Strengths: cellular memory sacrifice shows embodied motivation, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens—Lirael’s "resentment will creep back" crystallizes cost with the pin’s vanishing. Minor deduction: pin’s reappearance mechanics slightly undermine causality cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s velvet walls actively constrain choices (silence necessitates object-based healing), charging the final image where "silence faded into the hum." Environment shapes tactics and closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through visitor sequence (Kael’s resentment raising pressure), but "reality shifts" timeframe lacks tangible urgency as a live clock. Cost is felt in Lirael’s depletion yet not viscerally tested under peak stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("grace had shifted. And that was enough") offers resonant, non-literal answer to resentment without moralizing. Pin’s scars-as-stars reweights brokenness theme organically, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice modulates effectively under pressure (shorter sentences for Kael’s climax), but "cellular memory extract" jars clinical register against poetic flow. Perceptual signature strong yet inconsistent in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "time bending like taffy" risks density slip with consecutive similes. Zero scaffold in closure beat, though "flicker of understanding" skirts abstraction (saved by tactile "whisper of release").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "healing object" trope via cellular memory mechanics and scarred pin, but sanctuary leans on soundproof-room cliché. Risk-taking elevates stakes yet safety-middle lingers in visitor resolutions.</comment>
