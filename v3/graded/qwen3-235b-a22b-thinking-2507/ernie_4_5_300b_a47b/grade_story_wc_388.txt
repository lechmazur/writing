<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s "truth excavator" motivation intensifies credibly to survival, but internal contradiction (debunker vs. believer in patterns) lacks simultaneous tension during the climax. Flawed diamond’s "consequence not malice" realization charges her choice, yet emotional layering feels streamlined under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: sealing the stillpoint forecloses Mara’s investigative path with visible cost (diamond’s weight gone, radiation drop). Causal lens holds, but the fissure’s sudden appearance strains "because/therefore" linkage during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard’s soil and dust storms constrain every choice—Mara’s gloved hands brushing "radioactive grit," trees leaning toward the center—and the final image of branches "unfurling like sighs" charges closure with undeniable environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate credibly from solving a disappearance to preventing global collapse, but the "wasteland swallowing the world" implication arrives late, diluting causal pressure until the chamber revelation. Mara’s agency in placing the diamond narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "comfortable lies had no place here" crystallizes via Mara’s choice to bury the diamond, not abstract moralizing. The final line reweights "secrets" as dangerous through the orchard’s survival, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s voice ("truth excavator," "conspiracy debunker" lexicon) filters all perception, but filter verbs like "Mara’s intuition prickled" slightly dull immediacy during the letter-reassembly beat. Prose rhythm modulates effectively under dust-storm pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "defied logic—thriving in soil... sterilized by fallout" restated as "locals whispered the land was haunted." Otherwise, clean propulsion; "branches unfurling like sighs" avoids cliché while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed object" trope via scientific framing (diamond as "keyed" tool), with emotional specificity in Mara’s rejection of "comfortable lies." Risk-taking in the stillpoint’s conceptual stakes feels organic, though wasteland setting leans familiar.</comment>
