<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak but "quietly inspired" trait remains observational; micro-choices during button-sorting reveal value hierarchy yet lack contradictory impulses in peak pressure. Final endurance lacks felt cost specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "future as field to be planted" reconfigures prophecy with conceptual cost, but "unscramble truths" motivation isn't tested by tangible stakes. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shift in button-sorting beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: sawdust muffled steps and groaning beams directly constrain Mara's movement while echoing thematic weight of history. Final window scene charges closure through tactile cliff imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking echo) tightens through button-sorting method, but "raw possibility" cost remains abstract. Agency drives escalation yet lacks visible price beyond conceptual shift; "unscramble chaos" deepening feels under-tested by physical consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing through "tapestry woven from threads of past" revelation, but canyon's choral message risks thematic echo. Final button-cataloging image reweights "quiet inspiration" without stating moral, though cost lacks visceral anchoring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "sawdust carpet" and "moth-eaten maps" details; rhythmic control accelerates during echo's dissonant chorus. No head-hopping, though "librarian of half-remembered tales" momentarily drifts into authorial abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats but "liquid canyon" metaphor slightly violates physical logic. Final line's "hands steady, heart light" risks emotional flatlining after revelation; minor cadence dip in reflection paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through tactile button-sorting method and "field to be planted" reconfiguration. Avoids generic wisdom via amber-light physics, though warehouse setting leans slightly on dusty-archive clichés despite strong specificity.</comment>
