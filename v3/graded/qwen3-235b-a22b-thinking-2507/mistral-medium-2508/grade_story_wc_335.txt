<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elspeth’s contradictory impulses (teaching return vs. hiding cost) drive closure; Kael’s embodied doubt ("hands trembled") earns growth. Slight thinness in Kael’s interiority limits 9.0 despite strong micro-choices like tracing tea-dreg shapes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: shadow bound but cost ("learn the cost of coming back") legible in final wait. Escalation via shadow’s lunge and Kael’s annotations reweights exile under accumulative lens with felt cost in the library’s groan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library actively swallows shadows; teacup dregs constrain choices (Kael’s trembling hands, leaf-reading method). Playground swing’s hush tightens temporal pressure, charging the final stillness as closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear of misreading exile) escalates through shadow’s lunge and Kael’s binding act. Cost of return remains slightly abstract, but "teach you how to return" and annotations’ glow reweight stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile emerges through tea-leaf geometry and shadow-binding, not statement. Final image ("wait for next shadow to knock") reweights exile as cyclical duty without moralizing, passing Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("kind of quiet that makes people lean in") and rhythmic control during shadow confrontation ("lunged upward... yanked back") show mastery. No POV drift; compression taught early via fragmented backstory cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "dregs slosh into a new constellation" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor register drift in "combative tenderness" description (slightly abstract) prevents 9.5, but closure imagery ("annotations glowed faintly") remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "mentor" trope via shard-mirror archivist and reversible exile. Tea-leaf geometry method feels fresh through concrete stakes (shadow binding). Avoids safety middle with morally ambiguous "love that didn’t flinch from teeth".</comment>
