<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias measuring silence yet seeking proof; embodied emotion via "knees hit damp earth" avoids labels. Final renunciation earned by prism's warmth preceding shatter, but motivation slightly fuzzy pre-vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "shoulders unknotting" and "hands finally still" crystallize the weight release. Accumulative lens holds through frost pattern escalation to the prism's answering hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor actively constrains choices—the shatter must occur there for light to splinter echoes. Frost patterns function as micro-setting, charging the final image with "sorrowless streams" melting the car's memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency: his commingling shifts from observation to terror when the prism "answers," narrowing options to destruction. Cost is unmistakable in the physical unknotted shoulders after hurling the prism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the prism's destruction: "some proofs were better left unproven" avoids moralizing by reweighting the premise via the chiming branches' ambiguous laughter. Complexity lies in inherited trauma versus necessary silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "measured silence in degrees" and frost-as-language. Rhythmic control peaks during the vision ("whispering *I should have known*") with purposeful compression paid off by the shatter's soundless vibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "fractured rainbows that bled into mist" doing triple duty. Figurative language ("sorrow that settles into bones") remains precise in high-pressure beats without muddling cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "shifted hush" mechanics transforms haunted-object tropes. Emotional specificity in the prism holding his mother's trauma—not ghosts—elevates through concrete stakes, though premise risks familiarity without this detail.</comment>
