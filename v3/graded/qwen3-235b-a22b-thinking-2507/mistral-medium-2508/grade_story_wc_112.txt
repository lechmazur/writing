<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not just a sky mechanic" duality; embodied emotion via "mechanically warm" hands and oil-wiping micro-choice earns final belief shift. No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant; blind spots in protocol violations compound organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "K-11 was gone. Not dead. Elsewhen." Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (holograms→solidity→shore/nest imagery). Cost proof: "elsewhen" reconfigures time's nature without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the lever constrains choices (cold pull/tuning) and charges final image ("rest his hand there"). Gas giant's shifting bands mirror time distortion, avoiding overt symbolism. Environment directly shapes tactics via "clocks running slower" observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: lever adjustment narrows options from "violate protocols" to "step through time." Conceptual cost (K-11's transition) alters tactics instantly. Accumulative escalation peaks with lab→shore reconfiguration under coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: "time didn't just move forward. It spilled. Sideways." Final wingbeat in "sideways dark" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "spilled" motif gains visceral weight via K-11's disappearance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "cobalt light, twisting like a school of fish" filters physics through Elias' mechanic's eye. Rhythmic control peaks in "rewinding, then fast-forwarding" compression during stress. Zero register drift despite technical concepts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "metal fatigues singing in the hush of beating wings at rest" achieves triple duty (sensory/atmosphere/cost). Final line "so did the sky" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Propulsion via strong verbs ("shuddered," "snapped," "spilled").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel trope through xenobiology lens: "subdued awakenings" as sediment-layer memory feels inevitable. Emotional specificity in Elias' quiet triumph avoids generic templates. Gas giant setting isn't backdrop but causal element for time distortion.</comment>
