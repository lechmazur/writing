<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "unlearning" assumption shift, but emotional embodiment lacks visceral specificity at climax (e.g., "breath hitched" feels generic). Micro-choices like discarding props reveal values, yet flaw-driven struggle remains abstract without concrete stakes beyond philosophical cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: gravity reversal crystallizes "beginning disguised as end" with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight reversed"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density peaks as towers sing, reweighting lunar perigee’s meaning through harmonic resonance without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned radio tower functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (climbing rusted stairs) and charges closure (gorge amplifying song). "Skeletal transmitters" etch environmental stakes, yet sensory hierarchy occasionally defaults to visual over tactile urgency during high-pressure tuning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find beginning in every ending") tightens via Elara’s agency: discarding assumptions narrows options to surrender, paid in shattered dish and internalized hum. Cost legibility falters slightly—the emotional toll of mentor’s legacy remains implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "shard of hush" reconfiguration: final image of jumping to rise offers resonant answer to "beginning/end" question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in action (gravity reversal), not abstraction—proving assumptions themselves were the cage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("serenely electric hum," "shard of hush") shapes rhythm under pressure. Elision of mentor’s backstory taught early via "peeling back layers of noise," paying off in earned unlearning. Minor register drift in "cosmic symphony" risks overwriting but serves Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, yet high-pressure tuning sequence risks density overload: "chorus of static resolving into a single, trembling note" slightly muddles cause/effect. Propulsion never stalls, but "drunken sentinels" metaphor strains physics without payoff, costing 0.2 in high-band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes radio archaeology with cosmic intimacy—abandoned towers singing via moon’s pull transforms tropes through specific stakes. Risk-taking (gravity reversal as earned mindset shift) heightens coherence without gimmickry, making "fantasy practicality" feel inevitable.</comment>
