<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "beautician by trade, mortician by calling" manifests through embodied choices (tracing stone, pressing chip) under pressure. Final renunciation of fearing oblivion earned by tactile micro-choices like brushing the wrist, with cost in the spent chip's dullness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "thresholds were not walls, but breaths held between two notes" crystallizes stance with cost in the chip's expended light. Accumulative lens holds—aurora's static pattern deepens into bridge—without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto constrains every choice: Liora kneels on its ledge, the aurora's static is the language she reads, and its "hummed differently" charges the final image. Petrified mist walls directly enable the doorway's emergence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering the dead woman's message) tightens when Liora infuses the chip, narrowing options to a single choice: reach through. Cost is visceral—the chip's light spent, the grotto's altered hum proving irreversible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: the "threshold of stillness" shifts from feared end to "breaths held between two notes," with the final image ("spark... didn’t go out") offering non-literal resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-specific noticing: "wind stuttered against the stone" mirrors Liora’s mortician attunement to breath thresholds. Rhythmic control peaks in the aurora’s "slow and endless exhale" closing line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops, but "fractured heart pulsing with a light that wasn’t light" slightly muddles physics; compensated by propulsion in "Liora reached through, her fingers brushing the woman’s wrist" where syntax accelerates action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms death tropes via specific mortician lens ("lips parted mid-sentence") and skyborne grotto’s tangible rules. Risk-taking (static as language) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making "threshold" concept feel inevitable.</comment>
