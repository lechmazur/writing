<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("she needed motion; he, stillness") drives micro-choices like charcoal sketching, embodying emotional tension without therapy-speak. Final renunciation of binary thinking earns cost through prior causality, though "gently persuasive" trait lacks active demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "weight felt lighter" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("love was the quiet before the storm"). Accumulative lens holds throughout, though cost legibility slightly softens the final image’s pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vineyard setting constrains choice (letter discovery under leaves) and charges closure ("grapes hung heavy"). Sensory specificity ("crushed grapes," "charcoal from brazier’s ashes") evolves with emotional urgency, making environment inseparable from final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling mismatch) tightens via letter discovery and sketching, narrowing options to acceptance. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "quiet before the storm" reweights mismatch as balance. Avoids moralizing while offering resonant answer via final vineyard step, though "destined mismatches" phrasing risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in vineyard-rooted noticing ("soil’s slow sighs," "grapes’ tendril"). Rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("brittle snapped," "breath curling"), with no head-hopping or register drift in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "amber pavilion sagged under autumn’s gold" layers setting/emotion. Minor synonym churn in "smoke and old regrets" prevents 9.0, but zero loops or scaffold in closure beat maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "sentinel" trope through vineyard-specific observation. Emotional truth in mismatch avoids abstraction, though "scholar of celestial maps" risks slight archetypal safety. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
