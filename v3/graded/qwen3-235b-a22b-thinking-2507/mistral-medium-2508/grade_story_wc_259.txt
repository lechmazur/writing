<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rich but contradiction under pressure lacks teeth; pivotal "fear was just another pattern" rings slightly abstract without embodied struggle in the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "to purify is to let go" crystallized by the veil's fading and heart's "unpredictable" weight. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archive setting actively constrains choice—the pagoda's vibration demands non-logical engagement, and the bronze prism charges the final image as light-cascade.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through historian’s agency: avoiding patterns culminates in unmaking motion. Cost is visceral in the veil’s transformation and "hollow" future-self glimpse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: pagoda crumbling into light reweights "purify" as release, not control. Final saffron scent avoids moralizing while resonating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("atoms of nostalgia," "dust rained in golden sheets") modulates rhythm under pressure. No head-hopping; elision of mentor’s death taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "not by burning it, but by avoiding..." slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, high density and rhythm variation propel the climax without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archive tropes through sensory specificity: saffron veil’s dye as temporal marker, bronze prism as vibrational record. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
