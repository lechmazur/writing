<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (flee vs harness guilt) manifest in embodied choices like deliberate vial uncorking; micro-choices (silt-stirring boots, chain unsnarling) reveal hierarchy of values with visceral cost in the Elias vision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "skin unmarked... vial held only clear water" crystallizes the hush’s irreversible rewrite, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration where silence replaces screams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The perfume vial functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (oxygen-depleting uncorking) and charging the final image (wind-carried violets); jellyfish-light actively shapes perception during the hush’s gathering, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds in deepening the hush’s pressure ("pressing against her marrow"), but the oxygen countdown lacks causal traction—time pressure fades before climax, weakening the tangible cost of the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial’s transformation: "time... to hold, gently, like a vial of light" reweights the hush as acceptance, avoiding moralizing while resonating with Elias’s lingering voice—a non-literal answer to guilt’s weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in pressure-filtered details ("bioluminescent jellyfish drifted like slow, indifferent stars"), but "rebreathed" repetition risks mechanical cadence; voice modulates perfectly from fractured urgency to hushed resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "frayed silk" and "dissolving like salt" metaphors deepen texture without muddle. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing slightly jars the POV’s lexicon during high-stakes reflection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming "hush" from abstract concept to harvestable substance with violets-as-memory; risks (lyric compression, quiet closure) heighten emotional truth but the underwater guilt trope lacks full novelty despite precise execution.</comment>
