<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sentimental disguised as rigor") powers the climax; embodied cost in losing "the girl who pressed flowers" grounds the transformation without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stepping through the door crystallizes stance with visible cost ("last shred of the girl") under Accumulative/Textural lens; starlings' patterns teach the lens early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen dew crystal constrains every choice—from theft to melting—and charges the final image; its "singing" and blue-flame transformation directly reconfigure the orchard's reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist's agency: observing starlings' "equations" deepens the dominant stake (logic/intuition harmony), narrowing options until the crystal's melting forces irreversible transformation with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "wonder held, not solved" crystallizes in the door-step moment without moralizing; prior particulars (stolen crystal, sentimentality) reweight the final realization organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("fire danced when fed by unseen winds"); rhythmic control under pressure ("flame turned blue") avoids head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's sensory precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "ice within began to sing—a sound like glass bells ringing backward through time" merges image/sound with plot; slight overwriting in waterfall description barely touches momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: alchemy as emotional logic transforms tropes; the starlings' flight as "method" feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
