<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (chasing growth vs. embracing silence) crystallizes in Elias's final choice; embodied emotion in trembling hands and "pulse roared" avoids abstraction. Woman's arrival tests his isolation but secondary pressure isn't deepened enough for 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Elias leaves his life's work for uncertain collaboration. Accumulative lens holds as sonic patterns reweight stakes, with "dictionary's spine cracked" proving conceptual cost. One persistent constraint (silence) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal functions as micro-setting that charges closure—Elias's final look at its "humming" state embodies the theme. Fractured light motif evolves from atmosphere to active constraint during voice experiments. Library's neglect directly pressures his testimony attempt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding silence) tightens through Elias's escalating experiments, narrowing options to collaboration. Cost is visceral: abandoning his isolated quest. Woman's arrival complicates but doesn't resolve; pressure coheres under accumulative lens though secondary character's role lacks tactical depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete sonic patterns—"listening" as growth reweights language's death without moralizing. Final image ("child repeated a word") embodies earned wisdom. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in action: Elias's hand grasp answers the central question non-literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: academic precision ("sonically reflective") fraying into sensory urgency ("pulse roared"). Rhythmic control shifts from measured sentences to fragmented beats during crystal experiments. Zero head-hopping; elision of woman's origin taught via shared hope in eyes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured gold" to "whispering future in fragments" shows purposeful density. Weak modifier ("rough, weathered") in woman's description is sole artifact. Final line’s cadence shift ("pattern wasn’t in the growing. It was in the listening") delivers propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms "language death" trope through sonic crystal mechanics. Emotional specificity in Elias's "reticent no longer" arc avoids abstraction. Fresh inflection: silence as "breath held before the next word" synthesizes premise organically. Risks poetic closure without gimmickry.</comment>
