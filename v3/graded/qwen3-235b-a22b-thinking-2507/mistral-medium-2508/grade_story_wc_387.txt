<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael’s micro-choices (stirring counterclockwise, handing the whisk) embody his philosophy through action, not abstraction. Liora’s shift from skepticism ("Why fix what no one sees?") to joining the whistle earns her change via the minnows’ tangible response. Slight thematic edge in "pulse thrummed in wrists" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when Liora’s "rough but true" whistle crystallizes her shifted awareness, with cost in the minnows’ lingering dance and her new breath awareness. One deepening suffices; Accumulative lens holds flawlessly from moon-path setup to final cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The parapet’s "breathing" nets and tea whisk constrain choices (whistling affects minnows) and charge closure. Firefly season’s temporal pressure tightens the moment; "crushed mint" scent grounds Liora’s skepticism in embodied perception. Essential for 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Liora’s whistle reveals the minnows’ response to "hidden patterns," transforming her abstract doubt into visceral cost (awareness of her own breath’s weight). Escalation driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; moon-path method shapes the pivotal attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: mending nets, the whisk’s grooves, minnows dancing where the whistle was. Final image ("minnows still danced") reweights "hidden patterns" without moralizing; Kael’s "some things are hidden *because* they’re seen" avoids thematic echo by charging Liora’s choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "lantern glow caught the grooves—each one a record of unseen labor," filtering world through Kael’s philosophy. Dialogue carries subtext ("You’re late"/"bridge was slick"); rhythm modulates from "scintillatingly somber" to Liora’s "rough but true" note under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "splayed like the legs of a startled spider" recharges closure via the whisk’s final pickup. Final line ("cycle began again") crystallizes the motif with propulsion. Only microscopic flaw: "scintillatingly somber" slightly elevated but justified by Kael’s voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope through net-mending philosophy and tea ritual. Risk-taking in quiet escalation (whistle/minnows) heightens stakes; specificity of "calluses on Kael’s hands" avoids genericity. Fresh angle: hidden patterns as active resonance, not passive observation.</comment>
