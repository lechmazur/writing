<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "meek by nature" versus "slow-burning will," embodied through trembling hands feeding silk "inch by deliberate inch" with palpable cost in the spent magic. Micro-choice of pressing palm to stone crystallizes endurance without tidy epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: silk vanishes but planet hums with "azure defiance," villagers realigning arches while smith’s "quiet determination now a thing with edges." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as sensory density reweights resilience from stillness to active listening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard planet’s floating arches constrain choices literally—they shudder above him—while silk functions as micro-setting charging the final image (anvil’s hum). Sensory specificity ("scent of crushed fruit and old magic") mirrors internal state through action, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: feeding silk into the fissure narrows options (only one coil remains) with felt cost (magic spent). Pressure coheres as "barter" whispers escalate to the planet’s sigh, reweighting "resilience" from abstract to actionable through his deliberate choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "azure defiance" reweighted from silk’s "cracked ice" shimmer to the planet’s hum, avoiding moralizing. Final image (anvil’s hum) offers non-literal answer: resilience is listening, not mending—a resonant repricing without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("threads shimmering like cracked ice") reflects smith’s forge-honed eye; rhythmic control under pressure in "inch by deliberate inch" with lyrical compression taught early. Voice modulates from hushed ("hiss of his forge") to charged ("planet answered. Not with violence, but with a sigh").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rubble shifting, settling, as if the earth itself had chosen to stand" layers character/world with propulsion. Near-miss: "shimmering like cracked ice" slightly overwrought but redeemed by payoff in final hum. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "healing the world" trope through specific barter logic: silk as bargaining tool, not fix. Emotional truth in smith’s quiet endurance ("I just listened") avoids generic heroism. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
