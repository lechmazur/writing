<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("ribs ached to expand, to *detach*") and embodied emotion ("scrimshaw fit his palm like a key") earn transformation through prior causality; final renunciation of land carries felt cost in "the past did not."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("the door was wide open") reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("the past did not"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density escalation to the scrimshaw's vibration and island's dissolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe constrains choice (trench where roots unravel) and charges closure ("water clearing to reveal the truth"); scrimshaw functions as micro-setting, evolving from pocket object to key that dissolves the cage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (climbing the pier, unfolding) under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "the pain was bright, clean" and "the past did not" as land's chains dissolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Final image ("door wide open") offers resonant answer to freedom's meaning without moralizing; whale's "freedom is not absence of bonds" emerges organically from prior physical stakes, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt-stiffened ropes biting like old grudges") modulates under pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("island shrinking... like a secret too heavy") pays off in seamless transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pain was bright, clean, like first breath after a dive" achieves high density without figurative muddle; final line recharges "key" motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Specific synthesis (disappearing island as cage, not tragedy) feels inevitable; risk-taking (whale as lock) heightens stakes through concrete details like the scrimshaw's vibration against skin.</comment>
