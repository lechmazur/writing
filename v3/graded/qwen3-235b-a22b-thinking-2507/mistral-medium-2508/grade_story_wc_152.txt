<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (stitching errors as coded resistance), but courier remains pressure-tool rather than full character; micro-choices like burning the note reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("boots on stairs," shattering dome reconfiguring embroidery into "seeds"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density of cosmic imagery tightening toward broadcast.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory’s dome isn’t backdrop but constraint—its shattering *is* the closure image charging scattered embroidery; tools (loom, telescope) actively shape Elias’s final act with cosmic consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. censorship) tighten through Elias’s agency: synchronizing telescope/flame escalates pressure under Accumulative lens; cost crystallizes when enforcers arrive early, foreclosing escape with physical immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (stories as resistance) emerges solely through embroidery/flame motifs, never stated; final image of "seeds" scattered across the city reweights prior material into resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in cosmic textile metaphors ("threaded a silver needle through fabric of cosmos"); rhythmic control under pressure ("synchronized breath with clockwork") avoids lyric drift through embodied urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero scaffold—dense metaphors like "adjacent possibilities" are pattern-taught early and paid off in closure; minor deduction for "echoed silence" bordering abstraction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms resistance tropes through specific synthesis (embroidery as coded astronomy); "galaxy-chart embroiderer" feels inevitable in hindsight with bold risk (cosmic stakes via textile craft) heightening coherence.</comment>
