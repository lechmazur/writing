<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete (tracing tree wounds mirroring face, milk tooth's dull gleam), but Lila's off-page presence limits relationship crucible. Final choice to leave the box earned by visceral micro-choices like reading the child's note while breath fogs porcelain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "left the box on the stone" physically enacts relinquishment while sap/moonlight fills cracks. Accumulative lens holds through patterned image escalation (cracks→veins→sap) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fire-skipped stone constrains the drawing act and charges closure, while porcelain box functions as micro-setting that evolves from relic to offering. "Pine sap and moonlight" filling cracks demonstrates environment charging the final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake ("how to hand pain without cutting") tightens through Elias's agency: ex-wife's call → reinterpretation of cracks → drawing with charred stick. Cost crystallizes in relinquishing the box, foreclosing his isolation path with tangible weight shift ("steps were lighter").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through porcelain box's transformation (relic→offering), avoiding moralizing. Final phoenix drawing with child's face provides resonant non-literal answer to central question, reweighting "cracks" as life-giving veins without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (firefighter noticing "fire-skipped stone," "charred stick"), with rhythmic control under pressure. Slight register drift in "alchemize" metaphor compensated by profession-specific voice and taught patterned reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "silvering pine needles like scattered bones" shows textural specificity. Minor scaffold in reflection block ("blaze that had taken his crew...") avoids overwriting through visceral payoff in milk tooth detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms firefighter trope through porcelain box specificity and "cracks as veins" insight. Bold quiet closure risks sentimentality but lands via concrete action (leaving sap-filled box), synthesizing pain alchemy with earned emotional truth.</comment>
