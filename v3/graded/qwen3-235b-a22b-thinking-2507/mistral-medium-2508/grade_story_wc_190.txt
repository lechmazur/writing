<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’ silent ministrations vs. his voiced insight; passenger’s embodied grief ("shoulders unclenched") avoids labels. Micro-choices like copper spoon use reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "lighter now" terrace and "teaching stillness how to carry" reconfigures silence with conceptual cost (recalibrated sorrow). Accumulative lens holds—density of refracted sound tightens meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storm glass vial constrains choices (dial adjustments, spoon ritual) and charges final image ("clear as a held breath"). Prism terrace’s refractions actively bend sound, avoiding static description by altering tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating sensory pressure: vial’s darkening, refracted laughter, and recalibrated weight narrow options toward Elias’ philosophy. Cost is legible in passenger’s "better distributed" burden but lacks deeper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("let the gondola drift") reweights transit as vessel for sorrow without moralizing. Theme emerges through vial’s transformation—"gives it somewhere to go"—avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity of unspoken grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "vaulting hush hummed in the bones" and prism-refracted sound. Rhythmic control under pressure ("breath held too long becomes motion") avoids head-hopping despite dual presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-9.0 prose marred by "vaulting hush so deep it hummed in the bones"—slightly overwritten cadence. Zero loops, but "damp with unspoken" risks abstraction; redeemed by copper spoon’s concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief as physical weight transformed by transit. Risk-taking in silence-as-protagonist elevates beyond trope; prism terrace’s refractions reconfigure noise without gimmickry, charging closure.</comment>
