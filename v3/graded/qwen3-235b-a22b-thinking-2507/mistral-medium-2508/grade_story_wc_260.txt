<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "It wasn't forgiveness. It was balance—the weight of a tail tip... both fragile, both his to carry," showing earned micro-choices under pressure without therapy-speak. Slight BRR edge with Mara reflection but pivots to action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the "pearl of new growth" crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost. Orientation anchors by 50 words; lens holds through "shedding layers" density shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Misty workshop functions as micro-setting—fogged terrarium glass and cicada membrane directly constrain choices and charge the final "shimmering stillness." Sensory details (crushed herbs, damp earth) reflect Elias's healing focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency through three shedding layers, each narrowing options with felt cost (apothecary's silence, unblinking Lumen). Stakes tighten via "balance" trade-off, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "the weight of a tail tip on one side, the weight of a clear conscience" reweights redemption without moralizing. Final image of "new leaves" offers resonant non-literal answer to fragility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "scales shifting between emerald and ash, as if undecided about the truth of its own body." Rhythm modulates from dense reflection to clipped action ("He would go.") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "translucent as dawn on spider silk" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line "Elias stepped forward" resolves via action recharging "mist" motif. No figurative muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms redemption trope through specific constraints (cicada membrane, market return). Risk-taking in quiet closure—"shimmering stillness between regret and redemption"—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
