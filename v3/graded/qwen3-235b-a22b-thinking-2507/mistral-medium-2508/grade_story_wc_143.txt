<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (stealing sand, lingering shots), but "purposefully curious" label disrupts embodiment during high-stakes reflection; flaw slightly undercuts final renunciation's earned weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the shadow stretching toward Earth crystallizes irreversible loss with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through three pulse beats tightening the "dawnlit hush" pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lunar regolith and camera constrain every choice; the shadow cast by the bioluminescent pulse charges the final image by physically embodying transience against the "knife-edge" sun.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving pristine crater) tightens via the three chemical pulses, but drone threat remains offstage coincidence; time pressure alone lacks active opposition to deepen the cost sufficiently for 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No moralizing; "I was here. I saw" reweights the sand grain’s meaning into conceptual cost, transforming relic to "just another speck" without abstraction; theme emerges solely from particulates and photographs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ghosts of light," "crystallize in the cold") reflects inspector’s scientific-poetic mind; compression under stress ("He didn’t cry. Men of the space age didn’t cry...") modulates rhythm perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sun’s first knife-edge of light" exemplifies textural specificity, but "the kind that made a man wonder" slightly dilutes immediacy in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms moon-mining trope through hourglass sand and bioluminescent pulses; avoids sentimentality by grounding melancholy in camera mechanics and regolith physics, though "slow death of wonder" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
