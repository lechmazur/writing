<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) drive the pivotal seed-biting choice with visible cost ("teeth stained violet," "weight of a thousand years"). Embodied emotion avoids label-speak except minor over-articulation in "island would forget her name" line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: ridge revealed as living memory reweights premise with undeniable cost ("ridge’s pulse in her bones"). Causal lens holds—seed bite triggers revelation narrowing options, with cost proof in final image’s "violet teeth" and trembling ridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nightshade and knowledge seed function as micro-setting constraining choices (must plant pre-monsoon) and charging closure (violet-stained teeth). Sensory details like "taste like first question" reflect urgency while avoiding symbolism clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Monsoon deadline creates live clock tightening tactics; cost ("her own mind") is visible in physical transformation. Agency-driven escalation (cataloging dreams → biting seed) forecloses safety with stakes crystallizing when Manik forgets his daughter’s name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "ridge as memory" reweights premise without moralizing. Final "I’m the one who remembers" offers resonant answer via image (trembling ridge), avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity of memory as burden/voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("seeds pulsed like slow heartbeats") modulates under stress with fragmented syntax during revelation. Zero head-hopping; rhythm accelerates organically to "let the memories rise like sap" without elision artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "taste like first question ever asked" exemplifies high-density prose. Figurative language ("ridge’s empirical whimsy") clarifies stakes without muddle, especially in closure beat where "eyes reflecting non-sun light" charges final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-landscape trope through specific mechanics (knowledge fruit seeds, empirically whimsical ridge). Risk-taking in conceptual closure (CR) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though slight derivative familiarity prevents 9.5+.</comment>
