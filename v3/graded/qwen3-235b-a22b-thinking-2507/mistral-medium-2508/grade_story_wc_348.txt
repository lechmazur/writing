<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (sketching foam vs. building bridges), but grief resolution feels slightly accelerated; "dissolution" insight lacks sufficient struggle before acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "grief loosening like a knot," but the girl's appearance risks coincidence-complicating; cost is visible in the final wade yet slightly late-arriving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ravine actively constrains choices (kneeling, wading) and charges the final image; "braided streams" become the thematic engine, with foam patterns driving the protagonist's shift from calculation to perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (atonement for survivor's guilt) tighten through Elias's agency observing river patterns, but the cost of "dissolution" feels earned only in the final paragraph; escalation lacks visceral friction until the chrysalis release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing through concrete action (chrysalis placement), though "strongest connections" notebook line borders on thematic echo; final image reweights "divergent paths" into flowing possibility without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("polymers," "symphonically minded brain") persists under pressure; the girl's dialogue carries subtext through pitch and mud-caked shoes, avoiding voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bubbles clustering like forgotten sheet music" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose, though "symphonically minded brain" slightly echoes earlier "symphony of erosion" in proximity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via polymer science metaphors; chrysalis-as-biodegradable-scaffold feels fresh, but "everywhere" answer risks slight thematic familiarity despite strong execution.</comment>
