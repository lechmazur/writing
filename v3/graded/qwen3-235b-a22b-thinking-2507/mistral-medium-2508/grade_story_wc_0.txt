<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (control vs observation) act in scene; closure choice (sabbatical) earned through accumulated dust patterns with visible cost ("illusion of control" relinquished). Colleagues off-page but stakes remain personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "weight of the vial a quiet pulse against his ribs—proof that even in decay, there was a kind of creation." Accumulative lens holds through pattern accumulation; orientation perfect by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vial functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (dwindling dust) and charges final image ("tucking the empty vial like a relic"). Sensory details ("damp soil," "rattled broken glass") filtered through scientist's decay-focused POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's ritualistic observation under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "flood had taken... illusion of control." Dominant stake (performative growth vs patient witnessing) signaled immediately with "He wasn't here to mourn."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (dust mapping absence), not abstraction. Final image ("math felt soft... like butterfly wings") offers non-literal answer to witnessing change. Near-moral ("profound changes weren't forced") slightly dents resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractals where glass shattered," "spiral arms of dying star") with rhythmic modulation: long sentences for observation, staccato for revelation ("Not growth. Recognition."). Zero head-hopping despite reflective passages.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "ghostly tracery of a system unwinding" achieves triple duty (image/theme/character). Final line avoids overwriting: "beginning of something he didn’t need to name" maintains propulsion while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: neutron star physics applied to floral decay via butterfly dust. Transforms "appreciate decay" trope through specific scientific lens; risk-taking (observation as action) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
