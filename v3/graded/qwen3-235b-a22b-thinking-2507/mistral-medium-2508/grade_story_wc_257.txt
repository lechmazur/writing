<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests in micro-choices: unwinding wire for cranes after failed lilies, tracing vines with needles while releasing grief. Embodied emotion avoids cliché—"grief coiled tight as the wire"—with visceral stakes in the hollow crane meant to "hold light."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost: "Lena no longer mourned alone" crystallizes her renunciation of solitary grief through the cranes' accumulation. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each folded crane reweights the dominant stake (grief as burial vs. shared light), culminating in the final image of strangers learning creases.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s light actively charges closure: copper petals "trembled like real ones," then cranes cast vine shadows at dawn. Moonlight through dome cracks guides Lena’s choices (placing cranes where light "will catch it"), making environment constrain action and reconfigure grief into illumination.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure tightens through Lena’s agency: folding twelve cranes transforms passive grief into active "leaving," narrowing options from solitary relic-making to communal teaching. The cost—"hollow and waiting"—is felt in relinquishing control as cranes fly away, altering her tactics toward generative release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged objects: the artificial flower’s "genuinely artificial" nature reweights grief as something "shaped to hold light." Final image of cranes transforming into growing vines offers non-literal resolution without moralizing, resisting tidy binaries through "hollow" pendants awaiting bloom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: jewelry-maker’s tactile focus ("fingers tracing edges," "spool of silver wire") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control shines in folding sequences—"twelve cranes, each with a scrap of paper"—where short sentences mirror deliberate creases, avoiding head-hopping in pure single-POV lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("unwound," "wedged," "trembled"). Final line’s "snow fell" into "new sheet of vellum" avoids abstraction, but "hollow and waiting, like all the things that had yet to bloom" edges toward slight abstraction in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms mourning tropes through specific synthesis: jewelry + origami + observatory light creates fresh emotional calculus. Risk-taking in structural silence (no dialogue) heightens stakes, but "curtains of intention" concept slightly echoes existing metaphors without radical reinvention.</comment>
