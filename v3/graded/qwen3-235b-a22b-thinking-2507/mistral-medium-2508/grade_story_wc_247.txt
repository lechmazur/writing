<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Elias' signing ("*no*, then *yes*, then *now*") and Liora's shift from velvet to blade; embodied cost in shaking hands and camera weight. Minor gap in Elias' war trauma motivation despite "fishermen’s laughter... before the war stole their names" anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: camera "heavier now, like a heart full of names" crystallizes the conceptual price of remembrance. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation to "luminous peaks" of color-sound, though early lens ambiguity barely delays midpoint clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Harbor actively constrains choices—waves crash "with *color*" as tactical response, moon’s reflection fracturing/whole reconfiguring meaning. Vintage camera’s brass body transitions from "cool against her palm" to charged final weight, perfectly fulfilling micro-setting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when "shadow moved where no boat should be," forcing Liora’s lunge and Elias’ signing storm. Escalation driven by protagonist agency (camera as shield, net of silence) with visible cost in trembling hands and the camera’s transformed weight under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "thieves of a sort, stealing back what time had erased" evolves into "we remembered them back." Final image ("the forgotten began to sing") resonates without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence—the hunger entity’s unraveling carries undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "waves lapping... like a lullaby no one remembered how to sing" filters harbor through Elias’ sensory lens. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Elias signed *no*, then *yes*, then *now*") avoids syntactic monotony, though "thieves of a sort" slightly drifts into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("camera clicked, empty but insistent, and the soundless shutter became part of the rhythm"). "Hunger" note risks abstraction but saved by "vibrated in their bones"—peak beats avoid figurative muddle while accelerating momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: sign language as active resistance, filmless camera as memory weapon. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—remove the harbor’s color-sound waves and the climax collapses. Bold risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "faceless thing" echoes familiar horror archetypes.</comment>
