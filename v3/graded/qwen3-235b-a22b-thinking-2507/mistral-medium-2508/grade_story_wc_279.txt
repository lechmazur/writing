<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lior’s social perceptiveness manifests in concrete micro-choices (e.g., noticing the baker’s hands), and his contradiction—fear of chaos versus craving meaning—drives the pivotal interjection. Slight deduction as his internal struggle lacks visceral embodiment during the void-plunge climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the mess was the map" crystallizes the thematic shift with felt cost (dissolving tile, altered mural). Orientation anchors instantly ("mist coiled through the grotto"), and the accumulative/textural lens holds flawlessly through the chorus of whispers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The grotto’s acoustics and mist actively constrain choices (whispering tile, mandala’s void-reveal), while the tile flake’s micro-setting directly charges the final image. Only minor deduction as bonfires feel slightly symbolic rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density (humming tiles, burning flake) under the accumulative lens, narrowing options to "interject or collapse." Cost is undeniable (dissolved flake, shifted mural), though the "unlearning" backdrop lacks tighter causal pressure on Lior’s tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mandala’s transformation—"wings became bridges, eyes now windows"—avoiding moralizing. Hairline flaw: "necessity was fear" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting the earned final image’s resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mist coiled like a held breath"), with rhythm modulating from lyrical to staccato during crisis. One near-slip: "silence that pressed against eardrums" slightly overwrites the visceral moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; "lavender and possibility" finale exemplifies textural precision. Minor deduction for "pulse stuttered" (cliché) and adjacent synonym loops in the mandala’s description, though never obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms mystical tropes via tactile artistry (glaze fracturing, sands as "living tissue"). The "unlearning" framework gains specificity through the mural’s evolution, avoiding derivative safety with "tendrils of paint creeping toward ashes."</comment>
