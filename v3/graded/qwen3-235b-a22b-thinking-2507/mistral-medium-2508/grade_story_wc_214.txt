<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Eli’s spiritual curiosity versus societal dismissal; embodied choices like tracing star paths with calloused hands earn his final vulnerability. Slight thematic echo risk in "strength wasn’t armor" but redeemed by visceral cost (light warming wrists toward heart). Micro-choices under pressure—ignoring alarms to accept starlight—crystallize his hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Eli’s porous acceptance reconfigures strength with conceptual cost (station’s starlight veins, transformed lantern), legible in "courage to be porous." Accumulative lens holds—meteor shower’s density shift narrows options via his agency. Cost proof clear: "light seeped through cracks... climbing toward his heart" charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (bending light to "softer" glow during descent) and charging closure (whole again, pulsing agreement). Sensory specificity—ozone scent, groaning metal ribs—anchors urgency. Final image’s "lantern’s light pulsed" reweights prior fragility into earned resilience, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: Eli’s belief in stillness’s meaning versus others’ dismissal. Escalation driven by agency—tracing the star’s path, whispering "I see you"—tightens under Accumulative lens via meteor shower’s density. Cost unmistakable: station’s transformation forecloses isolation, with "porous" vulnerability altering his tactics (leaving as witness). One decisive deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "porous" strength reweights "armor" abstraction via Eli’s physical acceptance of light. Final image ("stars leaned in") offers resonant answer to "hush as invitation" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Eli’s "raw laugh" and "shadow as bridge" charge subtext through concrete action, not assertion. Complexity lingers in "strength" redefinition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV voice distinct: "universe whispered secrets only the patient could hear" filters cosmos through janitorial humility. Rhythmic control under pressure—"He closed his eyes and let it in"—compresses diction without losing texture. Minor "raw and unguarded" cliché in climax, but perceptual signature ("stars moved like slow dance") sustains coherence. Transmission dialogue carries subtext via hesitation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion: "fractured light over calloused hands" layers setting/character. Near-loop in "fractured light" repetition (para 1-2) is pattern-taught, not scaffold. Final image avoids purple prose—"shadow stretching... bridge between fallen and yet-to-be" recharges motifs. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" but closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor trope transformed through specific emotional calculus: vulnerability as active witness, not passive observer. Risk-taking in quiet closure ("stars leaned in") heightens stakes without gimmickry. Fresh inflection in "porous" strength—synthesis feels inevitable via lantern’s evolution. Derivative guardrail avoided; specificity (37 years, cracked lantern) anchors universals.</comment>
