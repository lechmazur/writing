<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between chasing meaning and accepting limits is embodied in her hands' memory versus the warped coin; final choice to paint "nothing" earns renunciation through tactile causality without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably in "she let the limits hold her" with conceptual cost (erased indentations, destroyed library); Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens toward the light fracturing climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tree hollow actively constrains choices (working by touch in sap-thick air) and charges the final image; coin's indentations function as micro-setting that shapes the entire action sequence toward collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally through the demolition deadline and the coin's fading pressure; agency drives the glass ceiling's creation with visible cost in the warped coin and "pillow damp with sap" after the collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the painted "nothing" as a non-literal answer to capturing meaning; avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in the coin's erased indentations and the library becoming sky before shattering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "her fingers twitching with muscle memory" and ink "the color of the hush"; rhythmic control modulates from frantic tracing to serene acceptance without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "river of gold fracturing" slightly dilutes momentum, but zero loops; propulsion remains clean through tactile verbs like "blades scoring the wood" until the ink-drying closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms artistry tropes via the tactile coin puzzle and "painting nothing"; emotional specificity in sap-damp pillow avoids abstraction while the warped coin delivers fresh conceptual cost.</comment>
