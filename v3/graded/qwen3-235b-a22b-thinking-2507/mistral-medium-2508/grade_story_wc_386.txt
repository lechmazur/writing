<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena’s interior contradiction—salvaging truth while wrestling her mother’s memory—drives her micro-choices (pressing hands to globe, sharing locket). Embodied emotion avoids cliché; widow’s "hope thick as grief" crystallizes irreversible change with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: widow’s lighter steps and Lena’s "windows" realization reconfigure grief’s meaning with visceral cost (tears on shivering glass). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks when candlelight floods the globe, rewiring stakes through sensory accretion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice shrine constrains every choice: melted snow globe’s warped glass forces reinterpretation of memory. Final image (glacier’s laughter) charges the micro-setting, making environment indispensable to closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lena’s agency—decoding the cameo appearances shifts widow’s focus from loss to survival. Cost is legible in the widow’s trembling hands and the locket’s "jagged edge," reweighting grief under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through salvageable objects (kelp net, rusted locket), not moralizing. Final line—"light always worth the salvaging"—reweights wreckage as revelation without stating a moral, earning resonance through Lena’s tactile choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dead seeped through cracks, voices the color of old silver." Voice modulates under pressure—short sentences when glacier groans—yet avoids uniform tics. "Borrowed starlight" metaphor risks cliché but fits Lena’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "heat of grief warped winter into something unrecognizable yet alive" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing loses 0.2, but final line’s cadence ("cracks were how light got in") redeems closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via salvage logic: melted snow globe reveals truth only through distortion. Emotional specificity (widow seeing child, not husband) avoids abstraction, with Lena’s "purest things rising like air from drowned lungs" as fresh inflection.</comment>
