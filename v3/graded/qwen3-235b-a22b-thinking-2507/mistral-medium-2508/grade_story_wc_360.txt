<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (collecting vs. changing via emotions) drive the climax; "splinter he couldn’t stop worrying" embodies grief without labels. Final surrender to transposed empathy earns visible cost through physical dissolution of borrowed voices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stars "unfolding" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (identity dissolution). Accumulative lens holds as emotional density tightens options—no causality breaks, cost legible in "weight of transposed hearts settled into his bones".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Workshop functions as active constraint: lead type whispers, topaz dust falls during transformation. Halo fragment’s physicality charges the ending—"dissolved into ink on fingertips" reweights prior mechanics. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake tightening when press prints Elias’s unrecognized emotion narrows options to surrender. Agency-driven escalation (pressing palm to fragment) forces the cost—transposed hearts settling into bones—unmistakable in the final image’s weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete evolution: "mathematics of emotion" becomes stars speaking in feelings. Final line avoids moralizing while reweighting widow’s question—"You were never the printer"—as resonant, non-literal answer to the central quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "topaz dust rained... glittering in dim light"; rhythm shifts from clinical ("frequency just below hearing") to visceral ("storm") under pressure. No head-hopping, elision taught early via vanishing stars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ink on the page moved" does triple duty (action/metaphor/plot). Final beat avoids figurative muddle—"stars began to speak back. Not in words. In feelings."—with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via letterpress specificity: emotional transference mechanics feel fresh through "transposed empathy." Avoids abstraction with workshop textures ("cadence of a grieving widow clinging like wet silk").</comment>
