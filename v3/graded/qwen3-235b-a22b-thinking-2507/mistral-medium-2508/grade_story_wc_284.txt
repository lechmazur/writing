<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("prudence whispered no; daring hissed yes") and embodied trauma (burns, tracking eye) drive the pillbox choice. Slight over-articulation in "prudence had always been her armor" edges toward label-speak but avoids diagnostic phrasing. Final renunciation of the pillbox earns visible cost through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Spring was coming. And so, it seemed, she was" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (the thawed river of resolve). Accumulative lens holds—mist density and pillbox weight accumulate pressure without causal turns. Orientation anchors by word 30 ("Zephyr Bluff," "burned spy"), avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mist actively swallows sound and footsteps, constraining Lena's hiding tactics. The pillbox as micro-setting charges the final image (left on roots for thaw to erase). "Thawing earth" motif shifts from obstacle to metaphor for courage, but spring's "tilt" lacks tactical pressure beyond lyrical weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re-engaging vs. endurance) tightens through pillbox opening—Lena's agency narrows options from avoidance to commitment. Cost is legible in "the part of her that had survived the fire" (conceptual price of identity revival). Escalation driven by sensory accumulation (mist, pillbox weight) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unused courage" motif reweighted by final line: "courage wasn't unused. It was just waiting for the ice to break." Avoids moralizing—resonance built from pillbox abandonment and thawing snow. No thematic echo; complexity in "debt paid in first step forward" rejects simplistic binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: spy's tactical awareness ("breath shallow enough to avoid misting air") blends with lyrical introspection. Minor register drift in "prudence/daring" metaphor during high-stress crouch, but rhythmic control elevates pressure ("mist took him before he could reply"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly at pillbox reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("silvered stains of a hundred fires she’d barely outrun"). Slight overwriting in opening ("ghost of last winter’s ice") but payoff in "thaw erase the rest" justifies lyricism. Final line’s "ice to break" crystallizes motif without muddle—closure image sharpened by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes via specificity: snow-coded messages, pillbox as emotional relic, "vouchsafe" as active verb. Fresh inflection in "unused courage" reframing avoids safety middle. Authenticity in burned-cheek detail; emotional specificity ("green things struggling upward") grounds universals. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
