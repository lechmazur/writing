<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete micro-choices (tucking lavender beside weeping photo, pulse steadying for shutter), but final choice lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet slightly untested under pressure despite "perceptively calm" trait shaping actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the shutter click reconfigures collective grief into guidance. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: layered photographs tighten into the final constellation image where the town’s unspoken pain becomes visible art.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lavender field and map case function as micro-setting: plucking sprigs charges the photo-tucking beat, while the case’s evolving weight directly shapes the final image ("lighter though nothing removed"). Ruins’ vines climbing like "stitches in a wound" charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting pain) tightens when the butterfly lands on the fence, forcing the archivist’s decisive framing. Cost is legible in the town carrying the factory’s whistle "in its ribs," though escalation leans slightly passive as she waits for light rather than actively alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "healing wasn’t subtraction, but rearrangement" crystallizes through the layered photographs. Final image of "arcs of reaching hands—black, white, and endless" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("lavender field like a breath held too long"), with rhythm modulating under pressure ("pulse steady" for shutter click). No head-hopping; compression ("Perceptively calm, she waited") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "click echoed softer than the factory’s ghost-whistle" shows masterful rhythm. One near-slip: "her work was subtle: she collected moments..." risks explanatory interiority, but "reframed them until hurt became art" rescues it with concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through specific synthesis: photographing "arcs of strangers’ hands" as healing tool feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal beats) heightens stakes, though "masterpiece" phrasing edges toward template without sufficient friction.</comment>
