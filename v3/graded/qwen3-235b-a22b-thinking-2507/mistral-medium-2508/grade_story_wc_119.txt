<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("didn't believe in fate" vs orchestrating through fortunes) drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied emotion via trembling hands/ink rituals avoids therapy-speak; daughter interaction crystallizes status dynamics with visible cost in ticket transfer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "lighthouse dark behind him... silence another kind of warning" reconfigures options under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors by line 25; lens clarity held through final slip's "tide brings what was already lost."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresnel lens and inkwell constrain choices (writing specs as fortunes) and charge final image ("rhythm of tracks... steady turn of lens"); sensory details filtered through keeper's priorities (saltwater on oilskin, incense smoke curling) avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Chen's agency: transferring film via daughter escalates pressure under Accumulative lens; cost legible in abandoned lighthouse ("silence another kind of warning") though micro-tension could deepen daughter's hesitation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "open secrets" manifested in fortunes reweighted by final slip ("What you seek was never hidden"); avoids moralizing while offering resonant answer via "tide brings what was already lost" closure image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce") with rhythmic control; fortune slips create patterned elision taught early and paid off in final slips; no head-hopping despite reflective fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("the hum you ignore will one day sing your name" compresses plot/theme); figurative language ("smoke curling like question marks") serves pressure without muddle in peak escape beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms spy trope through specific "open secrets" mechanics; fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper/fortune writer/spy feels inevitable; risk-taking (fortune slips as data transfer) heightens stakes without gimmickry ("transposing life into a new key").</comment>
