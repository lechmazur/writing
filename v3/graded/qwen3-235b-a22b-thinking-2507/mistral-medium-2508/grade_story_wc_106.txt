<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (thief vs. destiny-seeker) manifest in micro-choices like exploiting the wilting peony, but the ledger's "carry the dark" cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in her final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when she becomes the moment, but the stationmaster's sudden fade lacks causal friction—his pistol threat dissolves without altering her choice, weakening the felt cost of "carrying the dark."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonbeams and flower arrangements function as micro-setting that constrain choices (lock-picking via petal shifts) and charge the final image—her run toward the horizon lit by stolen light makes environment inseparable from thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liora's agency (memorizing blooms to exploit the wilting peony), but the stationmaster's passive dissolution during the climax undercuts pressure—his warning of imminent doom resolves via coincidence rather than her tactical choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror's revelation that stolen moments are countdowns, culminating in the resonant final image where light remains—a non-literal answer to "stealing time" that avoids moralizing while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gilded edge," "light caught a subject’s unguarded breath") persists under pressure; rhythmic compression during the lock-pick ("poppy left, dahlia tilted") heightens stakes without sacrificing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high density in phrases like "moonbeams inside *moved*, twisting into shapes" where syntax mirrors action. Minor register drift in "something older and hungrier" slightly muddles the mirror's threat but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of heist tropes via time-as-flower-codes transforms clichés; the emotional truth of craving "the almost-gone" feels earned through specific mechanics (countdown portraits, moonbeam physics) rather than abstract longing.</comment>
