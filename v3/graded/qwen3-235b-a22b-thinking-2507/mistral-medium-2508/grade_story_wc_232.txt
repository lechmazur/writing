<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in micro-choices: map-dealer rationality vs. chip-fueled faith. Final choice to face the child's sob earns cost through "twenty-three years late" realization. Only minor flaw: profession feels slightly decorative beyond shop name.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: wet ink on cavern map reconfigures promises as living things. Creek's rise tightens options causally. Minor deduction: water's threat dissipates too cleanly after door closes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cavern blooms aren't backdrop but active constraint—their residue coats Elias's skin, charging the final image. Every detail (mint, limestone, bioluminescence) guides choice or perception. Micro-setting as essential engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize perfectly around one choice: ink-stained maps vs. child's sob. Creek's rise escalates pressure causally. Slight deduction: ants' guidance feels convenient rather than earned complication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wet ink reframing promises as active forces—no moralizing. Final image ("ink was still wet") delivers non-literal answer to "lost doors" question. Avoids sentimentality through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: map-dealer precision colors descriptions ("carapaces iridescent as oil slicks"). Zero filter verbs; syntax compresses under pressure ("He exhaled, slow."). Voice modulates from clinical to transcendent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances the journey. "Foxfire trapped in metal" exemplifies fresh density. Only microscopic flaw: "patience running out" anthropomorphizes creek slightly beyond Elias's lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms magic-doorway trope via printer's grave and type-foundry mechanics. Emotional truth in "child's sob" ambiguity outweighs surface novelty. Risk of no chip-explanation pays off through earned resonance.</comment>
