<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between immortal boredom and curiosity is clear, but micro-choices lack layered hesitation during the drop; "boredom was a slow poison" states rather than embodies the conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with "Goodbye wasn’t an ending," but orientation debt past 120 words triggers -0.4 penalty despite functional disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains every choice—ice pillar contact, spatial mutiny—and charges the final image; "fractal ice" and "copper vein" transform from tools to thematic anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (release vs. eternity) tighten through magnetic pull "unmaking harm," but the cost of "unmaking harm" feels abstract until the copper vein’s return crystallizes conceptual sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"First honest thing he’d ever said" reweights goodbye without moralizing; the amulet’s curse-to-door shift earns thematic resonance through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("geometry gone feral," "magnetic fields were the escondite’s language") modulates rhythm under pressure; no head-hopping despite cosmic scale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with "spatial mutiny" cadence shift, but "boredom was a luxury for mortals; for him, it was a slow poison" contains a comma splice weakening opening authority.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesizes geometry and grief through "curse as curiosity"; risk-taking in making abstract concepts visceral (e.g., "light into knives") heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
