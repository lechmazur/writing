<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("doesn't believe in ghosts" yet feels locket's heartbeat), embodied via "dusty fingers" and "pulse quickening." Flaw: minimal struggle when opening locket reduces earned cost; crowd reactions feel externally imposed rather than pressure-tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "steady pulse" reconfigures mystery into listening with conceptual cost ("voice she hadn't earned"). Orientation flawless by line 15. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—each sensory addition tightens emotional coil without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as active micro-setting: rusted mailbox constrains choice (Mira follows the clang), locket-as-tool charges final image ("steady pulse" mending the world). Minor physics slip: "cold metal" contradicts "rising heat" without justification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can listening heal loss?) escalates through textural accumulation: mailbox clang → photograph → letter → courtyard replies. Cost legible in "weight of a voice she hadn't earned," but crowd's instant unity ("gasped as one") undermines earned pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "tick-tick" → "steady pulse" without moralizing. Final line ("curator’s work never done") resonates as non-literal answer to "healing through listening." Avoids pitfalls but Mrs. Delgado's exposition ("vanished since '89") edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink the color of old blood," "dusty fingers") and rhythmic control excel. Crowd dialogue flattens into chorus ("gasped as one"), losing individual voice texture during peak pressure—minor slippage in voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("frayed envelope," "cold metal"). "Mosaic of hope and grief" borders on abstraction in high-pressure beat, preventing 9+. Final image’s "air stayed soft" avoids sentimentality through concrete cause ("something broken begins to mend").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: locket holding "sound of home" transforms haunted-object trope. Specificity (thrift-store curator, rusted blue mailbox) avoids generality. Risk-taking in making listening the active verb elevates stakes without gimmickry; "tick-tick" motif feels inevitable.</comment>
