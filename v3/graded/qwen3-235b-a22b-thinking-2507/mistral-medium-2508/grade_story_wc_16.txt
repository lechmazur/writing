<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("carefully reckless") manifests in singing choice; embodied cost in shattered inkwell; no diagnostic labels during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (inkwell shattering); Accumulative lens holds through cadence shift to "archive alive with whispers."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Indigo mist weaving through shelves charges final image; micro-setting (shard in pocket) constrains choice by embodying truth's sharpness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via emissaries' approaching torches; cost legible in "inkwell shattered" but dominant stake slightly abstract despite visceral countdown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing until borderline thematic echo ("the point was the trust"); redeemed by "symphony of promises" reweighting silence as gestation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in "smelled of crushed violets," "breath tasted of iron"; rhythmic control during singing beat ("pressed her palm... sang") with taught lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "indigo mist coiled upward" exemplifies textural specificity; minor abstraction in "the point was the trust" avoids closure-impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Synthesis of linguistics and symphony feels inevitable; risk-taking (language as living loom) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
