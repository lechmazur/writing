<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "trembled, not from cold" as Elias shifts from observer to active preserver; micro-choices (pressing fulgurite to ear, splicing seed pod) embody "infinitely patient" trait with visible cost. Lacks sufficient friction between preservation desire and implied risks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "weight of the revelation" and impossible bell buoy toll; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density reweights rope’s meaning. Fog anchor by word 15 prevents orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass constrains choice (decoding mechanics) and charges final image (warm against palm); "golden dock under snow" actively pressures action via frayed rope in extreme cold. Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’s shift from decoding to active preservation, narrowing options to splicing the seed pod. Cost legible in trembling hands and "weight of revelation," but escalation lacks tangible opposition beyond internal doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope-as-archive metaphor without moralizing; final image ("knots began to sing") reweights "garden never fallow" as non-literal answer to preservation question. Avoids thematic echo despite "secret weavers" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "braided ledger of tides" and "fog’s hush"; rhythmic control peaks in decoding sequence. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but compression taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "fulgurite’s glass now warm against his palm" shows high density. One borderline overwriting ("hush of ocean’s breath") in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0. Final line’s lyric propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folk taxonomy and archival impulse; "thunder nail" transforms stock fulgurite trope through knot-lore specificity. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
