<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in sister's vanishing is clear, but contradictory impulses (hoarding vs sharing burdens) lack mid-crisis embodiment; micro-choices emerge only at climax, missing earlier tension under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "words dissolved like smoke" crystallizes the burden shift; Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to the ledger's transformation, reweighting stakes via visible ink-to-image shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Observatory gears and daylily constrain choices (telegram handling, lens adjustments), charging the final blooming image; sensory details like "brass gears whispering" reflect urgency but slightly over-rely on visual during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: his refusal to "listen" forecloses isolation as the variable stars align; the cost—"words hoarded for years dissolved"—reconfigures tactics via the ledger's violent transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the daylily's evolution from brittle telegram to blooming flower reweights "shared burdens" without moralizing; final line "burdens were meant to bloom" resonates as earned wisdom from the ledger's dissolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in star-as-"wound" metaphors and rhythmic control during the telescope sequence; minor register drift in "fractured truths into coherence" slightly jars Elias' voice under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("ink warmed, the words unspooling like a sigh"), but "brass gears whispering secrets only Elias Veyne could hear" overwrites the opening beat, diluting immediacy without payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "shared grief" trope through celestial mapping mechanics; the daylily's metamorphosis from decaying telegram to living bloom synthesizes theme and setting organically, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
