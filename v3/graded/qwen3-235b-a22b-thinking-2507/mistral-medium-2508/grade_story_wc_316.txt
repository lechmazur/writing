<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in Kael’s physical reactions ("fingers twitched," "breath shallow") and the brain jars’ thrumming frustration. Final merging choice earned through prior causality with visible cost: dissolved brains and skull-splitting pain reconfigure his existence. Avoids therapy-speak by grounding numbness in tactile sensations ("ghost wearing skin").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: custody hearing deadline forces merging, with history’s rewriting stopping as direct consequence. Closure is Decisive Change with unmistakable cost—"pain lanced through his skull" and empty jars. Orientation anchored by 70 words ("floating rock dojo," brain jars established). Cost proof clear in dissolved brains reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (brain jars) constrains the climax—blood must drip on them to merge. Final image of storm drops as "blessings" charges closure by mirroring Kael’s emotional wholeness. "Moss-slicked edges humming" integrates setting into action, avoiding generic symbolism through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael’s agency under Causal lens: custody hearing tightens options to merge or be dissolved. Blood ritual forecloses split existence with visceral cost ("skull-splitting pain," dissolved brains). Stakes materialize concretely in the jars’ physical transformation, reweighting options through action not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness vs. numbness emerges through the jars’ dissolution, not declaration. Final line "defeat the numbness" reweights prior struggle as non-literal answer to central question, avoiding moralizing. Emotional honesty in "crushing, glorious all" rejects sentimentality while charging the dawn imagery with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: Kael notices "wet prints on tatami," "hissing" blood—sensory details filtered through his split-state urgency. Veyra’s dialogue ("Custody hearing’s in three days") carries subtext via clipped rhythm contrasting Kael’s internal flow. Elision of Schism backstory taught early and paid off in merging mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sound like tearing silk" compresses merging’s physical/emotional cost into one resonant image. Final line’s "blessings" avoids cliché through context-dependent charge. No figurative muddle in peak beats—blood’s "hissing" and pain’s "lancing" maintain clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms clone trope through visceral brain imagery ("pulsing in amber fluid") and emotional stakes (defeating numbness). Specificity of Schism’s scar and "tearing silk" sound creates freshness. Avoids safety middle by dissolving both brains—bold risk heightening thematic coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
