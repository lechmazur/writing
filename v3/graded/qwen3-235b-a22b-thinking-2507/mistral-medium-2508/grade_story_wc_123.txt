<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("credible curiosity" vs "observing never interfering") drives pivotal message-reading choice; embodied fear in "words settled in his ribs" avoids label-speak. Slight deduction for underdeveloped flaw manifestation when untying knot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("began to record the silence") crystallizes cost of knowledge with undeniable pressure; Accumulative lens holds through "breathing" conceptual repricing. Door creak slightly over-relies on coincidence but charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as micro-setting: pigeon movements via fountain rim and lavender scent constrain Elias' observation tactics. Storm recorder's physicality charges closure image. Near-9.0 but lacks one explicit choice constrained by damp flagstones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when curiosity compels reading the message, foreclosing safety; cost legible in "wasn’t sure he wanted to be found." Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens reweights "integrity in solitude" with visceral dread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of observation vs complicity emerges organically from storm-recording metaphors; final image ("record the silence") resonates as non-literal answer to "integrity in solitude" without moralizing. No thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "pigeons... wings rustling like pages left open in rain"; rhythm modulates perfectly with tension. Minor deduction for one filter verb ("he thought of") in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "needle that quivered at faintest shift" exemplifies textural specificity. Slight deduction for reflective fragment ("Integrity, he’d once believed...") exceeding ideal tightness but still advancing stance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms meteorological thriller tropes through unique voice ("language of wind into ink"); sentient storm concept feels fresh via Elias' profession. Risky quiet ending pays off with conceptual weight, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
