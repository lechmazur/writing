<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Elias' sensory loss reframing his work ("measured life in scents" vs "weight of what people carried"), but the woman's trembling hands lack specificity, bordering on gestural poverty. Micro-choices like pressing the screw into her palm reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: density intensifies through screw examination to "space between them" insight. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias accepting absence as map—with undeniable cost in "world was soft, air thick with possibilities too quiet to name." No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Water clock constrains the final action (adjusting flow) while charging the closure image; fog's thinning mirrors emotional release. Micro-setting mastery: screw's corrosion becomes "language of pressure and yield," directly shaping Elias' pivotal realization about tightening versus trusting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (deciphering meaning) tightens when Elias connects screw to "pressure and yield," crystallizing his stance with cost: accepting sensory loss as "map." Agency lies in his renunciation of fixing—opting to "read" time instead—foreclosing his old life with palpable weight in "measured it in the weight of what people carried."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: screw's "space between" reweights "ordinary miracles" without moralizing. Final image ("fog lifted. The day began") resonates as non-literal answer to central question, recharging "hush between dawn and duty" with earned ambiguity about what can't be fixed—only witnessed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless: Elias' tactile focus ("threads worn smooth as river stones") replaces smell. Rhythm modulates perfectly—longer sentences for contemplation ("how light bent around edges not quite sharp"), staccato for tension ("The clock dripped. The morning waited."). No POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fog curled through alley like breath on glass" establishes texture without muddle. Every line multi-tasks: "threads worn smooth as river stones" conveys time, care, and tactile knowledge. Final image's concrete verbs ("fog lifted. The day began") avoid sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms repair trope by making it about understanding absence ("time wasn’t something to be repaired. It was something to be read"). Sensory loss reframed as map feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, as seen in "blur revealed more than the clear" payoff.</comment>
