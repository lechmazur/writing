<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through concrete embodiment ("blood glowed iridescent blue") and contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. time pressure), though epiphany edges toward abstraction. Micro-choices like plucking seeds and listening to shards reveal values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "She knew. Somewhere, a door was opening" crystallizes the reconfiguration with felt cost (heart "heavier with weight"). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as memory density builds toward iridescent blood revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crater glass constrains every choice (listening, gathering, cutting thumb) and charges the final image ("warm against her hip"). Geode walls actively pressure her via shimmering memories, avoiding postcard description through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving fading memories) tightens via the cave's "breathing" urgency and sprouting seed. Cost legibility peaks when blood revelation forces integration of "thousand half-remembered lives," though time pressure lacks granular escalation before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete shards ("fractures traced diverging moments"), not abstraction. Final image ("seeds tumbling into wind, each a question mark") resonates as non-literal answer to "why paths disappear," avoiding moralizing despite near-miss with "paths disappeared so new ones could be found."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature is impeccable: memories "hummed," seeds "spelled hurry in older language," fear "sighed in relief." Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("opalescent mist") to urgent ("Time was a thief") without head-hopping, taught early through transliteration motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "clinking like bones in diviner’s bag" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "*Of course,* she thought" during blood revelation slightly dulls immediacy, but closure lines ("sea foam curled like an old friend") achieve textural perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes via geode physics and "transliterating emotions into colors." The iridescent cave’s sentient gloom charging the protagonist’s blood is bold yet inevitable, synthesizing setting/concept into emotional specificity that avoids quirkiness.</comment>
