<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (pressing paper to chest), but Lira’s sudden arrival lacks sufficient motivation groundwork; her salt-stiff coat hints at backstory but the “dust told me” line risks feeling convenient without prior sensory setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with “dust learned how to wait,” reconfiguring the famine’s meaning through visible cost (Elias’s disappearance), though the Ministry’s abrupt off-page resolution slightly undermines causal pressure at the climax beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: the radio’s fading glow dictates broadcast timing, while the alcove’s mist and dust become tactile conduits for theme, charging the final image where dust “shimmered” and later “learned to listen.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency (inviting Lira in), tightening the dominant conflict—cultural survival—into a single resonant act; cost is palpable in his disappearance, though the Ministry’s off-page role weakens causal escalation slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions (“dust on fingers remember how to whisper”), culminating in the final line’s non-literal answer: resilience lives in waiting, not feasts, with no moralizing to mar its earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“mist coiled... thick as regret”) and rhythmic control persist under pressure, with lyric compression (“the dust needed to learn how to tell its own stories”) taught early and paid off in the closure’s charged silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density and propulsion marred by one near-duplicate (“ink on paper wasn’t enough; the dust needed...”) in a high-pressure beat; otherwise flawless texture, with “stubborn glow” crystallizing voice without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through specific, lived detail (orchestra copyist’s quill, salt-rotted docks), with the dust’s agency feeling inevitable in hindsight and risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
