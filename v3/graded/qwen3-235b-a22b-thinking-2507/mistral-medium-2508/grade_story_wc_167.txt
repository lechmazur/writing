<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in stone ritual—both "forgotten promise" and deliberate tool—without therapy-speak. Daughter’s absence charges micro-choices ("reaching for the next stone"), but "quiet certainty" slightly abstracts embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the harbor would forget... but Elias would know" crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—mist thickening and gull cry escalate pressure without causal breaks, reweighting transience as the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atrium’s glass walls literally constrain Elias’s ritual ("ripples trembled against the glass"), and the final "damp prints" charge closure. Every sensory detail (salt air, groaning wood) filters through his glazier bias, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten as dawn breaks: mist thickens, wind turns, first boat arrives—forcing Elias from ritual to work. Cost is visceral in "the harbor would forget what it had almost remembered," reweighting transience under Accumulative pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: prism alignment and stone ritual answer "why the mundane holds meaning" without moralizing. Final image ("reaching for the next stone") resonates as earned wisdom, avoiding Thematic Echo by grounding insight in concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is glazier-sharp ("wood groaning like old man’s bones"), with syntax tightening under pressure ("The stone broke the surface with a sigh"). Minor drift in "quiet certainty" slightly dilutes embodied immediacy at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dawn into quiet rainbows" and "mist parted like a blade through silk" showcase crystalline rhythm. Only microscopic flaw: "unremarkable gray" slightly generic amid otherwise idiosyncratic detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope via harbor glazier specificity—prism physics as emotional language feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing mundane ritual into profound resonance.</comment>
