<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora’s simultaneous pursuit and release of truth; embodied cost of dropping the ledger ("canal swallowed the past without a ripple") earns her renunciation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in ledger’s dissolution; Accumulative lens holds through density shifts (radio static to water’s silence), though minor radio intrusion risks convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Canal functions as active micro-setting—water reflections alter self-perception, marshes whisper secrets—constraining Liora’s choice to abandon the ledger; sensory hierarchy mirrors her emotional unraveling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through deepening ("lies were scaffolding"), not escalation; Liora’s agency in dropping the ledger forecloses her quest with visible cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final line reweights hindsight as "learning to squint"—resonant without moralizing; theme emerges through sundial’s evolution from relic to compass, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("canal cut like blade through old parchment") reveals Liora’s fractured psyche; rhythmic control intensifies as "water’s reflection showed her as she was—errant, unsteady."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("ink bled like old wounds... numbers thoughtfully clear") slightly dulls ledger’s significance; otherwise masterful density where every line charges atmosphere or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest/resignation via specific details (sundial pointing "inward," marshes as truth-space); risks lyrical ambiguity but closure’s cost prevents drift into vagueness.</comment>
