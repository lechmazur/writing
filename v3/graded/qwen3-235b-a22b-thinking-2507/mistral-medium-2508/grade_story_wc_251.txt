<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet rebellion feels earned through embodied choices (distributing coordinates, pocketing the pawn), but lacks contradictory impulses beyond preservation vs. surrender. The child’s question crystallizes his endurance with visible cost ("game isn’t over").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the library stood, patient as a held breath" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (council’s concession without acknowledgment). Accumulative lens holds—window displays deepen pressure, and the grotto’s humming chains force irreversible stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cobalt library and iron filings constrain choices (sealing doors with metal chains) and charge the final image. Sensory details like "ozone and old parchment" smell evolve with plot—mist shifts from atmosphere to active force swallowing cobblestones, directly shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: window displays foreclose passive resistance, forcing council confrontation. Cost is visceral—the hammer’s strike makes "teeth ache," altering tactics (workers lower tools). One meaningful deepening suffices, but "hush" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: origami cranes, filings aligning. Final image ("library stood, patient as a held breath") reweights "quiet rebellion" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—the child’s question crystallizes complexity, not a tidy answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices pawn edges and filing vibrations. Rhythm compresses under pressure ("He nodded, then gathered..."). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical ("mist thickened") to stark ("They lowered their tools").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances story (e.g., "filings vibrating like restless bees" shows escalation). Figurative language stays purposeful; final line’s "magnetic heart beating" avoids cliché. Read-aloud rhythm varies with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "save library" trope through magnetic realism. Iron filings motif evolves organically from tool to symbol. Emotional truth in "quiet things that refuse to be forgotten" avoids safety-middle choices, with risk-taking heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
