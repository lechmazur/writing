<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' contradictory impulses (survival vs truth preservation) manifest physically through "hands bled" labor and the dream sequence, with his final stance crystallized by Veyra's threat. The "rat who read too many books" backstory roots motivation without therapy-speak, though the dockworker dream slightly over-explains his resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the clerk's sanitized report juxtaposed with the ticking cog in silt makes conceptual cost undeniable. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sedimentary pressure buildup, though one tightening (Veyra's threat) barely meets escalation requirements for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sewer functions as active constraint—brackish water reflects the cog, rising tide becomes antagonist—and "child's shoe/spectacles/bones" micro-setting charges the drowning climax. "Rusted grates like slow, mocking applause" exemplifies POV-filtered sensory hierarchy, though "sunken city’s ribs" leans slightly generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs erasure) tightens credibly via Veyra's "flood the lower levels" threat, with water rising as visceral pressure. Agency manifests through Elias' siege-like preparations, but "progress" dialogue risks on-the-nose thematic echo, slightly diluting escalation's organic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "garbage lasts, stories rot" gains devastating irony via the clerk's report, while the ticking cog reweights "narratives" without moralizing. Final image avoids sentimentality by making conceptual cost undeniable through submerged mechanics rather than abstract commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias' voice brims with character-particular texture ("rat who read too many books"), but Veyra's dialogue lacks equivalent specificity—her "polishes garbage" line feels generic for a runner. "Pulse synced to its silent rhythm" slightly breaches POV lexicon with modern terminology during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless density: "brass gleaming like a held breath" merges image and metaphor without clutter. Minor register drift in "synced" and borderline-purple "sedimentary layers" in high-pressure beats prevent 9.0, though final "ticking" avoids sentimental payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms historical erasure trope through visceral sewer archaeology—salvaging plague-victim artifacts makes truth tangible. Emotional specificity (mother's death during council debates) elevates beyond cliché, though dockworker dream sequence echoes familiar resurrection motifs without full reinvention.</comment>
