<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("didn't believe in miracles, but believed in roots") manifests in concrete micro-choices (planting seed in sundial wound); final action (following roots deeper) earns closure with visible cost—the cracked sundial symbolizing faith rebuilt through sacrifice, not magic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (pulsing roots, mural vibration) tightens into sapling's emergence as Charged Poise closure; conceptual cost ("air smelled of ripe fruit... journeys resumed") legibly reconfigures blight-to-renewal stakes on the final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb setting actively constrains choices (roots guide path, supply seed) and charges closure—the "branches heavy with weight of what was to come" crystallizes the orchard's transformation, making environment indispensable to the final image's pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith vs. blight) escalates through Elias's agency: purposeful wandering narrows options to planting the seed, with visible cost (sundial cracking) reweighting "faith rebuilt" as labor, not miracle, under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (seed-in-sundial) rather than statement; final image ("some faiths... waiting to be rebuilt") reweights "interrupted journeys" as resumed with conceptual cost—blight's reversal demands ongoing work, avoiding tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal fingers tangled with roots," "air tasted sweeter") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in closure ("branches heavy with weight"), though "dormant life" slightly dilutes specificity in a high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels (e.g., "roots... pulsed faintly, as if breathing" foreshadows sapling's vibration); final line's rhythm charges closure without figurative muddle in the peak emergence beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope through catacomb specificity ("roots cradled bones of saints"); sundial-as-planter is a non-obvious synthesis where risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
