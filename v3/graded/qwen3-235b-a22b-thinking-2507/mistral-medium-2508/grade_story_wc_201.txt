<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trauma responses (locked knee, sealed throat) shaping micro-choices, though interrogator vision slightly strains causality; final counting choice earns closure with visceral cost in "ledger of absences".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "counting silences" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("ledger of absences"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory pressure without disorientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest actively constrains choices (roots pulling, sap-blood bark) and charges final image; "bruise-colored glow" to "dawn bleeding through leaves" reweights mercy's math with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stake tightening when basin vision forces realization that "mercy was in the asking"; protagonist agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens with undeniable cost in "mind a ledger of absences".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: final counting silences offers non-literal answer to mercy's math without moralizing; "spaces between numbers" motif charges closure without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("nerves a live wire," "air tasted like burnt copper") maintains rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping as UV forest's hum vibrates through bone-marrow syntax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "proprioception screaming" to "exhaled, and the forest exhaled" achieves lyrical propulsion without figurative muddle; final line recharges prior motifs with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of mathematical mercy and ultraviolet penance feels inevitable; risk-taking (math as embodied forest logic) heightens stakes without gimmickry, avoiding derivative trauma tropes.</comment>
