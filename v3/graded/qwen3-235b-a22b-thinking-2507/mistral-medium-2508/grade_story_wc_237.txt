<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lian’s trembling resolve versus childhood scars; the final choice (whispering the rune’s name) is earned through granular embodied detail like "scars hardening like flawed glass" and the grandmother’s superstition. No second character, but micro-choices under pressure—tracing on stone not parchment—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the storm’s "held breath" crystallizes transformation with undeniable cost ("scars no longer ached. They *sang*"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density (ozone scent, frost lattice) not causal turns—and the quill’s shedding reweights stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by "floating rock tea platform" within 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crow quill constrains choice (tracing on rock, not parchment) and charges the final image (crystalline tip in pocket, feather behind ear). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: Lian notices obsidian glints and pulse points during ritual, while storm-hum dominates calmer moments. Micro-setting functions as "environment" per 9+ gate, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as the storm’s "second breath" gathers, narrowing options to act before rain falls. Lian’s agency—shedding the quill tip, whispering the rune’s true name—drives deepening under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in "scars rewove into thread of light." The feather’s drop reweights pressure, making the final readiness ("to write its name upon the wind") feel earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "space between storms" becomes the catalyst for change without moralizing. The final image ("storm was learning her language") reweights the premise as scars transform from wounds to song, avoiding thematic echo. Subtext operates in gestures—quill shedding as refinement, not loss—fulfilling the 9+ quick test with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scholar’s precision ("needle’s precision," "obsidian catching light") blends with poetic urgency. Rhythm modulates under pressure—fragmented sentences during rune fracturing ("Her breath hitched"), lyrical flow in resolution ("each drop a period"). Compression taught early (backstory via scars) pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "the world held itself too tightly" conveys tension and atmosphere. Figurative language precise ("scars... hardening like flawed glass") with no muddle in peak beats. Final propulsion flawless: "scars no longer ached. They *sang*" crystallizes change without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rune magic as trauma transformation avoids trope—scars becoming "stories" reframes familiar theme through specific lived detail (crow quill, tea platform). Risk-taking heightens stakes: quiet climax (no storm confrontation) commits fully to premise. Emotional truth in "shedding as refinement" avoids safety-middle hedging.</comment>
