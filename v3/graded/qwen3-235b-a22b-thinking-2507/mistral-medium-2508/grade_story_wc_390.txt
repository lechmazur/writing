<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("Logic demanded run/Emotion demanded stay") and embodied cost ("unravel her from the inside out") avoid therapy-speak; final choice earned through concrete micro-choices like key insertion. Flaw: Monks' backstory slightly convenient despite BRR compliance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("nerves rewriting themselves into something less human") under Accumulative lens; "ice settling into a new pattern" crystallizes reconfigured stakes. Orientation anchored by 50 words; lens taught early via vibrational language.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively constrains choices (thinning ice = deadline) and charges final image ("ice settling"); lighthouse resonator evolves from "warning" to "hymn." Body-as-setting: "molars ache" and "bones vibrated" directly pressure climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (contain artifact resonance) tightens through protagonist agency: ice thinning forces vibrational matching choice. Cost unmistakable in "unravel her from the inside out," altering final tactics ("bought time. That was enough").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "sonic absolution" transforms from monks' theory to lived physics ("forgiven by physics"). Final image ("Let it listen. She’d left it nothing to fear") reweights premise without moralizing; avoids thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: engineer notices frequencies, not colors. Under stress, syntax compresses ("She turned the key.") while maintaining voice. Zero filter verbs; "dust that glittered like crushed pearl" reveals professional bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "reverse lightning strike" demonstrates high-density metaphor. Minor overwriting in "fleeting as a held breath" (Q7 −0.1), but rhythm accelerates perfectly during climax ("Her bones vibrated, her blood hummed").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via vibrational physics: "sonic absolution" as literal resonance, not metaphor. Freshness in "fleshly ethereal" specificity ("nerves rewriting") avoids spiritual cliché; marina’s groans as "language only she understood" deepens stakes.</comment>
