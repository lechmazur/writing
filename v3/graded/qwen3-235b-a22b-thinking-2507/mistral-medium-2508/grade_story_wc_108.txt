<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "adaptation hadn't saved her" vs blood ritual, but girl's wisdom feels unearned; vulnerability epiphany skirts thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("fear wasn't the enemy"), but ledger discovery lacks causal friction; orientation anchors clear by word 40 under causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Library's rusted shelves and stars constrain choice (ladder groan), yet "warped bookshelf" as setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical; micro-setting threshold met but not exceeded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through shell/cast/ledger sequence; "bleeding onto shell" trade-off embodies cost, though Jacob's absence weakens antagonist pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cracks that let light in" without moralizing; final dive imagery reweights vulnerability as power with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shelves sagging like old bones") modulates under stress; minor convergence in girl/Lena dialogue lexicon at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Clawed at her ribs like a trapped thing" borders cliché; scaffold in stunt reflection ("decade outwitting fear") slightly slows momentum pre-climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt doubling + identity theft; "smudged crayon decryption" risks boldness but pays off through charged specificity in cast-to-ledger causality.</comment>
