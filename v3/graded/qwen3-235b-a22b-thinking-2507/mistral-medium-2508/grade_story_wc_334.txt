<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "crisp ache" where nostalgia should be and embodied forgetting, but sailor backstory reflection risks summary; final choice earns cost through memory weight's return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the knitted stars and "weight of his own life" crystallize stakes with conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds via density escalation to the hum's vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse water constrains movement (knee-deep to ribs-deep) and charges finale; fairy ring residue's blue flare directly triggers memory surge, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s escalating memory gaps to the fairy ring’s hum, but "spaces held open" insight lacks visible tactical shift; cost is felt yet not leveraged for agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Spaces held open" reweights memory loss as trade-off without moralizing; final image of starfall weight answers "what if past chased him?" with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels—"black water," "iridescent residue," "waves dragging over glass"—but "crisp ache" edges toward therapy-speak; tension modulates via rhythmic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Climbed his spine and settled behind his eyes like a held note" slightly muddles metaphor; otherwise zero loops, high density, and "starfall" finale resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folkloric memory theft with cosmic horror; "payment for second chance" reconfigures trope, but "memory eater" lacks full transformation beyond sailor setup.</comment>
