<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied detail ("hands rough as bark") and micro-choices (mimicking terns) reveal motivation, but contradictory impulses lack active tension in pivotal moments; the singular focus on renewal slightly softens internal conflict depth required for 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("dreaming of roots twisting through rifle barrels") under Accumulative lens; the jetty's exhale and final image reconfigure meaning through accumulated pressure without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (tide timing, stone cracks) and charges closure ("poppies leaned toward the sea"), transforming environmental decay into active thematic engine rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through ritualistic escalation ("scattering seed pods like promises"), with visible cost in sleepless trauma dreams; agency in "Grow" command reweights options, though pressure could tighten more decisively pre-closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("tide began to taste of something other than salt and sorrow") delivers non-literal thematic resolution to "can beauty overcome trauma?" through concrete particulars, avoiding moralizing while charging prior motifs with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("cries sharp as flint," "bruised sky") and rhythmic control modulate with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, with elision (off-page backstory) taught early through tactile cues like seed-dust drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("stones slick with twilight and the last gasps of the reef") with minimal artifacts; slight cadence repetition in "brittle as old parchment, each one humming" prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "reclaiming battlefield" trope through specific jetty/bird mechanics and emotional truth in "slow, green vengeance"; roots growing through rifle barrels synthesizes premise into inevitable, non-obvious vision without gimmickry.</comment>
