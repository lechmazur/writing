<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: cataloging wind's weight yet embracing transience. Motivation ("honor what world forgot") compels ritual despite futility, with embodied cost in watching the spiral unravel. No therapy-speak; emotions live in actions like "fingers brushing the papery wing." Flaw: minimal backstory depth, but BRR-compliant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: his continued gathering forecloses hope with visible cost ("spiral was nothing but a memory of motion"). Accumulative lens holds—density buildup around "interrupted cadences" reweights stakes. Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in "knot undone" with wind's hunger crystallizing pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting: moss swallowing sound pressures ritual silence, wind directly unravels the spiral. Final image ("brushed moss from knees") charges closure through tactile constraint. Sensory details like "crushed petals clung to the throat" reflect urgency without checklist. Meets 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake (honoring transience vs. valley's false permanence) tightens via spiral's unraveling—a single deepening under Accumulative lens. Agency crystallizes in "began gathering new materials," foreclosing completion with felt cost. Pressure grows through the wing's disintegration; cost unmistakable in "knot undone" as tactics shift to noticing silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "permanence was a lie" shown via crumbling spiral, not stated. Final image ("wind was always hungry for signals") offers resonant non-literal answer to honoring loss. Avoids moralizing—epiphany earned through "memory of motion," with monarchs' absence charging the valley's indifference. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "cataloged the weight of wind" reflects esoteric realism. Syntax mirrors ritual ("knotted the moth wing into a loop") with rhythmic control under pressure ("He didn't need them to"). No head-hopping; compression during gust ("heartbeat... flutter") serves tension. Meets 9+ quick test with taught lyric patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "amber veins still warm from flight" does triple duty (sensory/theme/character). Final line's rhythm ("wind was always hungry") charges closure without muddle. Strategic density: "blushing stillness" compresses atmosphere into one phrase. No figurative overwriting—even "reproach" quickly grounds in action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ecological grief transformed through knotting moth wings as "signals." Avoids sentimentality via materiality ("crushed petals clung to throat"). Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off—"memory of motion" feels inevitable. Transformation test passed: changing setting would break the grotto's pressure on transience.</comment>
