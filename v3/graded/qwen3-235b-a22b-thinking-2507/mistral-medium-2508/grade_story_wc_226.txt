<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's defiance is embodied through tactile choices (bleeding fingers carving truth) rather than abstract rebellion. Her "innocently mischievous" past directly enables present agency, with contradictions ("heart lighter" amid destruction) avoiding tidy resolution. Diagnostic label-speak is absent; cost is felt in "hands empty" physicality during closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "the canyon would remember now" with visible cost (shattered spire, swallowed screams). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density ("mist thickening," "light pulsed unstable") culminating in the refraction reversal. Missing one persistent constraint shaping final tactics prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone-dust and charcoal constrain choices (climbing lattice, carving fissure) and charge closure ("began to write again... where light would refract it forever"). Sensory hierarchy is POV-particular: Liora notices "fractures in voices," not tourist details. Environment actively shapes tactics under ritual pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs ritualized absolution) tightens when chant falters after her whisper, narrowing options to carving or silence. Cost is unmistakable: spire shatters, elders' screams vanish into mist. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; the "refract" action reconfigures meaning with visceral consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: spire "splintered into many" refracts abstract guilt into physical shards. Final image of carving "cost of truth" on remains offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; resonance stems from bone-dust specificity, not philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Liora notices "vibration of coming chant," not visual spectacle. Rhythmic control under pressure ("breath came quick, pulse counterpoint") avoids uniformity. No head-hopping; elision (ritual mechanics) is taught early via "elders called it Needle of Absolution" and paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "refract" motif gains density without muddle. Final line "light would refract it forever" recharges opening imagery with closure weight. Sentence propulsion accelerates during climb ("breath came quick... pulse counterpoint") then deepens post-shatter. No figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms forgiveness tropes via bone-tower ecosystem where sins "grow" structures. Risk-taking with lyric structure heightens stakes (ritual as refraction physics), but "endless echoes" proximity to common phrasing prevents 9.0. Emotional truth in "mercy doesn’t ask for payment" avoids generic novelty.</comment>
