<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's poetic desperation versus scientific rigor; embodied grief in cloud-memorializing feels earned, though brother/mother backstory lacks micro-choice anchoring in present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the gondola touched down with a sigh" crystallizes surrender with conceptual cost ("ledgers heavy with data no one would ever read. It didn’t matter"), under Accumulative lens where density peaks at "sky was the remembering".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brass telescope constrains choice (pressing to chest during fall) and charges closure (tucked under arm), while gondola's physicality shapes every action—sky isn't backdrop but active participant in Elias's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias's agency: snapping the string (choice) tightens pressure, culminating in surrender as renunciation. Cost is palpable in shedding identity ("not as a meteorologist... but as a thread"), though external pressure remains atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "spooled wholeness" reprise: final image of Elias walking into starlight with "silhouette stitched from all the things the sky had held" reweights emptiness as presence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—"categorizing clouds by emotion" filters all description; rhythmic control peaks in falling sequence where short clauses mirror surrender ("He closed his eyes. The wind carried...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels (e.g., "dusty starlight" opening/closing reprise). Near-miss: "quiet violence as the moment before a storm breaks" slightly overwrites but pays off in closure's charged calm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through meteorological lens: "empty spaces hold the shape of what’s gone" becomes visceral physics. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making cosmic intimacy feel inevitable.</comment>
