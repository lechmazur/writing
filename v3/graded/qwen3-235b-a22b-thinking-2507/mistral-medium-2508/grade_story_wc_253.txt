<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena’s contradictory impulses—preserving grief yet craving release—drive her scream and whittling shift. Her embodied emotion ("blank face cracked just enough") avoids therapy-speak, with flaws compounding until the earned choice to share grief through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Lena’s scream forecloses enforced silence, with visible cost in her cracked expression. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure tightens through sensory accumulation (dust, turbines) toward the final charged silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The wind turbines actively constrain choice—swallowing Lena’s scream and framing the ending’s "remade" hush. Micro-settings (pocketknife, crumbling bouquet) charge the final image, with sensory detail filtered through her performer’s lens ("dust settled on brittle petals").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around carrying grief: Lena’s scream narrows options from stillness to shared action, with cost visible in her cracked face. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens through accumulating silence (empty chair, dust) until the scream reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: splitting the bouquet embodies "lightness" without moralizing. The final image ("hush felt like a choice, not an absence") reweights prior material as a resonant, non-literal answer to grief’s weight, avoiding false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lena’s performer lens colors all detail ("turbines turned like slow indifferent gods"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short staccato ("She didn’t cry") against flowing despair—teaches its pattern immediately and pays off in the final fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "curls of wood falling like shed skin" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final line’s fragments ("Not an absence. A remaking.") use non-standard structure purposefully, with propulsion intact through the scream’s raw release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via "lightness" as active labor (whittling), not catharsis. The scream’s futility ("turbines swallowed it whole") and shared bouquet split feel earned, with specificity (Harkin’s "fear/hope" flicker) avoiding abstraction.</comment>
