<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses ("wasn’t superstitious; was steadily curious") and embodied emotion via stained fingers/ignored cards. Quant’s confession lacks visible micro-choices during vulnerability, slightly weakening trade-off legibility at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "trust was just another unit of measure" crystallized through raindrop tracing. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density buildup in cultural patterns culminates in the final image’s reweighted geometry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight constrains every choice: droplets become "lenses" mirroring Elias’s pattern-seeking, and the final raindrop tracing charges closure. Micro-setting (measuring tape/glass) actively shapes tactics and final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping belief-system collapse) tightens when the quant reveals her brother was the guru—a visceral cost transforming abstract analysis. Escalation lacks one tangible trade-off (e.g., Elias risking something to hand over the tape).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "trust was just another unit of measure" resonates via chipped bitcoin’s weight and tape measurements. Zero moralizing; final reframing ("rules could be rewritten") answers the central question through raindrop tracing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("voices tightened when they spoke of liquidity"), but quant’s dialogue lacks distinct idiom—her "I need to know how it spread" could belong to any analyst. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless except minor backstory cadence dip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rain-beaded skylight fractured the dawn into liquid prisms" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in "steadily curious, a trait that saved him" (telling vs. showing) prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms crypto tropes via cartomancer-measuring-tape synthesis; "measure the space between promise and perception" feels inevitable. Risk-taking (tarot as cultural analytics) heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3 bonus.</comment>
