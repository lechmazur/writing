<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictory impulses (embracing transience vs. seeking connection) manifest concretely in actions like feeding the hourglass "moments" and giving the starflower. Final choice to merge timelines is earned through prior tactile details and micro-choices under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "the sand didn’t fall. It rose... because some things weren’t meant to be permanent." Escalation under Accumulative lens holds via density increase ("merging the lanes") and pattern break (dozen skies reflecting), with cost legible in the ferry’s shuddering transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The hourglass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (Lira pressing it to the deck to merge timelines) and charges the final image (rising sand defying gravity). Bioluminescent algae evolves from spectral glow to ordinary moonlight, mirroring resolution without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Lira’s agency: aligning the wheel against "unseen currents," then actively merging timelines despite "five minutes" pressure. Cost is visceral in the ferry’s shuddering and liquid silver water, reweighting the dominant stake (temporal navigation) through Accumulative deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "transient, resilient, and always moving" crystallized in rising sand, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "permanent" via "the space between one breath," offering resonant non-literal answer to transience without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers working by muscle memory," noticing starflower "from the air") modulates rhythm under pressure—short sentences during crisis ("She didn’t panic"), lyrical flow in resolution. Zero POV leakage; stress compresses diction without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "hull groaning with weight of unseen passengers" establishes setting/mood/concept). Information density peaks in closure ("sand didn’t fall. It rose") with crystalline propulsion and no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms ferry trope through temporal mechanics: "clocks run sideways" isn’t gimmick but shapes every choice (three mainlands, merging lanes). Rising sand image feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
