<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (spinning stories vs singing truth) manifests physically in throat-burning during song; micro-choices like plucking gourd show hierarchy of values with cost. Avoids therapy-speak despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "chest tight with weight of what she’d almost let die" crystallizes the emotional price. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the living arch vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Verdant arbor constrains every choice—from brittle vines forcing song to gourds as luck metric. The copper-winged automaton (micro-setting) charges the final image when it "caught the dawn," reweighting the premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency: trembling fingers to cracked note to burning throat, narrowing options until song becomes sole remedy. Cost is visceral—"chest tight with weight"—and alters her stance irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "gourds plumped" and "vines swayed listening" reweight the central question without moralizing. Final image ("world felt whole") resonates through earned sensory restoration, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "tendrils brittle as old parchment" and "scent of ripe earth... deep as first breath." Rhythmic control under pressure: shortening clauses during song climax ("She sang louder... the arbor seemed to lean in") heightens urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "copper wings catching dawn" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("heartbeat slowing") serves causality without muddle. Final line’s "vines swayed, listening" delivers closure with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "forgotten ritual" trope through tinkerer’s lens: songs as mechanical "key" for "lock of time" synthesizes magic with craft. Emotional specificity in "almost let die" avoids generic templates, though risk-taking stays within lyrical bounds.</comment>
