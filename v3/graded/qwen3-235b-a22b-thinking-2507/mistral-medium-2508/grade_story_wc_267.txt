<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs truth) manifest in Elias's micro-choices—pocketing the bolt, tracing discoloration, final stillness—without therapy-speak. Numb arm's returning pain embodies cost, but pianist's motivation remains slightly opaque despite sewn lips.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "nerves stitching themselves together, where the pain was returning" crystallizes the price of truth. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (bolt's cold→warmth, snow-as-notes), though pianist's return motivation edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress constrains every choice (forbidden floors, humming halls) and charges the finale—revealing "bruise just before it fades" reweights safety's illusion. Snow's tactile pressure ("hitting cobalt towers like notes") embodies the central conflict without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (safety vs truth) tighten through Elias's agency: following discoloration, confronting pianist, choosing to stay. Cost legible in "pain returning in flickers," but the pianist's sudden appearance lacks causal groundwork, softening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Safety was just a word for the things they’d chosen not to hear" emerges through shattered teacups and sewn lips, not moralizing. Final image ("fortress answered") reweights silence as complicity without tidy resolution, though "frostbitten hope" risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s voice—sparse, sensory ("rusted from disuse," "air forget how to carry vibration")—mirrors his silence. Perceptual signature (noticing discoloration, bolt’s temperature) stays consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances momentum ("snow slid from eaves in great sheets"). "Seraphically mundane" repetition is pattern-taught, not scaffold. Slight risk in "pulsing like a heartbeat" (near-cliché), but bolt’s context redeems it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted fortress" trope via sound physics ("unraveled sound itself") and nerve regeneration as metaphor. Risk-taking in quiet climax ("Elias stayed") feels inevitable, not gimmicky, with cobalt’s bruise-color revelation deepening the premise.</comment>
