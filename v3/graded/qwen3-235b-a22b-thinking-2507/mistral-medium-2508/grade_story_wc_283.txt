<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied (calloused fingers brushing jars) but lacks contradictory impulses under peak stress; traveler’s face in button triggers reaction but no visible struggle with choice. Final renunciation earned yet micro-choice depth insufficient for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: sand flowing backward crystallizes "we do" with undeniable conceptual cost (traveler’s screaming face in button). Accumulative lens held throughout; pattern-breaking button sequence reweights prophecy with felt stakes. Cost proof: "the cliffs—already brittle—might collapse" made visceral in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: fossilized resin glow enables navigation, weeping cliffs create treacherous path, and button’s veined amber charges climax. Environment actively constrains choice (slick stones at well) and reconfigures meaning (amber as both prison and pivot point). Final image’s button-on-rim embodies cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’ agency: cataloging buttons deepens knowledge, well descent tightens options, button discovery transforms prophecy from warning to choice. Stakes materialize viscerally—the ledger’s "hourglass breaks" made concrete via traveler’s trapped scream. Cost undeniable in closure’s backward sand flow and cliff stability hanging on his choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "shared wisdom" crystallizes when unscrambling buttons reveals choice over prediction. Final image (button left as offering) resonates without moralizing, reweighting "unearthed silence" as active surrender. Avoids thematic echo; cost lies in accepting human fragility ("we do") rather than fixing time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("wind howled through canyon’s teeth," ledger rustling like dry leaves") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "raw possibility" slightly exceeds Elias’ lexicon. No head-hopping; compression (prophecy fragments) taught early and paid off in button pattern revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("veined with fossilized resin that glowed faintly like trapped sunlight"). Peak-beat propulsion flawless ("threaded the needle with silver, lowered it into depths"). Slight figurative muddle in "veined with something darker" but closure image ("sand flowing backward") remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope via button mechanics: not lost but hidden pivot points. Emotional truth in "we do" reframing avoids abstraction. Fresh synthesis of amber (memory/prison), hourglass (village heartbeat), and buttons (rewoven fate) feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
