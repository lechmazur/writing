<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in "she didn't choose" climax; embodied cost in stinging palms and heart monitor contrast. No diagnostic label-speak, only character-particular metaphors like "clogged with stubborn certainty."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "her father's heart monitored... but hers was learning a new one." Accumulative lens holds through mica fractures and scrawls; cost proof evident in the pulse reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Library setting constrains choice via mica's light paths; "wet paper and old glue" smell charges final image. Micro-setting (lantern) directly shapes tactics and closure's "clover-melancholy and bright" charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: choosing blue then refusing choice. Cost legible in "palms stinging" and heart monitor contrast. Single meaningful deepening (contradictions as seams) reweights probability with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "luck wasn't a lie, just a language" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to "what if responsible thing is to leap?" through pulse shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "air smelled of wet paper... pressed between palms in apology." Rhythmic control peaks in "gold was victory... she needed to know if the other side was kindness." Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shattered hypothesis" metaphor precise and unforced. Final line "She followed" delivers propulsion without muddle. Only microscopic flaw: "theoretically rebellious energy" slightly abstract but anchored by whispering books.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms gambling trope via "arteries clogged with stubborn certainty" specificity. Risk-taking (lyric traversal of contradictions) heightens stakes; "clover-melancholy" light feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
