<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("crafting gilded truths" vs. physiological inability to lie) drives pivotal choice to write raw truth; embodied cost ("let the words bleed") earned through archive confrontation with his flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost: smooth zinc plate symbolizes unlocked voice after writing truth; accumulative lens holds as whispers reweight meaning without causal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zinc plate constrains choices (map-piecing, pedestal press) and charges final image ("smooth in his palm"); greenhouse domes pressure tactics via tunnel access under roots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative density: map fragments → archive whispers → writing act narrows options to truth-telling; cost unmistakable when gilded craft is abandoned for bleeding ink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image ("began again" with unread fragment) offers resonant answer to truth's purpose; avoids moralizing by showing "truths were seeds" as lived practice, not abstract ideal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Calligrapher's perceptual signature ("traced the veins," "ink bleeding") modulates rhythm under stress; no POV slippage even during archive transcendence ("letters shuddered, their whispers rising").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "parchment left in sun" shows state via texture; final line's "began again" recharges "began to write" with earned simplicity, no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Physiological truth-compulsion transforms calligrapher trope; "truths were seeds" gains freshness through poisoned soil metaphor, avoiding abstraction with visceral craft details.</comment>
