<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Veyra’s tremor vs. steady hands and Kael’s white knuckles vs. human unraveling; "muster the part of you that still believes in mornings" embodies flawed hope with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Kael’s signature drying while saying "You’ll break this one too" and Veyra’s "Probably" crystallizes the cost of fragile peace under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Terrace stones humming with dead names and lavender-gunpowder wind constrain choice; the clipboard’s "polished grief" charges the final image as micro-setting essential to redemption’s physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual pressure: Kael’s "sign my name to another grave?" forces Veyra’s "muster... mornings" counter, narrowing options to one imperfect signature with visceral cost in the bleeding ink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "installments, carved into wood and bone" without moralizing; the terrace’s "ghost of something like peace" resonates non-literally but "next time, bring stronger ink" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice distinctness in Veyra’s "river over rocks" cadence vs. Kael’s "dry wind" speech; rhythmic control under stress ("pen hovered... soldier coughed") avoids elision pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lavender, dust, the ghost of something like peace" achieves high density. "Voice a river over rocks" risks slight mixed metaphor but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms war-trope through tactile ritual: the clipboard’s notches as "imperfect signatures" reframe redemption as embodied practice, avoiding abstraction with "redemption... choosing to try again."</comment>
