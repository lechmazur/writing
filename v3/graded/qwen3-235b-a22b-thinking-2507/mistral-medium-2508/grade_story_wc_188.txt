<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied choices: "chanting born of loneliness" versus bone-thrumming defiance, culminating in the earned endurance of "world heavier" cost. No stock phrasing; flaws (loneliness) compound agency without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "world heavier... so was she" crystallizes the stakes. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density until the star-reignition reconfigures meaning, with mosaic’s reappearance charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Blooms function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure: their pulse guides Liora’s ascent, then "climb the walls like liquid fire" during climax, culminating in "vines of liquid fire" that reweights the fortress’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Escalation driven by Liora’s agency under accumulative lens: her filtering of ambient awareness narrows options to the mosaic discovery, then the rocket launch forces the cost of "heavier" existence. Stakes viscerally tighten via the starless void’s tangible weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "gave the dark something to push against" answers the central question without moralizing. The kerosene knot’s shift from tool to "purpose fulfilled" reweights light’s meaning, avoiding thematic echo in the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "dust smelling of crushed lavender and old gunpowder" filters setting through her designer’s lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—"The fortress trembled. Not from explosion"—avoids syntactic monotony while teaching the accumulative pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs: "kicking up dust," "let the rag bloom." Final line "one spark at a time" avoids cliché through earned specificity. No figurative muddle—every image serves the climax’s "vines of liquid fire" payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed place" trope via fireworks designer’s specificity: hope as active defiance against "gravity of hopelessness." Emotional truth in "world heavier" avoids generic triumph. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
