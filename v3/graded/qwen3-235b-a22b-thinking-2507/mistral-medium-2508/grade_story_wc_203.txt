<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through micro-choices (waiting in darkness, analyzing dust) rather than summary; embodied cost in shaking hands and the shattered laugh’s emotional weight elevates the renunciation. Ghost interactions lack sufficient friction to deepen the core dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—"silence rushed in, thick and final" crystallizes the conceptual cost with visceral weight. Accumulative lens holds through dust-pattern escalation, though the transition from discovery to unmaking slightly compresses the moral weight of Elias’s choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice (e.g., identifying fresh cracks) and charges the final image ("leaving the circus to its dust"). Scent of popcorn edges toward cliché but is redeemed by its tether to ghostly residue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Elias’s agency—dust analysis drives the discovery, the barrel turn forces the irreversible choice. Cost is unmistakable in the pendulum’s shatter and ghosts fading, though the "weightless burden" concept could tighten its grip earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pendulum’s preserved laugh and Elias’s unmaking, avoiding moralizing. Final line reweights "burden" into liberation without abstraction, though the ticket girl’s "thank you" risks sentimentality without sharper subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in tactile details ("dust smooth, undisturbed") and rhythmic shifts during tension. Ghost dialogue’s sparse indirection avoids thematic echo, though one slightly florid phrase ("tiny, forgotten acrobats") momentarily distances the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "geometric precision" and "oil that never dried" exemplify textural density. Near-miss: "ghost of laughter" edges toward cliché but is rescued by context. Final line’s propulsion ("mercifully, unwound") elevates closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis of repair tech and ghost-seer transforms the abandoned circus trope through dust-pattern logic. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes—the paused mechanism feels inevitable in hindsight, though the mainspring barrel’s origin lacks deeper integration.</comment>
