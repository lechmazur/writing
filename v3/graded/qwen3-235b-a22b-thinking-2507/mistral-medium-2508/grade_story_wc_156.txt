<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's interior contradiction—preservation vs. creation—drives every choice; her "methodically playful" trait manifests concretely in brushwork and nickel interactions. Final renunciation of certainty (stepping through the door) carries visible cost: leaving the physical garden for perpetual awakening, earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Liora’s acceptance of the cycle as "invitation" reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (exchanging certainty for curiosity). Orientation anchored by "sound wave garden" at 42 words; drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through escalating density of sound/awakening motifs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as active micro-setting: sculptures' humming mechanics directly constrain choices (nickel-triggered transitions), while "flower made of sound" final image charges closure. Sensory details are purpose-driven—vibrations narrow perception during crises, worn nickel edges embody decades of history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Liora’s agency: pressing the nickel narrows options to "threshold" realization; painting the door forces trade-off (certainty for curiosity). Cost is unmistakable—"breath hitched" at the blank mural, then physical departure with "garden swallowed her whole," reweighting options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "curiosity bloomed like a flower made of sound" reweights the central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite meta-line ("exchange what you know"); the fig-woman’s laughter charges resonance, making abstraction feel earned through Liora’s smirk on the nickel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices textures (peeling plaster, worn nickel edges) and sound vibrations first. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—"She woke—*again*—in the garden, gasping"—with patterned elision taught early ("ripped. Not the paint, not the wall—*her*"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical to fragmented during transitions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character. "Shivering note that bent the air" exemplifies high-density prose—sensory, causal, thematic. Final line "The first stroke is yours" propels closure without muddle. Hairline slip: "breath hitched" slightly clichéd but redeemed by immediate action (touching painted nickel).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis: sound wave garden as threshold transforms "nested awakenings" trope through mural restoration craft. Emotional specificity in Liora’s professional conflict ("preservation, not creation") avoids genericity. Risk-taking (cyclical structure) heightens stakes—ending’s "curiosity bloomed" feels inevitable yet fresh, passing transformation test.</comment>
