<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("tradition as ladder not cage") embodied in micro-choices: refusing replanting, naming "Rebirth" over embryo. Flaw: grandson's skepticism lacks specific friction beyond one line.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: blooming flower reweights tradition with undeniable cost (Council's authority undermined, elder's wavering voice). Causal lens holds perfectly from kite discovery to sprout unfurling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hot springs constrain choices: water syncs with pulse for unlocking method, mineral-rich air feeds sprout. Final image of glowing tendrils in springs directly charges closure. No generic "white room" description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single deepening ("Rebirth" naming) sufficiently narrows options under causal lens. Cost undeniable (Council's heresy charge, physical sprout), but Reconstruction timeframe doesn't actively tighten decisions beyond initial context.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("people listened" to plants) reweights tradition without stating morals. Avoids thematic echo: "ladder not loop" transforms from abstract metaphor to embodied vine knitting ruins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: gardener's hands, plant telepathy coloring all observation ("symbols burning like roots"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("steam answered, heat syncing with pulse rhythm").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "steam curled around fingers" does triple duty (setting/character/metaphor). Minor abstraction in "telepathy alight" saved by "chorus of roots" immediacy. Closure image crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope through plant telepathy mechanics and physical unlocking. "Tradition as ladder" made specific via bamboo kite script and vine-knitted ruins. Avoids derivative safety middle.</comment>
