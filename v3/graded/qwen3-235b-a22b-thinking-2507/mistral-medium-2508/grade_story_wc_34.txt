<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty to translate vs. fear of possession) manifest physically as the bolt plate sears his palm during the ghost's demand; final renunciation of encoding feels earned through grandmother's parallel and embodied cost ("throat raw with words he'd never sing").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: the child reaching for chalk while balladeer walks away crystallizes the cyclical cost ("work never done") with visceral weight in "hands empty, throat raw"; accumulative lens holds through density buildup to the bolt plate slam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The bolt plate functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices—used to encode symbols, then slammed to release the ghost—and charges the final image when slipped "cool now, inert" into his coat, transforming from tool to relic of completed duty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: each encoded symbol (spiral/question) narrows options until the ghost's physical demand ("wanted out... into him") forces the renunciation; cost legible in searing palm and abandoned life's work during the bolt plate slam.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reprise: grandmother's flower press becomes bolt plate, violets become chalk symbols, culminating in the child's new graffiti—no moral stated, yet "silence was enough" reweights translation as cyclical service with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "static hum of a broken radio" and "mist coiling tighter around ankles"; syntax modulates perfectly under pressure—fragmented during climax ("The courtyard screamed. Not in sound...")—with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension ("chalk lines deepening as if pulled by unseen threads" compresses cause/effect); figurative language serves pressure without muddle ("chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby" crystallizes the ghost's duality).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost story" through tech-poetic fusion ("server room" courtyard, "ghost in code"); emotional specificity anchors the fresh premise—the balladeer's fear isn't death but becoming a vessel, making release an act of mercy not victory.</comment>
