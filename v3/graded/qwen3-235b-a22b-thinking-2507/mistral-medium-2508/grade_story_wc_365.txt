<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora's simultaneous fear/thrill and embodied choices (pocketing shard, stepping through seam). Final renunciation of static-seeking earned by prior causality with visceral cost—spaceport dissolving as conceptual forfeiture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("She was the map now") lands with undeniable conceptual cost (spaceport unspooling into dark) under Accumulative lens. Minor causality gap: intercom voice's origin unexplained but serves textural pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Repair bay functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—shard found on floor, seam appears on wall. Final image (rain/burning paper smell) charges closure by reweighting prior sensory lattice with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: shard's color shift forces tactical pivot ("closed her eyes and let map expand in"). Cost is unmistakable—spaceport dissolving—reconfiguring options under Accumulative lens via density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "truth wasn't in the shard... it was in the weaving" avoids moralizing. Final image ("universe bent to meet her") reweights prior material as non-literal answer to "withheld truth" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of ozone," "weight...wrong in meaning") modulates under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early ("ghost of machinery") pays off in closure with rhythmic control—zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lattice of vibrations, scents, and faintest electric thrum" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("girders groaning like bones"); final beat crystalline with no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms multiverse tropes via sensory specificity (ozone/grease, green glass). Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes—"thrill of the next thread" feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
