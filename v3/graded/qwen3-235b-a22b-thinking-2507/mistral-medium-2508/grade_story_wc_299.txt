<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "confidently uncertain" embodied via appraisal failures and the widow scene. Micro-choice of pocketing cloth reveals hierarchy—emotional truth over monetary value—with felt cost in "chest hollow" to "breath steady." No diagnostic labels; flaws compound organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "road stretched out, an unanswered question" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost in "uncertainty didn’t feel like failure." Accumulative lens holds—the quarry blasts and dust motes accumulate pressure, narrowing options to acceptance. Orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (grille cloth) charges closure: "edges sharp against thigh" during drive reweights its meaning from trash to purpose. Quarry dust motes as "lighters" mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy perfect—roadie’s tactile focus on stitching over visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency: recognizing "After" scrap forces Liam to confront value beyond appraisal, crystallized in "I’ll take it." Cost is visible—relinquishing certainty for "space between notes." One meaningful deepening suffices, but secondary stake (quarry job?) underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "applause" vs. "after" reframed by cloth scrap and road imagery. Final line "he just needed to drive" resonates without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality—purpose as "quiet after" earns complexity through widow’s microphones and quarry’s "wound in earth."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: roadie’s tactile lexicon ("coiling cables," "stitching matched amps") modulates rhythm from reflective to clipped ("He pressed the gas"). Foreman’s dialogue ("Suit yourself") shows status shift. Zero register drift; stress compresses diction naturally ("gravel crunching like static").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "dust motes like lighters" avoids cliché via concrete cue. Minor paraphrase in "confidently uncertain" description (-0.2), but propulsion intact. Final image’s "headlights cutting through dark" achieves high density—simultaneously literal, metaphorical, and character-particular.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "midlife crisis" trope through quarry-as-excavation metaphor and redefining purpose as "space between notes." Emotional specificity in "learning to listen for what came after" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
