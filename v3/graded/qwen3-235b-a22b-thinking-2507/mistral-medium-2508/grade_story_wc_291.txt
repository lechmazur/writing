<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing ("saw them in the weight of silence"), but "the empathy he'd buried" risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied contradiction during the vision sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully ("Liora’s name had been spoken aloud"), with visible cost in "methodical heart a little less still"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lance functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (methodical ritual) and charges the final image ("tucked the ribbon into his pocket, beside the sketch"), fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation ("mist coiled tighter"), but Elias’s agency in deepening the vision feels slightly passive; cost is legible in his breath sharpening from "the weight of it".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through particulars ("a portraitist of the invisible"), with the final image ("somewhere, a child coughed") offering a resonant, non-literal answer to bearing witness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("saw them in the weight of silence"), but minor register drift in "the empathy he'd buried" slightly undermines voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, though slight synonym churn ("damp walls—not for balance, but to memorize the texture") in a mid-beat prevents 9.0 despite no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms face-blind investigator trope through sensory specificity; "furrowed hush" and quiet closure (bearing witness > vengeance) demonstrate risk-taking that heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
