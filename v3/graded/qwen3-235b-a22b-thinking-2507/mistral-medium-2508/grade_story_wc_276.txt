<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in his "cool-headed" pursuit versus visceral reaction to daughter's name; embodied grief ("memory hit like a wave") avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: rail spike's forge origin lacks causal tie to his core motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when he "let go" of the echo, cost legible in blackened stems. Lens ambiguity early (Accumulative/Textural dominant at end) prevents 9.0 despite strong cost proof in "the echoes slept beneath the weight of his silence".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (digging toward "soil refused to hum") and charges final image ("garden hummed"). Rail spike's physicality ("burned cold in pocket") shapes tactics without symbolic overreach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when he digs away from his daughter's tree toward silent soil, narrowing options. But "something else wearing her voice" feels convenient rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "voiced silence" as both weapon and burden; final image reweights "feral lullaby" into earned peace without moralizing. Near-miss: "silence after" risks abstraction but saved by tactile dock scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stems swaying in time with subsonic pulse" shows character-particular noticing. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing disrupts otherwise rhythmic control during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "air split like wet silk" demonstrates high-density imagery. Slight figurative muddle in "frequency that vibrated in his teeth" (physical impossibility) costs 0.1 in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "grief ritual" trope through sound-wave physics; rail spike's forge origin adds fresh specificity. Derivative risk in "goddess of echoes" concept mitigated by concrete river-reed details and earned emotional truth.</comment>
