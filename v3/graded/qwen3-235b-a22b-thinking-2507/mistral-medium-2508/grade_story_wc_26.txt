<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liora’s "half-empty" state driving her exchange; embodied emotion avoids labels ("softly deliberate resistance—like a breath held too long"). Final choice earned through prior study of detached emotions, with visible cost in her thinned shadow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: combined shadow "settled—no longer restless" with undeniable cost in "shadow thin but present." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of shadow footage; orientation anchored by first line. Cost proof crystal clear in curator’s observation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>River stone functions as micro-setting object constraining choices (offered on sill, merges shadows) and charging final image ("veins pulsing faintly, as if dreaming"). Library’s "petals of light unfolding" integrates action with tactile specificity, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early via stone’s "softly deliberate resistance"; single deepening (footage comparison) narrows options to exchange. Escalation driven by Liora’s agency ("understood now why curator lied"), with unmistakable cost in her altered shadow. Pressure tightens under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "quiet, stubborn sort of hope" reweighted by final image of stone glowing "like a heartbeat." Avoids moralizing; resonant answer in "some hopes too heavy to carry alone" with regret "for beauty of what remained" charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusk noticer" tracking "slow unraveling of shadows") with rhythmic control under pressure. Patterned elision (decades of footage) taught early; "softly deliberate" refrain modulates voice without head-hopping. Tension in lyrical compression never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multi-tasks ("smooth and cold, its surface etched with veins of quartz"). Figurative language sparse yet potent ("library sighed"), avoiding muddle in peak beats. Final image crystal clear with "stone glowed once, like a heartbeat."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "detached shadow" trope through specific lens of quiet hope preserved in stone. Emotional truth in "half-empty" Liora as vessel avoids abstraction; fresh synthesis of library as sanctuary for unbound emotions feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
