<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (capture vs. become density) manifest in micro-choices like shell hesitation; embodied epiphany via "landing was not" avoids diagnostic labels. Liora’s "what you return" crystallizes earned shift without over-tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "the landing was not" makes weight tangible after weightless fall. Accumulative lens holds—density accumulation reconfigures options via shell drop, no causality breaks. Cost proof in final image’s physical consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains choice (jump through bridges), charges closure ("shadows scientifically romantic"). Nautilus shell’s physical warmth shifts meaning from vessel to key, directly shaping Elias’s final action. Micro-setting essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency: "revalued the shell" shifts from extraction to offering, narrowing options to jump. Cost ("landing was not") legible in closure. Single deepening suffices; pressure coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from shell’s evolution: "becoming the weight" answers density question without moralizing. Final line ("live in its glow") resonates non-literally, but "giving back—differently" risks thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veins of molten copper," "breath curling like a question") modulates with stress. Lyric compression taught early ("spiral whorls etched with equations that weren’t meant to be solved, only felt") pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops but filter-verb stacks cluster at peak pressure ("Elias exhaled... He turned... The shell’s curl warmed"), triggering -0.5 artifact penalty. Otherwise stellar density; "molten glass" metaphor sustains physical logic without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes via "density as staying after burning," avoiding abstraction. "Jumping through—not down" synthesizes emotional/scientific logic, reweighting "palette of resolve" with irreplaceable specificity. Risk elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
