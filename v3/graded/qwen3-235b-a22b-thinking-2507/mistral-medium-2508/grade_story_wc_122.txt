<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s tactile yearning versus rejection of traditional music; drum maker’s archetypal wisdom slightly flattens relationship depth despite precise signing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "numbness was a door" reconfigures silence with felt cost (carrying broken needle); Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cavern’s micro-setting constrains every choice—vibrations through horn, hide-wrapped needle—culminating in final image where "quiet" becomes active listening, charging the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency: broken needle to palm-on-horn choice, narrowing options to tactile music; cost crystallizes in carrying the needle as "reminder silence isn’t empty."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "backward songs" as reversed grief, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights silence as "a kind of listening" but "filament of hush" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—sensory details filtered through tactile deprivation (grooves as Braille); rhythmic control intensifies as vibrations "settle in his ribs" without POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "pressure, a wave of something audibly muted" exemplifies syntactic precision; minor abstraction in "kind of quiet" barely avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms deaf musician trope via "backward songs" as reversed grief; specificity of hide-wrapped needle and Braille grooves creates organic freshness without gimmickry.</comment>
