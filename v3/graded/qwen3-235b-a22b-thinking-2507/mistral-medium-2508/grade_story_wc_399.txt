<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lysan’s interior contradiction—trained line walker yet sensing "this was different"—drives her endurance choice. Embodied emotion in "weight in her chest eased just enough" shows earned cost without therapy-speak, meeting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "I can hold it long enough" crystallizes refusal with visible cost ("weight in chest eased just enough"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the parapet’s fading song recharging the clearing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet constrains every choice—it hums, shivers, and sings to alter the clearing’s stability. Final image ("echo of wisdom hummed, stubborn and bright") charges it as indispensable micro-setting, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten accumulatively: prophet’s "sigils of flame" burning nuance forces Lysan’s active consecration. Agency-driven escalation peaks when the parapet’s song "settled like a second heartbeat," with chest-weight cost unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "wisdom survived—not in proclamations, but in spaces between" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights the prophet’s fire with conceptual cost (ash settling, desert remembering), offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of crushed mint and something older—like the first word ever spoken") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical density to sparse relief ("She didn’t turn"), with patterned elision taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension ("parapet groaned, then sang" shows causality). Figurative language stays precise in peak beats ("trembled like frightened things"), with closure image crystalline and unmarred by artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "line walker" measuring tremors between "what was and what might be" transforms preservation into embodied resistance. Risk-taking (quiet endurance over confrontation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
