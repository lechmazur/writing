<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's interiority shines through concrete details ("water carved rock—not by force, but by persistence") and contradictory impulses (embracing failure while seeking connection). Final choice to replant the seedling earns closure through prior causality, though Lina's sudden reappearance lacks sufficient setup for her pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the bloom's "death and miracles" reconfigures Elias's entire purpose with palpable cost (business collapse, transformed community). Accumulative lens holds throughout, with the seed's growth tightening pressure toward the resonant final image of hands clasped in the dark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The brook functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (seed planted where water "could sing to its roots") and charges the final image. Sensory details ("storm-born silence," "muddy boots") evolve causally with plot, avoiding symbolism by serving tactile necessity in every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguarding space for innovation) tightens through the seed's physical escalation, narrowing Elias's options from solitary curator to communal steward. Cost is unmistakable in "business slowed... stopped" and the lawyers' arrival with "something that burned," though the astronomers' role feels underdeveloped for their thematic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the corpse flower's "stink" becomes the answer to Elias's puzzle philosophy. Final image reweights "doors ajar" into "The answer is outside. Listen" without moralizing, earning wisdom through the bloom's visceral cost rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink that glinted like beetle-shells," "breathing" seed) creates unparalleled rhythm. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure—lyrical during contemplation, clipped during crisis ("A crack like a gunshot"). Zero head-hopping; every phrase embodies Elias's escape-room mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the brook swelling with sudden rain" advance plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor density risk in "furrowed like a dried scorpion’s heart" avoids muddle through precise biological accuracy, but the final paragraph's lyricism risks overwriting if not for its earned payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms escape-room trope through specific, grounded choices: the corpse flower's decade-long bloom cycle redefines "puzzle" as communal endurance. Fresh inflection lies in the seed's sentience ("breathing" glass case), though the "receptive" trait borders on thematic echo without sufficient friction in Lina's initial appearance.</comment>
