<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyssa's embodied exhaustion ("teeth ached") and contradictory impulses (guardian vs. liberator) earn her renunciation through specific pressure; librarian's motivation feels underdeveloped despite strong micro-choices like pocketing the pendant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden's unraveling into "a vast, breathing page" reconfigures light/darkness with undeniable cost ("weight of words lifting from her bones"); lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density buildup to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen garden evolves causally from constraint to "breathing page," directly charging the climax; recurring pendant's "hungry cold" enables the pivotal handover with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Lyssa's agency: her shift from waiting to laughter drives the unraveling; cost is visceral (world dissolution) and unmistakable in "words lifting from her bones" under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—"light didn’t cast shadows" reframed as "darkness, but softer. Like a friend"—avoiding moralizing while reweighting the central question with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature razor-sharp ("mist was new—a slow breath exhaling"); syntax compresses under stress ("Lyssa didn’t scream. She laughed") with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line charges atmosphere ("skeletal trees like a second skin") with high density—only minor deduction for "dimensionally homesick" slightly straining Lyssa's lexicon in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specificity: books as "dimensionally homesick," light's "thirsty" quality; "soft darkness" payoff feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing emotional truth with cosmic stakes.</comment>
