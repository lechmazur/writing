<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) act in scene during the fracture dive; final choice to plant sapling earned by mentor’s legacy with visible cost—physical transformation via moss. No therapy-speak; emotions embodied ("veins thrumming").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "echoes weren’t ghosts. They were instructions" reweights premise with felt cost (skin prickling, role shift). Accumulative lens holds; inversion timing creates tangible pressure. Cost proof: "moss on her skin shimmered" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moss functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (landing on arch) and charges closure (shimmering on skin, humming arches). Sensory details selective and POV-filtered (pilot noticing currents), avoiding white-room syndrome. Recurring object essential to final resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through bodily cost (moss spreading, veins thrumming); escalation driven by Veyra’s agency (dive, seed retrieval). Inversion’s "hour ending" tightens tactics. Cost unmistakable in transformation, though secondary conflict depth limited by scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "resilience was something you grew" crystallized by sapling’s bone-vibrating song. No moralizing; final line ("ready to scream back") implies action over passivity. Avoids thematic echo via concrete particulars (split seed, singing leaves).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: pilot notices rudder adjustments, upward currents. Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during dive). "Whirling silence" as sensory paradox taught early; no head-hopping. Slight lyric indulgence ("gathering of ghosts") offset by coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("roots twisting upward... sending fruit spiraling" does triple duty). Figurative language sparse in peak beats; final line ("scream back") crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor metaphor friction ("hollows like ghosts") doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "resilience" via botanical physics (inversion-driven growth) transforms tropes. Emotional truth in quiet transformation; "whirling silence" as tactile pressure. Risk-taking (sensory logic of non-sound) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
