<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete cues (trembling hands, chest ache) avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (pride vs. regret) act simultaneously during digging. Reflection block slightly exceeds BRR at 25% but alters present stance via the planted seed choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the ribbon binding the wrist makes "Why didn’t you read mine?" viscerally felt. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (orchard hum → wind chorus) without causality breaks; orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard/cathedral setting constrains the climax (planting "where light bends" through rose window) and charges the final image (apple bite symbolizing broken vows). Recurring ribbon evolves from taunt to wrist-bound cost with tactile specificity ("frayed edges biting").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by mender’s agency: digging reweights the dominant stake (understanding daughter’s departure) into a felt cost ("read the cracks" realization). The sprout’s emergence narrows options by crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure with irreversible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: deciduous vows reframed by the sprout pointing to the ribbon, avoiding moralizing. Final wind-chorus delivers a resonant, non-literal answer to "What did you see?" by reweighting the mender’s blindness with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via quartz-eye mender’s tactile/spiritual noticing ("rot beneath the gilt," "pulse" of earth). Rhythm modulates under pressure: terse digging beats shift to lyrical revelation without syntactic monotony or POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("bruised twilight" ribbon, "dried petals" bed) advances atmosphere without muddle. Final beat’s concrete verbs ("pressed," "whispered," "broke") propel closure with crystalline clarity and no figurative overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cathedral orchard as living wound transforms "deciduous vows" trope. Emotional truth in parental regret avoids generic templates through specific stakes (stitches on doll, frayed ribbon). Risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
