<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through compass/heart tension; micro-choice to count poles backward reveals hierarchy of values with cost ("compass digging into his ribs"). Daughter’s off-page presence limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis crystallizes when he turns inland—"learning to stay still"—with felt cost (unopened letters, daughter’s tears). Accumulative lens holds: sensory density tightens toward "spaces between the poles" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Compass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (refusal to paddle out) and charges final image ("pocketed the compass"). Utility poles evolve from regret markers to path toward redemption, altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: "counting poles backward" deepens conflict into visible cost (reading smudged letters). Moral calculus between flight and facing regret sharpens peak choice without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through compass/poles duality—"alignment wasn’t about direction, it was about showing up"—avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "navigating" into relational presence without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "briny tang of kelp and something sweeter, like jasmine" filters setting through grief. Rhythmic control under pressure ("needle wavered like his resolve") avoids syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("ropes frayed where they’d been cut loose—just like Elias’s promises"). Minor register drift: "merrily melancholic" borders on label-speak but redeemed by embodied context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms regret trope via coastal specificity ("kelp," "utility poles"). Fresh synthesis: navigation tools repurposed for emotional reckoning ("spaces between poles" as belonging). Avoids safety-middle with unflinching regret.</comment>
