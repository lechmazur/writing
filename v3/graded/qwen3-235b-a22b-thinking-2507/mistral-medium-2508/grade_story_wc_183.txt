<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wasn't supposed to remember") and embodied emotion (scales as "blissfully aberrant" proof) power the climax; sister's sudden appearance lacks sufficient friction despite strong micro-choices with the swatch card.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (sinking ship, "fog as door" transformation); orientation anchors immediately but ledger-page removal feels slightly convenient under accumulative lens despite ink-drinking poetic logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (emerald swatch) constrains every key choice and charges the final image; carnival ship actively pressures action through weeping carousel, warped mirrors, and fog-as-medium, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully through swatch application and ledger tearing, but "narrative threads" mechanism remains underdramatized; cost legible via sinking ship yet sister's seamless return slightly softens the earned trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (swatch-to-heart transfer) not abstraction; final "emerald threads" image resonantly reweights the garden without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite "stolen names" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cotton candy thick in air," mirrors "whispering half-truths") modulates under stress; minor filter verbs ("she saw") acceptable but "drowned world" cliché slightly dilutes peak-beat immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with purposeful rhythm shifts ("The ship groaned... The ship creaked" loop deducts 0.2); lush imagery risks overwriting in non-closure beats but "fog brightened" final line avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival decay with memory recovery; "blissfully aberrant" specificity and fog-as-door transformation feel inevitable. Derivative twin trope elevated through concrete stakes (ledger ink, weeping carousel).</comment>
