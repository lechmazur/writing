<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (hoarding vs stepping into memories) embodied through scarf handling; micro-choice to unlock restricted section earns change. Slight convenience in mother's voice manifestation nudges below 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: scarf dissolving into architecture while Elias becomes "a fold in the story." Accumulative lens holds through density shift from dust motes to reawakened silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scarffunctions as micro-setting that charges closure: "threads weaving into grout... gaps where meaning hid" transforms environment into active constraint. Scientific library details (hyperbolic tessellations) directly enable the reawakening ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: shifting from passive fragment-collecting to reading "spaces between" pages redefines options. Scarf dissolution provides undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("lines curved forever toward where stories lived") reweights the central question without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete action: scarf dissolving becomes "the library remembered its shape," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in phrases like "dust motes in slanted light" and "tea that tasted faintly of chalk." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure: short clauses during scarf unfolding ("He anchored... Then he began") versus lyrical closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; every line multiplies purpose: "scarf dissolved into carpet... weaving into grout... grain of wood... gaps where meaning hid" compresses setting, action, and theme without muddle. Final line’s cadence ("Somewhere, his mother was laughing") epitomizes propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry transforms memory trope into visceral ritual. Emotional specificity ("sanely eccentric," chalk-tasting tea) avoids abstraction. Transformation test passed: swapping library for generic setting would break causal logic of tessellations enabling reawakening.</comment>
