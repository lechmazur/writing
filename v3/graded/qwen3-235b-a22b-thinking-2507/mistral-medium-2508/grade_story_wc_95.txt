<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: Elias’s precision vs impatience, Liora’s calculation masking eagerness. Flaws drive choices—her 12-year-old code risks partnership, his "waits" philosophy clashes with action. Final renunciation of Council’s verdict earns cost via visible micro-choices like tracing light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: key reveal reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("Council could keep their verdict"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds through pattern recognition (shadows/light), culminating in undeniable cost at "both unbroken." Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices: glass refracts light Elias traces; brook’s "waits" metaphor charges closure. Final image ("glass walls reflecting silhouettes") reweights environment as active constraint. Micro-setting (mechanical arm) shapes tactics via sparks during clash.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Council’s verdict) tightens via pattern-decoding escalation. Elias tracing light refraction—not attacking—narrows options, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: abandoning institutional validation for partnership, charged by "Lock’s been broken for decades."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "fence with shadows" metaphor, not moralizing. Final image ("city sprawled like unfinished argument") reweights brook’s patience as active partnership, avoiding false equivalence. No thematic echo—Liora’s "doubt into a map" is character-specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV anchored in Elias’s precision-engineer lens ("gears whispering," "angles she measured"). Dialogue distinction flawless: Liora’s "blade unsheathed" laugh vs. Elias’ brook metaphors. Stress compresses diction ("sparks flying") without voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("patience curdled into something fiercer"). "Sparks flying" slightly generic but not in peak beat. Final line’s rhythm ("make it *worth* the wait") charges closure. No figurative muddle in decisive beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mechanical arm duelist transforms "philosopher" trope via embodied precision. "Diplomatically fierce" manifests in Liora’s rapier diplomacy, not labels. Risk-taking (fencing as negotiation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
