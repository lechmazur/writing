<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rook's embodied contradiction—sniffing dead echoes while seeking life—drives choices; micro-choices like flexing claws at the cylinder's voice reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost ("rules—no digging too deep"). Final endurance as Earned Stasis forecloses survival path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "the world outside was a scar / inside was a promise" crystallizes the wound-bridge motif. Accumulative lens holds; the leaf's melting wax pulse reweights distance with visceral stakes. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The wax-leaf constrains choice (burns pocket, softens on glass) and charges the final image ("veins pulsing against his skin like a second heartbeat"). Sensory hierarchy—sniffing damp earth beneath rust—mirrors Rook's bloodhound POV without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: "distance is a wound" evolves from abstract riddle to physical cost (melted wax, scar/promise dichotomy). Pressure coheres via environmental clues (wind bending rocks), but fissure discovery lacks causal agency—coincidence complicates, doesn't escalate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the leaf's transformation: "some things don't rot" becomes "first garden war" without moralizing. Final image ("vines tightened") offers non-literal answer to distance/closeness, avoiding thematic echo despite cylinder's direct line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "muzzle gray with years of sniffing out the dead" filters world through bloodhound senses. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during dome entry ("bones were hers")—with no head-hopping. Lyric compression taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No closure artifacts, but paraphrase loop in wind descriptions ("wind carved spirals," "wind howled," "wind carried") dulls mid-scene momentum. High density otherwise: "ribs of twisted metal groaning" does triple duty for setting, metaphor, and tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via bloodhound POV and wax-leaf science. "First garden war" reframing feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (non-human protagonist, lyric closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"vines pulled him not toward death" subverts grave tropes.</comment>
