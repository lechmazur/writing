<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in carpentry; silence as embodied contradiction. Final choice earned through tactile micro-choices (e.g., closing fingers around fragment), but "whispering back" reflection slightly over-articulates cost without visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: silence reconfigured as offering with felt cost ("no sound came out" preceding the shift). "Train doesn’t forget" motif teaches pattern early; cost proof clear in the transformation of silence’s meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Carousel horse’s hollow flank (tool-as-setting) constrains discovery of fragment and charges final image ("wooden eye gleamed... whispering back"). Sensory specificity ("sawdust and rust melody") avoids symbolism by shaping Lior’s nonverbal song.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (silence as barrier vs. possibility) deepen through Lior’s agency: following song, shaping air. Cost legible in the vocal failure preceding the offering, but "wrong turn" escalation relies on accumulative pattern rather than causal pressure, slightly diluting escalation under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: silence as "door" built "one piece at a time" reweights the carpenter’s entire existence without moralizing. Final image (wind chime as invitation) offers non-literal answer to "interpret silence" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in carpentry-tuned details ("warped wood," "sawdust melody"); rhythm modulates from sparse ("Lior worked in silence") to textured during song. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally at "Lior opened his mouth."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "misting hush" metaphor sustains without muddle. Slight overwriting in "captured sunlight" (carousel horse) risks density, but "sawdust and rust melody" redeems with concrete propulsion. Final line’s "began" avoids closure blurring.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms silent protagonist trope through carpentry-as-voice; "halo fragment" recontextualizes silence as active creation. Emotional truth in Lior’s wordless song feels inevitable: specific tools (sawdust) ground the fantastical, avoiding safety-middle hedging.</comment>
