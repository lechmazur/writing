<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in scar-as-roads-or-warnings hesitation; embodied emotion peaks when ink bleeds through dome crack. Final renunciation earned through micro-choices like resetting timer to zero.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: torn confetti becoming "just light" crystallizes release. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—storm’s breaking directly reweights observatory’s stillness after vigil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Observatory constrains choice (nowhere to flee storm) and charges final image: "page was blank" echoes dome’s glass. Timer’s backward count evolves from relic to reset symbol, making tools active participants in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (releasing the poem) tightens through storm’s pressure; timer chiming forces decisive action. Cost is unmistakable in "dust of old poems" as weight lifts—not through speech but surrender to weather.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("I am the cartographer / page blank") reweights scars as self-authored without moralizing. Theme emerges from ink bleeding into rain, not statements—avoids thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "veins illuminating glass dome" filters storm through photographer’s eye. Rhythmic control peaks in "confetti, until words were just shapes, just light"—compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor metaphor overlap ("veins" lightning then "lashed" glass) in high-pressure beat. Otherwise masterful density: "timer chimed—three short bursts, like a code" does triple duty advancing time, sound, and meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censored poet/photographer trope through "rarefy pain into something pure." Bold structural choice: destruction as release transforms expected catharsis without gimmickry.</comment>
