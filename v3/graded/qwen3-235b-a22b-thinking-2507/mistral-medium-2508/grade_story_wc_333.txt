<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Locksmith’s embodied contradiction (rule vs. empathy) drives the pivotal choice; her micro-decisions (listening to hair’s space) reveal values under pressure. Man in moth-coat lacks depth but serves as functional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "greatest secrets weren’t hidden behind locks" reweights premise through the map’s revelation. Star’s "hint" borders on coincidence but earns payoff via memory integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Meteorite pick and locket function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges closure; "bruised twilight" ribbon anchors sensory specificity. Cosmic shift slightly unmoors alley grounding but serves thematic charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing an idea vs. locksmith’s rule) tightens through her agency—pressing the thumb forecloses her rigid principle with visible cost. Man’s demand ("free her") lacks sufficient development to deepen secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hair/map transformation: "lock was never meant to keep me in, but to keep the world out" avoids moralizing. Final line reweights premise with earned ambiguity—no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers knew the weight," "hummed like a held breath") modulates under pressure. Lyrical compression ("shop tilting like a ship") taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "ribbon the color of bruised twilight" exemplifies textural density. Minor paraphrase loop ("walls dissolved... air thick") in cosmic shift deducts 0.1—no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "magical locksmith" trope via hair-as-map and reframing locks as protection. Emotional specificity ("girl braiding fears into hair") synthesizes universal stakes through concrete, irreplaceable details.</comment>
