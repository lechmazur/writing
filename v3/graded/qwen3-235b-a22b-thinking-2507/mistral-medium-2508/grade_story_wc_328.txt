<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’ bitterness-turned-laughter choice; embodied emotion avoids cliché ("bitterness had become his religion"). Herbalist’s pressure remains underdeveloped despite pivotal warnings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’ metamorphosis choice reconfigures stakes with visceral cost ("garden swallowed him whole"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation, though phone’s late agency slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Garden setting constrains every choice—from arrowhead discovery to vines coiling ankles—and charges the final image. Thyme-buried phone exemplifies micro-setting as active pressure point, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via arrowhead’s metamorphosis into seed, forcing Elias’ cosmic-joke choice. Cost is legible ("stay and rot or let the joke rewrite him"), but phone’s coincidental ring slightly undermines agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "harmony untamed" reweighted by Elias’ laughter-as-transformation. Avoids moralizing; final image ("frostbitten and hopeful") offers resonant answer without stating moral. Herbalist’s "lessons for becoming" skirts thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gravitationally playful" lexicon mirrors Elias’ researcher lens. Rhythmic control peaks during phone call ("static clinging to their skin"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("gravitationally playful" ×3) in mid-beats; "static" overuse risks thematic echo. Otherwise, high density ("vines warm as lover’s fingers") and clean propulsion. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: cosmic horror meets folk remedy through "harmony untamed" lens. Risk-taking (laughter as resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Arrowhead’s evolution feels inevitable, transforming trope into organic metaphor.</comment>
