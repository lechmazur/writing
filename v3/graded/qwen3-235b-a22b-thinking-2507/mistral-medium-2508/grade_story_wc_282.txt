<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via heat-map spikes (fear/violet) against curiosity/gold, culminating in the fossil's searing "recognition" that compels Lior's voice. Slight deduction for "rebellion" stated overtly rather than fully embodied earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: fossil vanishes but "the map was just beginning," with rain-as-promise crystallizing cost (loss of relic) and reconfigured stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through lichen pulses and heat-map symphony tightening pressure toward resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: narrowing cave triggers fear (Q1), calcite crystals alter Lior's gait, and the fossil's embedded-aliveness directly charges the final image as "message." Micro-setting (wrist display) dictates emotional navigation under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (voice for the world vs. stasis ban) tightens through Lior's agency: deeper cave entry, palm-press on fossil, and decisive speech. Cost is visceral—the fossil's disappearance—though escalation relies slightly on environmental response over character adaptation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through fossil's transformation from relic to message carrier; final raindrops as "weight of a promise" reweights "transitional objects" without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo despite explicit "voice of the unknown" phrasing through earned sensory payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: heat-mapping emotions refracts world through Lior's tech-augmented senses. Minor deduction for "factually mystical" leaning toward thematic label rather than organic thought during high-pressure cave descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "crimson—a heat signature not of emotion, but of memory" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in "symphony of anxiety and awe" risks diluting peak tension but remains voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "sensory map maker" reframes post-apocalyptic tropes through embodied tech-poetics. "Factually mystical" and fossil-as-message transform familiarity, though hibernation framework leans slightly generic without deeper rule exploration.</comment>
