<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("not to master but to dub") and embodied emotion ("restlessness... thrill of the next note") drive micro-choices under pressure; flawlessly avoids therapy-speak while showing simultaneous fear/thrill during sea's voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (fear transforming to thrill) under Accumulative/Textural lens; blue hour's fleeting nature constrains tactics, making the final mallet raise feel earned with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Driftwood orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (tilting motion guiding strikes) and charges the final image; salt-stiffened mallet and indigo sky details filter through Leeward's sensory priorities with zero tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (striking different objects) deepens the dominant stake (turning obstacles into instruments); sea's voice forces crystallization of stance, but the cost—while felt—isn't viscerally physical enough for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("dub it... turn resistance into rhythm"), not abstraction; final image reweights "restlessness" as creative thrill without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in cloud-as-sheet-music metaphor; rhythmic control under pressure ("thrumming energy... thrum of euphony") with purposeful compression taught early; zero head-hopping despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt-stiffened cloth" and "bruise-like sound" demonstrate textural specificity without muddle; minor deduction for "thrumming energy" slightly overlapping "restless energy" in proximity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "storm prophet" trope through specific "dubbing" mechanics and floating orchard; risk-taking (sea as collaborator) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional truth in Leeward's flawed, restless drive.</comment>
