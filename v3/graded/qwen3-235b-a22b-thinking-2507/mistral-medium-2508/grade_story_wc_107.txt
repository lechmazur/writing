<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene: Elara's calloused hands (past abandonment) vs. "satchel heavy with tools she wouldn't need" (present renunciation). Final choice to flood the room earns endurance with visible cost—"abandoned this room again" made concrete by leaving the bookmark pointing toward the door.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "The thaw would come for this too, eventually" crystallizes stakes while "hands pressed into the earth as if taking a vow" reweights the dominant lens (Accumulative/Textural). Valve turn narrows options, and the meltwater's memory charge makes conceptual cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice and charges closure: Glassblowing tools (satchel, orbs) evolve from "vessels meant to hold questions" to the final shard held "to the light." The control room's pipes/valves directly enable the flood decision, and the glacier's retreat reveals the blueprint that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: Thaw pressure intensifies through Elara's discovery of the second bookmark ("controlled collapse"), forcing the valve decision. Cost is unmistakable—"satchel heavy with tools she wouldn't need" shows forfeiture of past identity as she follows an "unrecognized" path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image reweights theme without moralizing: "sun fracture into questions" transforms "safe zone" from her father's physical blueprint to active fragility. Avoids thematic echo by grounding insight in glass shards rather than abstraction, with "build something fragile enough to matter" crystallizing earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines under pressure: Glassblower's tactile focus ("calloused hands," "shard to light") persists through high-stakes beats. Rhythmic control evident in valve-turn sequence—"Water hissed... ice gave way"—with zero head-hopping. Final line variation ("She began to blow") pays off early voice patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning. "Bookmark's crack was not a wound, but a record" demonstrates high density without muddle. Closure beat avoids figurative clutter: "meltwater would remember" charges action through concrete rhythm, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific craft: "Safe zone" redefined via glassblowing philosophy ("flaws becoming part of their strength") avoids abstraction. Fresh inflection in "thaw as crucible" synthesizes environmental pressure with emotional truth, resisting safety-middle through deliberate fragility.</comment>
