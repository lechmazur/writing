<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "excruiatingly gentle" hands tracing frozen gears while confronting abandonment, but fracture moment lacks micro-choice escalation—the shift to breaking crystal feels passive rather than earned through visible internal tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: elders see "ruin" while scribe hears "dream released," crystallizing the conceptual repricing where silence becomes dialogue; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density shift at fracture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt actively constrains choices—it fractures under his palm, mirrors his face, and charges the final image; "petrichor" evolves from nostalgia trigger to "threads of light" weaving the chimes, perfectly embodying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (making peace with abandoned dream) tighten through his physical interaction with the forecourt, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the crack "split beneath his fingers" rather than arising from a clear choice, weakening pressure buildup to the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final line "the orrery tick-tick-ticked, and the world answered" reweights time as dialogue without moralizing; "imperfect, asymmetrical, alive" orrery crystallizes the theme through concrete action, avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "quill suspended like a bird too afraid to land" and rhythm control during fracture ("tick-tick-ticked"), but "petrichor nostalgia" slightly elevates diction beyond scribe’s plausible lexicon in peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "he didn’t measure the silence. He let it measure him" uses inversion for thematic weight without scaffold; minor repetition of "hidden sunrise" avoids loop penalty through reweighted meaning in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms artist’s-block trope via tactile specificity (moonstone pendulum, "gears etched with constellations no one else had dared to name"); "imperfect, asymmetrical, alive" orrery synthesizes emotional truth with fresh conceptual risk.</comment>
