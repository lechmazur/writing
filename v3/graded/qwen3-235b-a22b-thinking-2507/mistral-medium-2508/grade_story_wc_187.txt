<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sculpting identity" vs. "stop trying to shape it") drives the earned renunciation; embodied emotion in "fingers brushed something colder than stone" avoids therapy-speak. Vision risk: the laughing-self epiphany borders on convenient but is anchored by physicality of shadow-twitch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "page was blank... that was enough" reconfigures identity from dammed vault to flowing river. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the shadow’s "twitch" and flags’ "chime" tighten pressure without causal turns. Cost legible in abandoned method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal flags function as micro-setting that charges closure: evolve from "humming" to "chiming in recognition," constraining her choice to stop measuring. Storm progression ("pulse" → "lullaby") mirrors internal shift. Environment shapes tactics via rain-refraction timing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpting identity from memory) tightens through Accumulative pressure: shadow’s "twitch" and colder memory deepen knowledge. Cost is visceral in abandoning conjecture for listening. Agency is pure internal shift—no external antagonist needed for this lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "river" metaphor reweights memory without moralizing. Final line ("sound of the past making room") offers resonant non-literal answer to "hush" question. Avoids all thematic echo traps via sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in memory textures ("laughter of a market long dissolved"). Rhythm modulates under pressure: short clauses during epiphany ("Identity wasn’t something..."). Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored to archivist’s lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops except minor cadence repetition ("not... but") in vision sequence. Final image ("inkwell full... blank page") achieves crystalline clarity. Strategic density: "fog outside softened, no longer solid but shifting, alive" compresses transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "archivist" trope via physical memory (crystal flags, shadow stains). "Preemptive nostalgia" concept feels fresh through specific actions. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes—no gimmickry. "River" metaphor avoids abstraction via felt cost.</comment>
