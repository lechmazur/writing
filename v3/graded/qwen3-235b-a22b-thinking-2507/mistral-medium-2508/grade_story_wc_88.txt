<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: hollow ribs vs. clinic promise, frayed baseball as moral tether. Final pawn move reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost ("I’m here to start"). No therapy-speak; emotions layer realistically in the alley reflection scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: the park chess scene crystallizes Liam’s stance shift ("start" vs. "finish it"). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density (bioluminescent veins, ozone scent) tightens empathy’s meaning. Cost proof: "air tasted different. Like possibility" reweights his entire journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its warmth and reflective surface constrain Liam’s choice ("drop or throw"), while the baseball’s "delicately robust" leather resists tunnel dampness. Final image of it rolling in grass recharges prior meaning with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (empathy as gift vs. burden) tightens through Liam’s agency: throwing the ball forces the lake’s path to emerge. Cost is legible in the newspaper burning against his thigh and the tunnel’s collapse "like a held breath released"—a visceral trade-off for his new stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "Empathy isn’t something you get, it’s something you give" gains weight via the lake’s reading of his reflection. Final image rejects moralizing—chessboard as "minefield of choices" offers non-literal answer to the central question without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: clinic’s "hollow behind ribs," tunnel air swallowing flashlight beams. Rhythmic control under pressure ("He reared back and hurled it") avoids syntactic monotony. No head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical detachment to tactile urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("leather delicately robust, resisting the damp") propels momentum. Final line’s "untouched by time" avoids cliché through concrete action (baseball rolling in grass). Figurative language ("comet tail of disrupted light") serves pressure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through specific moral calculus: Morrow’s "labyrinth" reframes choice as hinge, not destiny. Jaded wonder tone ("neon, same stink of rain") avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lake’s sternum voice) heightens stakes without gimmickry—closure hinges on tactile specificity.</comment>
