<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elias turns the valve "not as proof but as anchor," revealing simultaneous skepticism and desperate need. Micro-choices like pocketing bolts establish scavenger identity, but father’s backstory summary slightly dilutes embodied causality for the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Elias sitting with the valve "lighter now" crystallizes the cost of carrying truth after Luz’s revelation. Lens holds—Accumulative/Textural density (static, water ripples) reweights the stake without causal gaps. Cost proof: "lighter now, as if it had exhaled its secret" makes conceptual weight legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The valve wheel functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its beads "cool and smooth as rosary stones" transform from tool to sacred burden. Sensory hierarchy excels—Elias hears loom clicks *through* metal, proving setting constrains perception and choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: turning the valve narrows options to endurance. Cost is conceptual (truth as burden), but lacks tangible price paid *on page* beyond the wheel’s weight shift. Dominant stake (inherited trauma) deepens via Luz’s thread-swallowed throat, though physical cost remains oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the valve’s transformation: "truths weren’t meant to be swallowed whole. Some were meant to be carried" avoids moralizing by grounding wisdom in the wheel’s physicality. Final image reweights the opening scavenger motif without abstraction, but "burnt sugar" scent risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elias notices "beads like a molared jaw" through scavenger’s tactile lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly—staccato "click-click-click" accelerates panic, then dissolves into the hush where "rosary stones" resonate. Zero head-hopping; psychic radio’s "wet giggle" stays within his fractured POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances momentum. "Drowsy, alert second" compresses time under stress without syntactic clutter. Figurative language ("tunnel exhaled damp like a sleeping beast") charges closure without muddle—valve beads as "rosary stones" crystallizes theme in the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality lies in transforming "ghost shift" into embodied trauma: Luz’s thread-swallowed throat reconfigures factory lore into visceral metaphor. Risk-taking (radio as psychic conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but "burnt sugar" scent edges toward familiar decay tropes.</comment>
