<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied grief ("fingers trembled," "grief was a stubborn thing") and micro-choices like polishing the gem against her sleeve. Final renunciation—becoming part of the recording—feels earned through years of folding sorrow. Minor abstraction in "dream-stuff beneath" slightly dilutes the visceral transformation moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the isle wasn’t sinking. It was unfolding" reconfigures reality with undeniable cost (her dissolution into light). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory density ("walls sighed," cranes taking flight)—and the shadow detachment’s ambiguity serves the thematic payoff. Orientation is anchored by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The smoky quartz gem constrains the climax—its "pull" and "bite" directly charge the final image where cranes carry "every dream she’d ever caught." Micro-setting mastery: the tea garden’s origami cranes evolve from brittle graveyard to luminous vessels, transforming grief into motion. "Brittle with salt and grief" exemplifies selective, purpose-driven detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: preserving her daughter’s voice versus surrendering to the dream-recording. Escalation is driven by her agency—pressing the gem, reaching into the pane—with visceral cost (pain "rewriting" her skin). The "unfolding" revelation deepens stakes under the accumulative lens, though the shadow’s origin lacks subtle foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as unfolding, not carrying, crystallized when cranes "spiraled upward, weaving through the basilica’s spires." The final image—"petals of steam and shadow" blooming beneath her—resonates without moralizing. No thematic echo; complexity lingers in her daughter’s voice becoming "a hand pulling her deeper."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "steam curled like unspoken promises," "grief was a stubborn thing." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure ("A breath. Then the walls sighed"). Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing in the climax, but the voice remains consistently haunted and precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each line advances atmosphere or character ("facets catching the dying light like a breath held too long"). Final line—"rising... into the place where dreams are kept"—crystallizes closure with poetic propulsion. One near-overwrite ("luminous and white-hot, the kind that didn’t just hurt but rewrote") is redeemed by visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific mechanics: dream-recording via lanterns, origami from love letters. The "unfolding" revelation feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesized through the isle’s physical logic. Risk-taking (lyric compression, dream-substance cranes) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—culminating in the luminous, earned ascent.</comment>
