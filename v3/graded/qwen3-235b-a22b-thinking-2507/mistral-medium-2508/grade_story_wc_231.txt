<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("eccentric by necessity") and embodied emotion (trembling hands during steeping) drive the final renunciation; micro-choice of returning the boutonnière to his lapel crystallizes values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "the memory—soft, persistent, and finally free—would find its way home" reconfigures the borrowed memories premise while the crumbling boutonnière embodies the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The boutonnière (tool/object) constrains choice by forcing Elias to steep it, then charges the final image as "warm against his chest" before crumbling; dock’s "vein of forgotten bone" mirrors the memory-transfer theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulation of sensory gaps (lavender nets, gouged piling) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, but lacks a decisive narrowing of options; cost is legible in the relinquishment of memory yet escalation feels observational rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "borrowed goodbyes" and the boutonnière’s crumbling reweight memory as transient vessel rather than possession, avoiding moralizing while resonating through the final image’s release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("noticed gaps," "tide hesitated") and rhythmic control under pressure ("soft but persistent, like the pulse of the beacon") with purposeful elision taught early (stranger’s vanishing) paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("jars of preserved storms") propels momentum without muddle, though "preserved storms" risks overwriting yet earns payoff in the final "borrowed goodbyes" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "borrowed memories" trope through specific lighthouse-keeper logic; the opal dock’s "vein of forgotten bone" reprise feels inevitable, with risk-taking (lyric compression) heightening stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
