<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hunger" vs theft) drives closure choice; embodied emotion in "chest tightened" avoids therapy-speak; pilgrim's secondary pressure crystallizes Lena's endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: chip insertion creates "space between them" with conceptual cost (surrendered possession); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shift to "constellation no one had seen"; orientation anchored in 42 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dome oculus and drone constrain choices (low flight path, light alignment); "brilliant dimness" micro-setting charges final image; sensory hierarchy (visual distortion, servo whir) reflects Lena's urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lena's agency: chip theft narrows options to shared revelation; pilgrim's trembling hands show visceral cost; escalation culminates in "space between them" reweighting belonging as relational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "missing pieces" motif reweighted by final constellation—no moralizing; "frequency wasn't a sound. It was a shape" offers non-literal answer to loneliness with conceptual cost of surrendered ownership.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("faintest tremor in the air") filters all detail; rhythmic control under pressure ("servos whirring like a held breath"); no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "indigo bruise of the sky" avoids purple prose; information density peaks at closure ("constellation remained, etched in space between shadows"); sentence rhythm accelerates during drone ascent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone tech and ancient observatory avoids genre clichés; "brilliant dimness" transforms "loneliness" trope into embodied light physics; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry (e.g., chip as non-linguistic key).</comment>
