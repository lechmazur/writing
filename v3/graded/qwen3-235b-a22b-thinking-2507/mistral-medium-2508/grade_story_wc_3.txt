<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (grief vs curiosity) act simultaneously; final choice to "reestablish" rather than "undo" earns closure with visible cost through tactile micro-choices like pressing the seed into wood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("knew this was not undoing... held in light that let him see both loss and love"), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density builds to the tilt moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky Arbor's magnetic pull constrains tool use and enables the transition; final image of its swaying branch charges the closure by mirroring Elias's reconfigured perspective on loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's climb (agency narrowing options to "reestablishing"), with cost legible in his realization that this isn't undoing but holding "both at once" like translucent text.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("physics of leaving," "word on translucent leaf"), with final image rejecting moralizing by showing how "light had changed" without stating a lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in character-specific details ("sap glowed faintly, as if embarrassed"); rhythm modulates perfectly during transition with abrupt short sentences ("Nothing happened. Then the wind reversed.")</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere or stakes. "Static between his thoughts" shows rather than tells grief, avoiding therapy-speak while maintaining lyrical precision under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted by spirit" trope by revealing it as grief's hypothesis; specific details (magnetic boughs, obsidian seed) synthesize universal loss with fresh physics-of-transition framing that feels inevitable.</comment>
