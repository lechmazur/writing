<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lior’s guilt vs. scholarly detachment, embodied through micro-choices like grabbing the sundial. However, the Hesperornis functions more as symbol than character with independent agency, limiting relationship dynamics despite the arm-perching moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "We’re not ghosts... the ones who refused to stay dead" reweights the premise with visceral cost ("etched into his ribs"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly, with the sundial’s evolving reflections tightening pressure toward the feather sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The brass sundial constrains every pivotal choice—from Lior’s shield gesture to the reflection-triggered shockwave—and charges the final image as the library doors open. Its atomically reflective trait and the tidal library’s shifting shelves actively reshape tactics, not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Lior’s agency: his whispered question ("How do you coexist...?") escalates into the book-grabbing climax. The cost—dissolving book, feather sacrifice—is unmistakable, but the stone circle’s hum lacks active constraint beyond atmospheric pressure, slightly muting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the mirror-book’s transformation: isolation’s "weight" becomes independence via embodied action, not abstraction. Avoids moralizing by rooting insight in the feather’s sacrifice ("stop asking for forgiveness"), though "brittle awakening" repetition risks thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bones groaning like old ship timber," "static" spines) modulates under stress with rhythmic control. The lyrical compression ("a Morse code of extinction") is taught early and pays off in the closure’s "rain and possibility," though "brittle awakening" duplication slightly dilutes voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wet feathers and gunpowder" exemplifies textural specificity. "Brittle awakening" appears twice but earns integration through contextual transformation (pain → acceptance). Near-flawless propulsion, though the second "brittle awakening" risks paraphrase in the high-pressure climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms extinction guilt into tangible library mechanics: the tidal shelves and atomically reflective sundial reframe memory as physical space. The mirror-book’s CR closure feels inevitable yet revelatory, with risk-taking (lyric compression) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
