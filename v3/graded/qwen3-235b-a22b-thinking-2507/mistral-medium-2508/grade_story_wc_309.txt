<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlin’s contradictory impulses (exile vs. belief in his candle) act simultaneously in the garden folly beat; his final renunciation of institutional mastery is earned through the keystone’s revelation of "meanings" in imperfection, with visible cost in walking away from praise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Marlin’s refusal to explain ("Some things aren’t for explaining") crystallizes the stakes under an Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the dominant conflict through the merged candle-keystone light’s "imperfect, flickering, alive" charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice spire’s micro-setting actively constrains choice (numb fingers, stiff robes during climb) and charges the final image—keystone light revealing "veins of gold in the ice," making environment indispensable to the closure’s reconfiguration of sacredness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marlin’s agency under the Accumulative lens: the keystone’s touch forces stance crystallization ("The sacred in the simple"), with conceptual cost legible in his rejection of the deans’ validation, though the automated hymn’s role in deepening pressure could resonate more acutely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the merged candle-keystone light’s "imperfect, flickering, alive" shadows—a resonant answer to "sacred in the simple" that avoids moralizing, using concrete particulars (cracked teacup, scrawled margin) to reweight the premise without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frostbloom," "humming with stubborn glow") modulates rhythm from clipped climb sentences to lyrical garden observations; dialogue subtext ("You’re late") carries tension without head-hopping, sustaining Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wind howling like a choir of disapproving mentors" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "The fire roared in answer" achieves crystalline rhythm without figurative muddle, elevating pressure through concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms fantasy tropes via specific stakes: the "unremarkable" mage’s candle becomes a fresh inflection on sacred imperfection, with emotional truth anchored in automated hymns’ "hollow as a polished stone" versus roaring flame—a non-obvious synthesis avoiding abstraction.</comment>
