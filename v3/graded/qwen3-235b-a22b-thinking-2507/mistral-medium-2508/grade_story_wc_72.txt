<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liora's underdeveloped physicality in peak beats weakens embodied emotion despite strong human characterization; micro-choices like fumbling ampoule reveal value hierarchies with visible cost but "incisively kind" trait lacks contradictory impulses during pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (dome split/kelp-light spill) reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (human's helmet removal); orientation anchors by line 3; structural weakness setup pays off perfectly despite slight abruptness in child's song arrival under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Garden's coral plaques and mosaic directly constrain choices (glove on six-armed tile triggers memory), while ampoule's stain bleeding into grooves charges final image; minor deduction for underutilized tactile interaction with environment during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Revelations tighten stakes by foreclosing options (ampoule slip → helmet removal) under Accumulative lens; human's agency in pressing seam forces trade-off with visceral cost (ragged breaths/knees on sand); pressure coheres without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Final image (city rising through surface) answers "gods as drowned stories" without moralizing; ampoule repurposed as pigment earns theme through concrete action; subtext operates via mosaic's six arms and structural weakness metaphor flawlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Human POV perceptual signature shines ("thoughts coiled around ampoule like a secret too sharp"); telepathy as "pressure ripple" avoids filter verbs; minor deduction for "incisively kind" abstraction in high-stress beat despite chisel metaphor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gloved fingers brushing coral plaques as if reading dead city’s pulse" exemplifies triple-duty prose; final line "began to rise" recharges opening with crystalline resonance; ampoule "bruise" metaphor justified by payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Underwater city as womb (not weapon) transforms tropes; structural weakness as physical/metaphorical seam synthesizes organically; risk-taking (telepathy as pressure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
