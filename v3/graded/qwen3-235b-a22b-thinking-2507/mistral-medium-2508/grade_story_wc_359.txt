<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "silence was just another kind of cage" versus elders' command, but micro-choices lack layered irrationality; "I didn’t care" oversimplifies emotional stakes during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "the aurora did not flicker. It stayed" crystallizes reconfiguration, while the crumbling sheet and elders' anticipated heresy prove conceptual cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (thawing ground under bare feet) and charges the final image; sensory specificity ("warm as living things") avoids white-room syndrome while mirroring internal liberation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency ("struck the first chime—not to constrain, but to unfetter"), with visible cost in the sheet's destruction and elders' heresy charge; one tightening (silence→breath) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "sculpted hush" transforms from enforced silence to "world that had remembered how to wonder," avoiding moralizing while the final chime's "promise woven into the air" reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("listened with her skin") and rhythmic control under pressure ("ribbons of violet and gold" to "fractals of emerald and cobalt") create distinct voice; only slight register drift in "certify wonder as essential" disrupts POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture ("ice groaned, not in protest but in relief"). Minor deduction for "warm as living things" bordering cliché in high-pressure beat, but no figurative muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "aurora taming" trope through synesthetic bell-ringing; "amber sheet crumbled into dust" as indispensable catalyst creates fresh inflection where premise follows implications without retreat.</comment>
