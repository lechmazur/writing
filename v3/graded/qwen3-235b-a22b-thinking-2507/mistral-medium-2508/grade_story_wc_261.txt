<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "let the scar ache without trying to decode it"—embodied shift from seeker to bearer. Micro-choice of writing on the file earns closure with visible cost. Slight deduction: emotional progression leans sequential rather than simultaneous contradiction under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "It did not save her. It only remembered" reweights wounds with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—plant whispers and tunneling imagery crystallize into her stance. Sand running during her exhale makes cost visceral and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hourglass (tool) and scar (body) charge the final image—sand hissing as she writes reconfigures time. Tower setting pressures choices via "stone tunneling," but its role is slightly less active than micro-settings. Cap at 8.8 since body/tool constrain choice and charge closure, yet tower could deepen tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake ("displaced miracles") tightens through plant revelations to her writing act—a renunciation with felt cost. Agency drives escalation: fern’s whisper forces her to confront mother’s scar. Cost proof test passed: "let the scar ache" crystallizes the price of relinquishing meaning-making.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar/coffee ring motifs evolving from "concentric confessions" to "shape of her love"—no moralizing. Final line’s "carried" reweights wounds as vessels of memory, not puzzles. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in dandelion pollen and collarbone ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "tracing stories in scars" reflects her wound-obsession. Rhythm modulates under stress ("She was the thing in the walls") without losing lyrical control. One elevated phrase ("concentric confessions") slightly jars but redeemed by contextual urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sand hissed onto the sill" exemplifies propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure: ivy "humming like a tuning fork" concretizes her telepathy. Final line’s "Dawn held its breath" avoids cliché through earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "healing journey" trope via plant telepathy and scars-as-wounds-not-closure. "Displaced miracle" concept feels inevitable yet fresh, grounded in dandelion pollen and liver scars. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
