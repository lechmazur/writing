<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s shift from hunter to seeker is earned through embodied contradiction (“serene anger that carved rivers through stone”) and the visceral cost of his prior ink use (white hair, alien veins). Albino trait remains ornamental, failing to constrain choices or deepen perception beyond description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: “time didn’t slow... it fractured” reweights the premise with undeniable cost (dissolving patterns, stopped clocks). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through ink patterns and suspended moments, culminating in Kael’s choice to pursue understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The encampment’s “graveyard of pauses” (frozen cup, rippling hair) concretely charges the final image, but terrain doesn’t actively constrain tactics. Wind-carved earth and suspended dust embody time distortion, yet micro-setting lacks tangible pressure on Kael’s choices beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael’s cognitive deepening—realizing the thief “was hunting too” transforms the dominant conflict from vengeance to shared pursuit. Cost is palpable (risking permanent disappearance), but physical confrontation lacks escalation; tension hinges solely on the conceptual turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: the spiral symbol’s fading reweights time as fractured fragments, not stolen moments. No moralizing—Kael’s shift to understanding (“to understand, not to kill”) earns resonance through the ink mechanics, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“milky eyes burned,” breath “curling like smoke”) modulates under pressure, with rhythmic control (“Kael didn’t run. He walked”). Drone’s “syrupy” voice risks purple prose but mirrors time distortion; albino POV could deepen sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via dense imagery (“swirls of black that dissolved before they could settle”). Minor slip: “veins threaded with something that wasn’t blood” feels clinical in an otherwise visceral beat, slightly dulling closure’s immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Time-as-fragments premise transforms time-theft tropes through the ink threshold mechanic. Emotional truth in Kael’s shift from vengeance to curiosity (“to understand”) elevates beyond surface novelty; risk-taking (quiet ending, conceptual focus) heightens stakes cohesively.</comment>
