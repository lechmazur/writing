<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("learning language of absence") and embodied emotion ("edges softened") powerfully shown; final renunciation earned through ritual, though flaw compounding could deepen micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with undeniable cost ("stopping was a kind of death"); Accumulative lens holds through "crystallized time" deepening, though cost could feel more visceral than conceptual in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight functions as essential micro-setting, charging closure when rain "painted stripes" on the kept lion; tool (ash blank) constrains every choice while avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through widow's agency when she keeps the carving, reweighting "contain" with visible cost; escalation driven by crystallized time deepening, though one pivotal turn suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Here and gone" concept reweights closure without moralizing; final image offers non-literal answer to loss through "rust-hued peace," avoiding thematic echo despite girl's question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("light fractured like old glass") and rhythmic control under pressure flawless; minor lexicon drift in "hauntingly practical" barely dents otherwise immaculate voice calibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "steam curling into shape of things" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One near-redundancy ("calloused palms"/"hands ached") prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through seamstress-turned-carver specificity; "hollow promises" coins and ash grain details feel inevitable. Risks quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
