<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("paths choose" vs. "I chose right") drives micro-choices under pressure; embodied cost in seal-to-ash transformation; no therapy-speak during storm's bone-deep thrum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "path stepped back, then forward" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (ash seal, walking-in-circles realization); Accumulative lens holds through density increase to terminal's final message.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker constrains choice (roots blocking floor, murals changing perception); final dissolution into loam/sky charges closure; "ozone/ghost of machine oil" sensory hierarchy reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation via terminal messages ("INTERPRET THE DREAMER" deepening to "TO KNOW... CEASE ASKING") narrows options; storm's thrumming pressure makes cost legible in "bones" before ash seal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "paths don't explain... they hunger" reweights premise with conceptual cost; avoids moralizing via Lior's embodied realization about walking in circles.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ivory so thick metal groaned") filters all details; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure ("stuttered, then showed"); zero head-hopping in single-POV lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "thrumming pressure in her bones" compresses time/emotion; "dissolved into vines, floor into loam" uses strong verbs without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-storms and path-hunger; specific "communion host" wafer transforms portal fantasy tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes via conceptual repricing without gimmickry.</comment>
