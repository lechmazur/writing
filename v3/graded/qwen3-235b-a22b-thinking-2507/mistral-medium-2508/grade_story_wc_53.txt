<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in ghost confrontation ("I’m not here to go back... to make sure she doesn’t follow me"), with embodied cost in the final surrender. Micro-choices (camera as shield, advancing film) reveal hierarchy of values without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "hands—her hands, all of them—reached up to pull her under" reconfigures the lagoon’s meaning under accumulative/textural lens. Lens clarity and cost proof are flawless at the jump.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lagoon functions as essential micro-setting, constraining every choice (reading surface, stepping to edge, jump) and charging the final image. Its evolution from "suspension of memory" to "remembered" forces the climax with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via ghost confrontation narrows Lira’s options to surrender, driven by her agency ("raised the camera wheel like a shield"). The chorus of "You left me behind" imposes visceral cost that forecloses avoidance, tightening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the camera’s empty frame and lagoon’s pull, reweighting "eroded ambitions" as necessary surrender without moralizing. Final image ("it remembered") offers resonant answer to "architect of clouds" through conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "collected fragments... way others gathered shells" and "wind that never ceased," with rhythmic control during the jump ("wind rushed past, carrying ozone"). Ghost dialogue avoids summary through subtext and status shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "suspension of memory and mist" and "weightless" carry layered meaning without muddle. Final image’s "remembered" achieves high density, though "old carnivals" slightly drifts register in peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of regret tropes through specific lagoon mechanics and camera wheel’s evolving role. Risk-taking heightens stakes (ghost chorus as consequence of scavenging) without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
