<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s paradox-smelting work versus his refusal to write the woman into the ledger, though moon-phase embodiment lacks causal tradeoffs in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the creel’s reflection reweights time’s fragility with conceptual cost ("wonder was just routine, seen sideways"), validated by Accumulative lens holding through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal atrium’s tidepools constrain choice (erasing footprints) and charge closure; the creel’s warped slats evolve from description to Elias seeing his molting self within it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the key demands melting "the hour between midnight and dawn," forcing Elias’s crucible choice with felt cost (aching ribs), though moon-phase pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Final image ("spoon’s reflection... quiet insistence that wonder was just routine, seen sideways") reweights the premise without moralizing, using creel’s paradoxes to crystallize theme through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("liquid opals," "shadow stretch long at noon") stays voice-coherent under pressure; constellation coat shifts organically with movement, no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "prismatic shards that pooled like liquid opals" slightly overwrites in high-density opening; no closure artifacts, propulsion remains impeccable through final cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms migration tropes via specific mechanics (milk tooth "still rooted in gum"), though "titan-gear librarian" title leans slightly trope-adjacent despite concrete actions redeeming it.</comment>
