<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine (trembling hands vs steady pigeon work; hiding meteorite while craving connection). Final hum earns endurance with visible cost (rusty voice, ink smudges), though "liar" backstory lacks on-page friction to fully motivate the trust leap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure crystallizes options: humming reconfigures silence as presence with undeniable conceptual cost ("notes were wrong... dust swirled in time"). Accumulative lens holds—dust patterns accumulate pressure toward this stance crystallization without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Attic dust constrains choices (predicting wind for pigeons) and charges the final image. But bookshop setting remains decorative; occupational details don't pressure decisions. Micro-setting (dust) qualifies for 9+ gate, though just narrowly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (trust/silence) tightens through Elias's agency: sending the pigeon with music. Cost is felt in his rusty hum and ink-smudged ledgers. One meaningful deepening suffices, though "paper trails" concept doesn't actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust/meteorite reweighting—"some echoes preserved" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image answers "can trust be trained?" non-literally via humming dust. Slight dissonance from underdramatized "liar" backstory prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels (dust as "crumpled sheet music"; scent as "second skin"). Rhythm varies with pressure (short sentences during tension). Minor register drift in "confessional" metaphor, but elision taught early via dust patterns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "ink the color of dried roses" charges atmosphere. Zero paraphrase loops. "Confessional" metaphor risks abstraction, and "liar" backstory summary slightly dulls closure beat—prevents 9.0 despite high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms pigeon trainer trope through musical lens: dust motes as sheet music, meteorite as "misplaced star." Emotional specificity avoids generic trauma recovery. Derivative elements made particular via bookshop texture and flawed humming.</comment>
