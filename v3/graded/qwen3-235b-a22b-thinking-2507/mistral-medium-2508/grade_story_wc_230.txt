<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (truth-telling instinct vs need for occlusion) act in scene; burial choice earned by sister's suicide with visible cost in "heart quiet." No therapy-speak, embodied emotion through micro-choices like truffle-biting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes truth/safety stakes with felt cost ("heart quiet" after burial). Accumulative lens holds: sensory density tightens pressure toward occlusion. Cost proof solid in final image's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ravine environment actively constrains choices (roots swallow eye, storm destroys truffles) and charges closure ("ravine kept secrets"). Micro-setting (truffle pulp) directly enables occlusion, reweighting meaning at burial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lior's agency: biting truffle softens world then occludes eye, narrowing options to burial. Cost unmistakable in "heart quiet" after rejecting truth's violence, reconfiguring stakes under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("ravine kept its secrets") offers resonant answer to truth/safety question without moralizing. Theme emerges through truffle pulp occlusion and sister's suicide, avoiding thematic echo via concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brittle underbrush," "mist curled at dawn") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("He hadn’t stolen it. That was the problem.") with patterned elision taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; high density in lines like "fruit heavy with damp earth and something older." Final beat "Lior didn’t look back" delivers closure without figurative muddle or momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy virus reframes deception as occlusion, truffle pulp as concealment tool. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity (gold-flecked eye) avoids trope.</comment>
