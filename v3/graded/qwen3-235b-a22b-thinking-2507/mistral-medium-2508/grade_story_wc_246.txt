<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") manifests in pivotal action: writing with dried pen despite years of editing history. Embodied emotion ("strange comfort settling into bones") avoids labels; flaws drive the earned renunciation of correction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens: "future felt less like correction" crystallizes stance with cost ("years trying to edit history"). Orientation clear by para 1; lens taught early via "layered" revelation reconfiguring options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Meteorite pen constrains choice (dipping in breath) and charges final image ("vellum in coat pocket like second heartbeat"). Anomaly's "unbending" actively pressures interpretation, avoiding postcard description through causal role in transmission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (editing vs. layering history) tightens via anomaly's transmission forcing stance crystallization. Cost legible in wasted years correcting past; escalation driven by Elias's agency interpreting signals under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "layering" motif: final image of seeds "stirring in layers of time" reweights failure without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "strange comfort" resolves central question through concrete action ("plant again"), not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time jagged and unreliable"; "smelled of ozone and old parchment") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from dense metaphors to sparse urgency at climax; elision (time distortion) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "words spreading like roots" achieves multi-jobbing without muddle. Final line ("But he knew how to listen. And that was enough.") distills resonance with precise rhythm. Minor register drift in "contingent relationships" costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic tropes through agricultural lens: "wrong seeds/soil" metaphor grounds abstract theme. Risk-taking (quiet closure without action) heightens stakes; emotional specificity avoids generic templates via hydroponic detail.</comment>
