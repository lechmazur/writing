<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (scholarly caution vs. necessary risk) act simultaneously in scene; her final choice to step through the sun is earned by decade of rune studies with visible cost ("became the first shadow to walk at noon"). No therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "fingers tracing cold metal" and micro-choice rolling sleeves.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost: Elara’s voluntary entry into the library forecloses safety, made legible by "she would learn their name" and the automaton’s warning. Hybrid lens (causal progression shifting to accumulative texture at climax) holds consistently; observatory anchoring by line 3 avoids orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—telescope’s distortion becomes the door, gears tilting affects action. "Frost that never melted" and brass dome charge closure, though "perpetual twilight" description edges toward generic. Final image reweighted by stepping through the sun.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: learning shadows "feed" (not vanish) transforms curiosity into survival stakes. One tightening (key turn) narrows options with felt cost ("thirteen years" latency, becoming potential shadow). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her choice to enter the library crystallizes stance under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "relearn the shape of hunger" answers "where shadows go" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by subverting "some doors should never be knocked upon" with "kicked in." Final library image reweights loops/awakenings with conceptual cost, though near-statement in "hunger of the dark" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: astronomer’s lens shapes "stars pulsed like embers," rhythm tightens under stress ("Good. Then I won’t be alone."). Zero POV leakage; syntax varies organically ("The automaton’s fingers curled..."). Elision of Spooning mechanics taught early and paid off in observatory-as-lock reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "Shadows didn’t vanish. They fed." exemplifies propulsion. Every sentence does triple duty (e.g., "frost that never melted" establishes setting/mystery/time distortion). No figurative muddle—final "library of sealed doors" feels concrete. Highest prose density in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "awakening" trope via specific mechanics (Spoon reality, shadow feeding). Emotional truth in scholar’s obsession; risk-taking (no battle, just stepping through light) heightens stakes. "Relearn" as core action feels fresh, though "Unspoken Cycle" edges toward familiar archetype without sufficient distinction.</comment>
