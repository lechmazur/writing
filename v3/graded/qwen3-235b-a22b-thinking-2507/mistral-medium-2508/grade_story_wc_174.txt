<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("reversed the purpose entirely") and embodied emotion (hands' stillness vs. nature) drive the pivotal closure choice to "let puppets stumble," with visible cost in abandoned methodology. Miner's off-page outburst applies immediate pressure without flattening Elias' complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "half-lit epiphanies weren’t about clarity, but about the shape of the dark" reconfigures the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens. Single deepening ("reversed the purpose") suffices for length, though miner incident resolution lacks visible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dome functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (acoustics for storytelling, "deaf" history informing epiphany), while the stick charges closure as "glowing secret." Salt flats' erasure motif ("remembered every footprint and erased it by dawn") directly mirrors Elias' thematic realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) tightens through Elias' internal deepening ("space between the told and the teller"), with cost legible in abandoned precision. Pressure grows accumulatively, but miner's outburst lacks tangible consequence beyond reflection, limiting escalation impact under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("half-lit, some things were bright enough to see by") offers resonant answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges through stick/dome particulars rather than abstraction, avoiding Thematic Echo despite "ethical storytelling" phrase early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("letters seemed to breathe," "wind carried names of things no one had finished saying") modulates rhythm under pressure. Voice remains Elias-specific through "meteor hush" cadence shift at climax, with zero head-hopping in single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "damp wool and old paper, the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing barely touches peak beat but avoids muddling closure's "shape of the dark" crystallization.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of calligrapher/puppeteer exploring truth through imperfection feels inevitable. "Puppet’s string" metaphor transforms storytelling tropes via salt flats' erasure logic, with risk-taking (lyric closure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
