<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in Elias’s preservation/destruction dilemma; embodied emotion via metal fingers on petals and hitching diaphragm avoids cliché. "Static" metaphor skirts diagnostic label-speak near climax but saved by physical cost of abandoning the dome.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Elias stepping into the desert after miniaturizing his fears into the pyre. Orientation anchors by line 5 (dome, twin suns, 127 years), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the box’s evolving significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains every choice: magnetic shifts tug metal bones, dome glass refracts light, and the petrified wood box charges the final image. "Dunes stretched endlessly, untamed, unminiaturized" reweights the farm’s purpose through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preservation through destruction) tightens under magnetic pressure. Elias’s agency in lighting the match narrows options to "flames don’t stop" vs. stagnation, with visible cost in abandoning the dome—a trade-off earned by the box’s pyre.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the box’s physical artifacts: mirror shard cracking and sand hissing reweight "containment" without moralizing. Final image of Elias stepping into the desert offers non-literal answer to miniaturization’s cost, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Android POV filters all perception ("loam" not dirt, "diaphragm hitched"); rhythmic control peaks in "dunes stretched endlessly, untamed, unminiaturized." No head-hopping, and lyrical compression taught early pays off in the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "static in his chest cavity wasn’t from faulty wiring" compresses character and conflict. Minor deduction for "squirmed, not with malice" slightly anthropomorphizing fears in high-pressure beat, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms android tropes through magnetic north shifts and miniaturized ecosystems. "Strangely organic" roses and fear box create fresh inflection where controlled burn becomes emotional catharsis—specific synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
