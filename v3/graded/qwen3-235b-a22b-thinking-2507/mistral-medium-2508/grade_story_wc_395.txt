<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lena’s professional detachment vs. visceral reaction to brother’s patch; embodied choices like zooming on scrawled numbers deepen motivation. Slight underdevelopment of corporate role’s moral ambiguity weakens final renunciation’s earned weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds flawlessly: numbers sequence drives escalation to Charged Poise closure where Lena’s deletion choice carries visible cost ("flagged for termination"). Orientation anchors within 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor convenience in server coordinates slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mission patch functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (triggers hologram) and charges the final image pressed to Lena’s chest. Server Farm coordinates provide spatial coherence, though "ghost-light" metaphor borders generic. Meets 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lena’s agency: discovering redirected files narrows options to override or comply, with system alarms and termination flag proving cost. "They unwrote us" deepens conflict meaningfully. Slight expositional dip in "EchoNet consumed it" momentarily stalls pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: the restored lullaby and silent archive reweight memory’s cost without moralizing. Final image ("archive was silent") answers "where lost things go" through charged absence, avoiding thematic echo. Organic resonance elevates beyond digital elegy tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in archive-focused observations ("servers pulsing with ghost-light"); rhythm accelerates during search ("pulse syncing with server’s thrum"). Minor register drift when "lied" appears italicized. Consistent psychic distance maintains tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("The archive shuddered, its sensed absence filling with color, with noise, with life"). Final line’s cadence shift recharges "silent" motif perfectly. Only microscopic issue: "recurring numbers" repetition slightly overemphasized but purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms memory-erasure trope via specific corporate archive framing; "unwrote us" concept feels fresh. Emotional truth in sibling bond elevates beyond tech thriller. Risk-taking with digital limbo pays off through concrete stakes, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
