<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal choice; transformation feels unearned despite strong embodied emotion ("thumb to flake’s cool face"). No visible trade-off between fiddler identity and new path weakens 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "He was the song now" crystallizes irreversible identity cost under Accumulative lens. Asphalt rippling into door reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Guardrail becomes door through micro-setting pressure; "pixel by pixel" road charges final image. Sensory details ("ozone and burnt sugar") filter through Elias’s professional bias as fiddler.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single escalation beat (glass visions → road) suffices for length. Agency-driven deepening when Elias plays "road’s name" narrows options; cost legible in "bridge had nothing to do with it."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("song was *hungry*") reweights "amnesty" non-literally without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete actions (sculpting from "ashes of 'never'"), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "wind stutter," "resolution too coarse for truth" reflect fiddler’s auditory bias. Compression taught early ("clockwork birds" vignettes) pays off in closure’s lyric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; rhythm accelerates with scene needs ("asphalt rippled like water, then parted"). Figurative language serves propulsion without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "amnesty" as pixelated road feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "scaffold wrap flutters" transforms trope through specific craft.</comment>
