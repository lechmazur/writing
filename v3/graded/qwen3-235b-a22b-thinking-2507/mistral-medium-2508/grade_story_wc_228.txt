<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s grief-turned-promise; embodied emotion in shell-painting and cave entry. Slight deduction for "intimately aloof" label without prior behavioral anchors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: jump reconfigures time’s meaning with undeniable cost ("water tasted of salt and old promises"). Accumulative lens held; cost proof crystallized in final pool image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cave’s bioluminescent moss and still pool constrain choice (shell immersion) and charge closure ("water remembered his name"). Shell-as-tool elevates micro-setting beyond atmosphere into causal engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: wrong turn → shell revelation → jump. Cost legible in burned paintings and villagers’ misunderstanding; "temporary eternity" reweights time’s value under accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell’s sunsets reweighted at closure—no moralizing. Final image ("shore where tide never came in") offers resonant answer to grief/time question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: ochre, shell spirals, cave breath. Rhythmic control peaks in cave descent ("jagged shadows like broken teeth"). Minor density in "bioluminescent moss" description slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops, but "pulsed like a slow, underwater heartbeat" creates subtle physical dissonance (heartbeat/internal vs. underwater/external). Final image clarity preserved, yet overwriting in high-pressure beat prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" transforms grief tropes via shell mechanics and cave physics. Risk-taking (lyric time collapse) heightens stakes coherently; avoids safety-middle with visceral cost in jump.</comment>
