<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lysara’s scientific rigor clashing with grief-driven risk-taking; "hands trembled" embodies emotional conflict without labels. Brother’s vision and thumbprint smudge ground motivation in visceral, character-particular stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the blank manuscript and collapsed threshold crystallize irreversible loss. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup; inversion’s "hour" tightens pressure decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Grotto’s inversion physics actively constrains choices (time pressure, floating pebbles) and charges the final image—planting the seed where "mist could feed it secrets" reweights prior exploration with earned cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through Lysara’s agency: reaching for the seed triggers collapse, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in the "blank manuscript" and "smudged print," reconfiguring her path with visceral, felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: seeds as "combinations" of sound/silence reweight knowledge’s cost. Final image ("seed glowed between her ribs") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "where combinations hide" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "prism-mind" fracturing and "clandestinely luminous" phrasing; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure (e.g., short sentences during inversion). Zero POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "jagged rainbows" and "startled fish" achieve high density without muddle. Final line’s propulsion ("waiting") crystallizes closure without overwriting—every phrase charges the stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis: archivist’s "prism-mind" transforms trope into organic conflict driver. Emotional specificity in brother’s thumbprint smudge avoids abstraction; risk-taking (inversion physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
