<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (shepherd vs gatekeeper) drive the climax; releasing the key earns endurance via prior causality. Final notch in key shows visible cost scaling perfectly to length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds through counting ritual; Earned Stasis closure lands with undeniable cost (key's new notch). Orientation clear by 50 words; cost proof explicit in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mantle key) constrains every choice and charges closure via the notch. Fjord’s quiet evolves from atmosphere to pressure during the ship’s vanishing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’ counting agency; black water/burnt copper escalate cost visibly. Ship’s vanishing charges final image but conceptual price slightly abstract for peak band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clock mechanics, not moralizing. Final key notch reweights "razor edges" as irreversible cost—non-literal answer to temporal control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "squinting through cracked goggles"; counting rhythm modulates under stress. Zero register drift even at "pulse roared" intensity peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "water turned black" does triple duty (sensory, escalation, metaphor). Only minor cadence rigidity in counting sequences prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "hydraulic clock shepherd" transforms timekeeping tropes through tactile mechanics. Risk-taking (counting as causal lever) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
