<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hoarding vs sharing sounds) manifest in embodied micro-choices like trembling hands on the music box and the pivotal jar-giving gesture; final renunciation of isolation earned through causality with visible cost in "Elias’s eyes burn."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options through the girl’s visit: "redemption wasn’t in holding tight but in letting go" lands with conceptual cost (fragile music box note, emotional release); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via sensory density escalation to the dunes’ redefined song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dunes and music box constrain choices—sagging balcony forces cautious movement, rusted mechanism resists repair—and charge the final image where the sun "painting the dunes in gold" reweights the opening’s "restless giants" with earned hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the girl’s arrival forces Elias to choose between hoarding echoes or sharing them; his agency in handing her the jar and winding the box narrows options with felt cost (emotional vulnerability), driving the Accumulative escalation toward closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the music box’s "wobbly note" and dunes’ song becoming shared heritage; avoids moralizing by crystallizing "gleaned redemption" in the final image of Elias reaching for another jar, reweighting the opening’s futility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("sand dusting half-finished verses," "brass edges dulled by salt"); rhythmic control shifts from languid dawn prose to staccato tension at the knock, with lyric compression ("the world was full of sounds waiting to be saved") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sealing it before it could dissolve into the endless blue" compresses action, image, and theme in one propulsive line; final image’s "fragile but true" note avoids figurative muddle while charging closure with crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "sound collector" trope through intergenerational lens—Elias’s specific hoarding of "laughter from a market stall" and the girl’s recognition of her grandfather’s hum create emotional authenticity that avoids derivative safety.</comment>
