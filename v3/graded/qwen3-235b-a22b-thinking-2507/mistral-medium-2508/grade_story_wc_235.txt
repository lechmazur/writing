<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (chronicler vs burner) drive the climax; micro-choice to hand over scroll shows value hierarchy. Younger Elias lacks distinct voice in pivotal dialogue, slightly weakening motivation clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: grave emptiness forecloses chronicling path with visceral cost ("ash settled like first snow"). Accumulative lens holds through rune transformations. No orientation debt—anchors established in opening 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cabin’s timber bones and grave constrain choices (burning site, confrontation locus). Scroll’s physicality charges climax. Near-9.0 but mountain setting remains atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics beyond grave placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake ("distill chaos") tightens when scroll burns—renunciation forecloses chronicling with undeniable cost (screaming ash). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; "three...two...one" countdown crystallizes stance with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final "Soared" reweights opening flight dream without moralizing. Theme emerges from scroll’s destruction: narrative as prison. Avoids Thematic Echo—grave inscription ("Keeper of Forgotten Hours") stays diegetic, not authorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind howled like a thing that knew him") persists under pressure. Slight register drift in dual-Elias dialogue ("Did you ever fly?") verges on thematic exposition, diluting voice specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ink shimmered from revision weight" achieves high density. Loses 0.3 for "patchwork of stolen moments" (near-cliché) and minor rhythmic drag in nostalgia reflection. Closure image ("Soared") remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms time-loop trope through chronicler’s rune-distillation mechanic. Freshness in scroll’s destruction liberating Elias while making him "the scream." Avoids derivative premise via specific birch-bark physics and grave confrontation.</comment>
