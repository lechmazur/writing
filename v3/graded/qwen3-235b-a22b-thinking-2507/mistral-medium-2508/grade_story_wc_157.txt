<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak beyond Elias’ charm; librarian/teen lack embodied conflict. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation—Elias’ defiance feels inevitable, not earned through struggle. "Spark of thought" closure avoids tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "gourd rattle seed split open" crystallizes rebellion’s inevitability with conceptual cost. Orientation clear by para 2; accumulative lens holds. Cost proof test fails—no exact sentence showing Elias’ personal forfeiture despite Ministry’s uprooting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains every choice: seeds as syntax, mint scent as camouflage. Final image of splitting gourd recharges "damp earth" motif with undeniable pressure. Micro-setting (soil patterns) directly shapes tactics and closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("thoughts taxable") escalate via planted messages, narrowing options when Susans signal "they know." But external threat remains abstract—drones scan but never confront. Visible price (uprooted gardens) lacks felt cost on Elias; conceptual cost insufficient for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through gardening actions, not moralizing. Final image ("roots do the talking") answers "can thought be taxed?" non-literally. Lacks complexity—Ministry portrayed as pure villain, resistance as uncomplicated heroism, missing moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature impeccable: Elias notices plant textures, not architecture ("crushed mint," "grooves only fingers could read"). Voice modulates under pressure—humming "warps" to evade Algorithm. Zero head-hopping; rhythm mirrors clandestine urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "Algorithm" capitalization jars lexicon but doesn’t obscure closure. "Wild and untamed" borders cliché but redeemed by context. Final line’s "split open in the dark" avoids purple prose while charging closure. Minor register drift in "Neural Ledgers."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Gourd linguistics transform rebellion trope through botany-specific stakes. Risk distinction: mundane gardening tools heighten tension without gimmickry. Derivative premise guardrail cleared—avoids safety middle by making defiance tactile, not theoretical. Emotional specificity elevates trope.</comment>
