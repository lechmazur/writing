<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (pressing lens to resonator) but lacks layered contradictions; motivation clear yet slightly abstract without sufficient embodied conflict escalation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: lens disappearance and bell replacement crystallize conceptual cost with undeniable pressure; Accumulative lens held rigorously from "shattered constellation" to "golden shadows path".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Brass resonator and carbide lens function as active micro-setting that constrains choices (refracting light to create hum) and charges the final image where Liora "was the space between the notes".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as hum evolves into voice, but external pressure (researchers' skepticism) lacks sufficient escalation to narrow options; conceptual cost earned yet slightly abstract during lens disappearance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (bell-striking as "inviting") not abstraction; final bell "unfolding like breath" offers resonant non-literal answer to "texture of connection" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "sound weave between people like thread" embodies bell-ringer POV; syntax compresses appropriately under stress ("the hum deepened into something like a voice") without losing specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shadows pulsed" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor abstract descriptor ("powerfully gentle") prevents 9.5+ but never muddles climax's "hum vibrating in her bones".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes pilgrimage trope through precise sonic details (waterphones, carbide lens); risk-taking in quiet closure where "power grid held" replaces dramatic resolution, heightening emotional truth.</comment>
