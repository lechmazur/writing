<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s "diligently curious" trait drives micro-choices (sketching patterns, holding journal) with embodied contradiction (rule-breaker vs apprentice), but internal conflict lacks layered irrationality at climax—no fear competing with curiosity during the jump.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "stranded luminance flared—then *snapped* into alignment" reconfigures options with visceral cost (hull vibration, crew hush), though phrasebook’s sudden map overlay risks convenience despite early setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains choice (sequence dictates steps) and charges the final image ("clouds curled like ink"); airship’s brass/dust details filter through Liora’s mapmaker bias, avoiding postcard genericism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Accumulative escalation (starlings→hopscotch→phrasebook), but engine failure feels like a separate crisis rather than deepening loop pressure, slightly fracturing lens coherence at peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (light pooling on hopscotch) and final line "Here, the sky remembers" offers resonant non-literal answer; "stranded isn’t an ending" skirts thematic echo but stays grounded in Liora’s embodied realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds curled like ink," noting starlight in cracks") shines, but Veyra’s dialogue lacks voice differentiation—generic authority ("Show me how to jump") misses occupational texture for a captain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops, high density ("stranded luminance" crystallizes concept), but "skepticism melting into wonder" edges toward cliché in final third, narrowly avoiding Q7’s 9+ cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "temporal loop" trope through luminance/hopscotch mechanic; emotional specificity in "pause to see what others rush past" avoids generality, with bold Accumulative risk heightening coherence.</comment>
