<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "some love wasn’t unused. It was just waiting" epiphany, earned through embodied micro-choices like threading the film with "fingers sure now." No diagnostic label-speak; cost legible in rib-space realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly under Accumulative lens: "the silence did" crystallizes options with undeniable cost in "space between her ribs." Orientation flawless by word 40; cost proof evident in final whisper’s softness foreclosing path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting charging closure: projector’s darkness actively shapes Elara’s final choice to "let the dark have its say." Recurring film grain constrains access to letters, though tool specificity could tighten one beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative escalation: storm’s "hushed thunder" vibrating floorboards intensifies pressure until vision hits "like a wave," narrowing options to spatial gaps. Cost legible in rib-space storage, though tightening slightly passive under lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through film grain’s absence-as-presence: "shape of a song waiting to be remembered" reweights "unused love" without moralizing. Final whisper’s softness offers resonant answer to "where do words go," avoiding sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "psychometry reading struck her like a bolt" and "honey left too long in sun" metaphors. Rhythmic control peaks in final paragraph’s cadence shift, though one filter verb ("pressed her palm") slightly dulls immediacy early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; high density in "words unfolded like origami" with clear propulsion. Figurative language avoids muddle even in peak beats ("thick and golden, like honey"), though "as if alive, as if it remembered" borders density in non-critical moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film grain as love’s vessel avoids cliché, with "unused love" transformed through projector mechanics. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though "honey" metaphor slightly familiar; specificity in crystal ball’s "silver mist" elevates.</comment>
