<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes through embodied choices (dovetailing eyes, whispering "to ask not resurrect") and the final renunciation of precision. Flaw (rigidity) actively complicates the incantation attempt, but lacks an earlier micro-choice showing it thwarting action pre-orchard arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "weight familiar now, a counterbalance to the hollow in his chest" and clouded eyes reconfigure his understanding of ambiguity. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the orchard’s brief "remembered green" deepens pressure without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cavern orchard functions as active micro-setting: mineral-drip ecosystem directly constrains choices (withered saplings, dissolving lichen), and the mosaic’s glow in the final image charges closure. Spatial choreography slightly underdeveloped during the mist sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through textural escalation (prism expansion, mist thickening) that reweights the dominant conflict—mapping grief—under accumulative pressure. Cost is visceral (hollow chest, dissolved lichen), though escalation leans slightly passive as the orchard acts upon him rather than through his agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: "algebra of almost," fractured light, and unsolved mosaic. Final image ("moonlight pooled like a question") resonates non-literally without moralizing. Minor slip: "harmonic of a question" edges toward over-explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (mathematical lexicon coloring sensory detail: "coefficients," "phosphorescent mist") modulates rhythm under pressure. Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Flawless propulsion: every sentence multi-tasks (e.g., "The clear eye caught the light first... orchard remembered green" merges action, image, emotional shift). Zero loops or figurative muddle, even in peak beats like the weeping eye dissolving lichen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through mathematical lens and tangible objects (glass eyes as "counterbalance"). Fresh synthesis feels inevitable—"algebra of almost" avoids abstraction via orchard’s mineral logic. Cavern orchard concept slightly familiar despite precise execution.</comment>
