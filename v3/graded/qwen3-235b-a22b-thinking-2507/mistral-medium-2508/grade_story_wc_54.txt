<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Motivation rooted in engineer’s problem-solving ("dismantling problems like rusted gears"), embodied emotion in discovery beats. Micro-choice to repurpose terminal earns closure. Minor deduction: internal conflict between duty and curiosity slightly underdeveloped despite ink-stained fingers signaling tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: terminal dimming "in quiet satisfaction" crystallizes Lena’s realization that hope is redirection, not destination. Accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition. Deduction: water-resurrection slightly risks convenience but cost ("carnival had taken the belief") is unmistakable on page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Terminal functions as micro-setting constraining choices: corroded steel ribs dictate navigation, water flows enable repurposing. Final image (weather vane pointing to horizon) charges closure. Deduction: "sky the color of old bruises" borders cliché but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belief in escape vs abandonment) signaled early via "fleeting attraction" hope. Pressure deepens through Lena’s mapping of "terminal’s new rhythm," narrowing options to repurposing. Cost legible in town’s lost belief. Deduction: carnival’s pressure could be slightly more active beyond scent/memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete equation: "Hope = Flow × Resistance" reweights sextant’s meaning without moralizing. Final image (weather vane pointing horizon) resonates as non-literal answer to "how to move forward." Zero thematic echo; insight earned via hydroponics bay mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct engineer’s perceptual signature: "traced contours," "calculated" not cheered. Rhythm modulates from clinical ("corroded steel") to lyrical ("whispered like a countdown"). Deduction: "bruised sky" cliché slightly mars voice consistency despite contextual redemption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density: "trampled grass and faint scent of burnt sugar, as if hope itself had been a fleeting attraction" compresses theme/setting. Final line "recalibrating" crystallizes motif without overwriting. Deduction: "old bruises" metaphor is minor register drift but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: engineering mindset applied to emotional landscape ("redirection" as flow equation). Tropes transformed via specific hydroponics mechanics and sextant’s function. Risk-taking (hope as physics equation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Deduction: carnival framing slightly familiar but redeemed by execution.</comment>
