<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("respect was just another kind of fear") and embodied emotion ("fingers trailing the quartz") power micro-choices under pressure. Final renunciation of certainty as boundary earns visible cost but lacks genuine struggle; transformation feels too seamless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("boundaries were only as solid as the fear that held them") crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (lake thawing). Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density escalation, though elders' fear lacks tangible consequence on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: quartz colonnade constrains every choice (dissolving edges, rewriting glyphs) and charges the final image ("walked back into the spiral"). Frozen lake actively alters tactics via ice fracturing, avoiding postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boundaries vs transformation) tightens through hum's escalation and ice fracturing. Protagonist agency drives deepening ("ban had never been about keeping them out"), but external pressure from hesitant figures remains underutilized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "paraphrase" motif reweighted at closure ("world would paraphrase itself") without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "certainty was just another boundary" edging close; earned complexity lingers through conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lantern-moth hush," "mirror-still surface") shows rhythmic control under pressure. Register drift in "verses stitched from the ephemeral" violates POV plausibility for a working poet during high-stakes return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops in closure beat with high density ("glyphs rewriting themselves in her wake"). Minor paraphrase loop ("atrum had not changed"/unchanged description) in para 3 costs 0.2; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "returning exile" trope through quartz's physical paraphrasing mechanics. Risk-taking in accumulative escalation heightens stakes, though emotional arc leans conventional; specificity ("cobalt atrium," "cloud-shadow poet") avoids genericity.</comment>
