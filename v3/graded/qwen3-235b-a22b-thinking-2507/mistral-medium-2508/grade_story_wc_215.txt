<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (deliberate exhale after years of silence) and embodied motivation ("silence a counterbalance"), but ghosts' non-human nature limits relationship-as-crucible depth despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly—"closed fingers around nothing" crystallizes the cost of untangling the covenant, with Accumulative/Textural lens holding through cadence shifts ("sound of a thousand wings unfurling") and visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (handprint in cracked light), while the oasis's sand-swallowed hives constrain all choices—proving essential when the comb's light replaces vanished nectar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by beekeeper's agency (exhale triggering the seam's shiver) narrows options to one decisive choice, with cost unmistakable in the empty box's weightlessness—a perfect tightening under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "silence is not surrender" reframed by the wind's new breath-like movement, avoiding moralizing while offering a resonant answer to the central covenant question via the bees' persistent hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading wind’s warnings in light bent through cracks") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control, while purposeful elision (ghosts as "pressures") teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final pollen-carried name.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "golden tears" slightly risks cliché but "light instead of nectar" redeems it, though minor figurative muddle in "tuning forks" prevents 9.5+ in peak ghost pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trope transformation via beekeeper’s mute eloquence feels inevitable—silence as active choice, not absence—while the covenant reframes ecological grief into a fresh synthesis where ghosts hum with names, not regret.</comment>
