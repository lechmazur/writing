<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s trembling hands (not cold) and shift from reactive archiving to active heartening; embodied epiphany when he understands silences are "full" avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: tossing the valve crystallizes options ("Blow when ready") with felt cost—the exile’s end reweights the harbor’s "absence" as sufficient, under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The trumpet valve functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (Elias listens instead of blows) and charging the final image—glinting in the child’s hand as "absence was enough."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elias realizes the city needs "someone to stitch gaps," foreclosing his initial goal of herald restoration; the cost is visible in his shifted tactics ("heartened," not recorded).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the broken piano’s "wrong in all the right ways" rejects tidy resolution, offering a resonant answer to "navigated absences" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("cobblestones like spines of forgotten books"); rhythmic control peaks in climax ("He didn’t stand... climbed to lighthouse roof") with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "syncopated like harbor’s pulse" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight register drift in "stubborn hopes" (generic) but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms exile tropes via "ocean-spray archivist" reframing memory as active healing; risk-taking (silence as full) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
