<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (fear vs. duty) powers the climax, but claustrophobia fades too abruptly during transition, weakening embodied cost at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (water drop vanishing) reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost; tidal time pressure lacks active constraint on choices despite clear signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cables function as micro-setting that constrains choice (phase seam navigation) and charges the final image (blue glow in water drop), meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through detector/gold fleck interaction, but tidal deadline remains abstract urgency rather than actively narrowing tactics during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cables-as-memory motif; final image ("something turned over in its rest") offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("jagged shadows," "crashing hush") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in transition beat ("world dissolving into a crashing hush") is masterful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "trembling like a held note" achieves textural specificity without muddle, though "clausrophobia" typo slightly dulls immersion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms undersea cables from tech trope into metaphysical memory vessels; risk-taking (phase seam as space-divider) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
