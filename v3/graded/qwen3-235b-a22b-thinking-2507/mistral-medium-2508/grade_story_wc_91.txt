<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "laughed, sharp and bright, because of course she would fulfill it by accident" as micro-choice crystallizes her accidental agency; ash reflection forces credible renunciation with visible cost in "roughened her, polished her."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "less and more than she'd been," sustained under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density (hush→chorus→breath) reweights stakes; tide recession creates one meaningful tightening with causal precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Black sand actively constrains choices (shifting during tremor, turning gold at climax) and charges final image; mirror shard as micro-setting directly triggers prophecy, satisfying 9+ gate through environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency when she interprets mirror reflection as prophecy and runs toward lava; cost crystallizes in physical transformation ("roughened her, polished her") under Accumulative lens where density increase reweights "texture of transformation" stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("horizon was a blade of gold," trees leaning "as if waiting") offers resonant answer to transformation theme without moralizing; "pocketful of coincidences" reframes generosity through concrete particulars, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "volcano exhaled, its breath a slow curl of embers" with rhythmic control under pressure; elision of backstory taught early through present-moment focus ("A detour, then") pays off in closure's earned simplicity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "glass shattering, the bugs erupting into the night like tiny comets" achieves high density without figurative muddle; final line "island hummed" perfects closure propulsion with concrete specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "destitute philanthropist" through bottled lightning bugs transforms trope via specific alchemy; emotional truth in accidental prophecy fulfillment avoids abstraction while risking structural boldness that heightens stakes.</comment>
