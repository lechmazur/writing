<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("I didn’t come for you" lie), embodied emotion ("hands steady" vs "weight pressing him flatter"), but brother’s jump revelation lacks sufficient prior causality to feel fully earned despite strong flaws-driven choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of knowing pressing him flatter"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation, though truth dump slightly over-relies on exposition rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The seed constrains choices (planted at "strongest pull") and charges closure (withered work done, key’s warmth); micro-setting specificity ("rotting blossoms" scent, mud-kneeling) actively shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) tightens through Eldrin’s agency (seed planting), narrowing options to unbearable knowledge; cost legible in "weight pressing him flatter" with perfect band-guardrail execution for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars ("lake kept them," "silence like hunger"), avoiding moralizing; final image (key burning, snow following) offers resonant non-literal answer to "what truths should stay frozen" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thorned husk promising hunger," "tearing silk" vines) and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("orchard remembering") pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density ("truth unfurled like a blade") avoids figurative muddle while advancing plot; final line’s cadence shift ("snow followed. The key stayed warm.") resolves with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed lake" trope via specific logic (hoarding choices, not souls); emotional truth in Eldrin’s endurance ("silence win") synthesizes premise with fresh stakes, risk-taking heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
