<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses (doubt vs inherited belief) manifest physically in cork-rolling and throat strain; Harkin’s skepticism-to-wonder shift via micro-choices (pocketing cork) earns the closure’s cost without sentimentality. Motivation rooted in maternal legacy avoids therapy-speak through embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: fishermen’s "slower hands" and Harkin’s sagging shoulders crystallize the cost of whispered connection. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup; vibrations reweight the lighthouse’s purpose with felt relational cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The vial cork functions as micro-setting—constraining Elias’s method (scent over sound) and charging the final image when pocketed. Lighthouse vibrations evolve from resistance to resonance, directly shaping tactics and closure’s "invitation" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: scent-beckoning narrows options to a single, precise note, with cost legible in the "clean, bright ache of dawn" and fishermen’s altered behavior. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, foreclosing brute-force methods via earned sensory trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the cork’s warmth, lavender’s fade—not abstraction. Final image ("tend the garden") reweights "whispers travel farther" as active cultivation, avoiding moralizing while resonating with the fishermen’s reconfigured homecoming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("vibrations of intent," "scent of garden at night") filters all observation; rhythm modulates under pressure (e.g., "knife screams" compression). Voice remains Elias-specific without head-hopping, with compression taught early and paid off in closure’s cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "tender, screaming only in its precision" risks slight register drift in high-pressure beat but avoids muddle through visceral knife simile. Zero loops; final line’s "salt and fading lavender" achieves textural specificity without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via scent-based communication and "vibrations of intent," avoiding magical realism clichés. Emotional specificity in Harkin’s change ("shoulders sagged") and the cork’s charged reprise create inevitability, with risk-taking heightening stakes through quiet climax.</comment>
