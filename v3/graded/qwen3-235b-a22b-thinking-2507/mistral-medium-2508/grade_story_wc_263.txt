<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident ("doubt" vs. "creativity trapped in ribs"), but peak-pressure micro-choices lack layered irrationality; the pivotal singing decision feels inevitable rather than contested by simultaneous impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the whispers were gone / quiet so vast it felt like flying" crystallizes the cost of transformed creativity with conceptual weight, holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through escalating sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("instrument warm in her hands"), constraining every choice from trembling approach to singing—environment-as-tool meets 9+ gate with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens is masterful: each star-tracing step intensifies the unwritten calendar’s unraveling while narrowing Liora’s emotional options, with the cost ("whispers gone") unmistakably legible in the quiet after liberation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "she had become the path" reweights the opening archway with earned resonance, avoiding moralizing while answering the central question through the final brushstroke and falling stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "melody in the rustle of her cloak," with rhythmic control tightening during the well scene; purposeful compression taught early pays off in the resonant final line without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "brass drank the light" achieves multi-jobbing density, though "shadowed rapture" slightly verges on stock phrasing—redeemed by immediate contextual specificity in the needle-spinning action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic muse tropes through the artist’s tangible tools (brush, instrument); the unwritten calendar concept synthesizes time and creativity in a non-obvious, character-grounded way that feels inevitable.</comment>
