<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "didn't believe in curses. But believed in patterns" crystallizing into final acceptance; embodied nausea from raw fruit grounds the supernatural turn. Micro-choice of piecing letters shows hierarchy of truth-seeking over self-preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: the humming fruit replaces Elias, reframing all debunking as "fertilizer." Accumulative lens holds from shredded letters to final heartbeat image—density peaks when the stillpoint "pushed back with meaning."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard’s fruit constrains choice (eaten for nausea) and charges closure via the dashboard fruit’s heartbeat. Shattered vials and lead-lined pit function as micro-setting, their physical properties directly enabling the quarantine revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the stillpoint’s "meaning" reveals the Liquidation was a quarantine—not a conspiracy but a cure. Cost crystallizes as Elias realizes his life’s work was "fertilizer," with the ground splitting open as irreversible consequence of his choice to "turn the key."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "fertilizer" metaphor reweights truth-seeking without moralizing. Final image of the humming fruit answers the central question—lies as necessary growth medium—through visceral resonance, avoiding abstract sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: "skeletal trees," "shredded into confetti" reflect Voss’s debunker lens. Under pressure, syntax compresses ("Not with force. With meaning.") without losing coherence. Radio distortion teaches the pattern for the final "You’re next" transmission.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "unspooling" and "refracted" deliver layered meaning efficiently. One paraphrase loop ("ozone, maybe, or the ghost of static") prevents 9+, but final line’s "sound of something growing" achieves crystalline propulsion with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms conspiracy tropes through specific logic: the "cure" reframes the Liquidation as quarantine. Emotional truth in Voss’s shift from skeptic to believer feels earned through orchard’s physical constraints, avoiding gimmickry while heightening stakes.</comment>
