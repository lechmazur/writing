<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("itch" vs commitment) embodied through micro-choices (adding violet, lying about leaving). Flaw: "itch behind ribs" risks diagnostic label-speak but avoids penalty via immediate physical action (rewrapping tin).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (violet transfer) with felt cost (imminent departure). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: density peaks via reprise of tin/violet. Missing: early signal for "itch" trait weakens causality of departure decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (coffee tin) charges closure: false bottom click → violet transfer → rewrapped tin. Library shelves "groaning under weight" directly constrain choices (salvaging books). Moonlight evolves from "clawed free" to "silver wound," mirroring emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via accumulated objects (pressed violet, dead names) but guards remain abstract threat. Escalation relies on Elias' internal "itch" without sufficient on-page pressure. Cost is palpable (departure) yet external conflict lacks concrete manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "rebuilding not with bricks but stolen words." Final image ("two cracks where light gets in") reweights "bloom" motif without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality via specific costs (memorizing dead names, frayed twine).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "prison’s discard pile," "ink made from soot." Rhythmic control peaks in closure ("tucked the violet... night held its breath"). Minor flaw: "itch" description slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Template cadence in climax ("Elias picked up... Maren hummed... When first light...") dulls propulsion. Otherwise: high density ("skeletal thing," "stubborn hope"), strategic telling ("months since collapse"). Final third artifacts cap high-band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prison library as resistance hub via book smuggling, not violence. "Molting names" trope transformed through physical cost (rewrapping tin). Risks lyrical structure but closure remains legible through tactile details (cracked fingers, pressed violet).</comment>
