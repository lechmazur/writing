<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "cursed to know the moment before" and micro-choices like bleeding fingers weaving dust, but precognition's cost isn't tested until climax, slightly underdeveloping the flaw's compounding effect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "dust settled into her bones" and "footsteps the only friction left" crystallize irreversible endurance under Accumulative lens, though the drive lens isn't named until midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tidal bluff constrains every choice (dust only in tide-safe crevices) and charges the finale—footsteps becoming friction reweights the setting's physical logic into thematic cost without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase (aurora fracturing into needle-lines) is driven by Liora's agency; cost is unmistakable in "dust burning through her skin" and the final image's irreversible burden, though the "something older" antagonist lacks concrete pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of footsteps as "only friction left" reweights the promise theme non-literally, avoiding moralizing; "cursed to keep it" reframes grandmother's whisper into earned conceptual cost without thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors leached pale by borrowed dawn") and rhythmic control peak in the climax ("The bluff groaned. The mirror-water shattered."), though "collapsed star dust" slightly drifts from Liora's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "world tilted—just for a heartbeat" advances plot and atmosphere, though "fine as regret" risks stock metaphor but is redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms eel-herding into cosmic duty via dust-as-anchor motif; "promise had never been to her" delivers earned emotional specificity that avoids chosen-one tropes while heightening stakes.</comment>
