<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("hunger" vs implied danger) lacks simultaneous tension; death feels earned but final choice lacks layered values. Copper veins as embodied flaw don't actively constrain choices until too late.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost (Veyra's death), but accumulative lens falters as "hunger" motivation isn't deepened enough to make continuation feel inevitable. Diamond's curse redefinition ("cursed for those who answered") crystallizes stakes perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: echoes trap her ankles, bone towers sing with "crumbling parchment" texture, diamond's flaw charges the final image. Canyon's breath versus Veyra's stillness reweights the entire premise with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Veyra's agency (ignoring tremors, pressing on), but "hunger" isn't sufficiently contrasted with fear to deepen the trade-off. Cost is unmistakable (death), yet the fatal choice lacks moral calculus between competing goods.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("echoes are just sounds that have forgotten how to die") reweights the premise without moralizing, emerging from concrete particulars like the diamond's cracked flaw and starlings' new patterns. Theme of dangerous knowledge resonates through texture, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("grit of consonants," "silk of vowels") and rhythmic control under pressure ("The canyon *inhale*—not wind...") are masterful. Voice modulates seamlessly from quiet articulation to visceral collapse without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fogged the cursed stone" shows concrete action. Minor register drift: "copper in her veins burned with the same hunger" borders on cliché but saved by context. Final image's clarity avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic anthropology and magical realism: starlings as living cipher and copper veins as embodied consequence transform tropes. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
