<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—skepticism versus yearning for Mira—act simultaneously in high-stakes beats; her micro-choices (pressing sliver to temple, painting the door) earn the final renunciation of safe skepticism with visceral cost ("sliver dissolved into her skin").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: Lena's softened skepticism and dissolved sliver crystallize the stakes; Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density escalation ("walls breathed... veins of light") without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Light-painting pigments function as micro-setting that constrains choice (bending light to "show the way back") and charges the final image; studio's static-shock aftermath directly enables the climax's tactile reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens: Lena's choice to "paint" rather than follow narrows options with felt cost (her dissolved certainty); stakes escalate via somatic pressure ("hands trembled") reweighting the dominant conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("colors that need naming," "light-painted door"), avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "belief" as mattering through Lena's action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("ozone and burnt sugar," "fractally precise") remains consistent under pressure; rhythmic control in transformation beat ("The studio lights flickered. Then the walls *breathed*") avoids elision pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "willowglass hope" demonstrates textural specificity without muddle; minor deduction for "copper and lavender" bordering on stock metaphor in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy tropes through art medium specificity; "light-painting studio" setting creates fresh emotional calculus where pigments become navigation tools, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
