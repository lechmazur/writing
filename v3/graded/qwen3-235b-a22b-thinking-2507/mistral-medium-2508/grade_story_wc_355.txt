<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' pacifism vs. necessary action, embodied by trembling hands tracing the sketch. Micro-choices (tuning device, closing diary) reveal hierarchy of values under fireworks pressure. Slight thematic echo in "empathy is a frequency" risks diagnostic label-speak but avoids full penalty through concrete cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Elias stepping into street with "hum in his bones" crystallizes the empathy redefinition with visible cost (abandoned workshop light, loose clasp). Accumulative lens holds—fireworks' cadence tightens the silence-recovery stakes without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Copper plate and diary clasp function as micro-setting that directly constrains choices (tuning unlocks clasp, device hums with Elias' silence). Workshop shadows and fireworks' "staccato heartbeat" evolve with emotional state, charging the final image where "careful hands" noise replaces silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the live clock of approaching fireworks, narrowing Elias' options from recovery to action. Agency drives the tightening: his realization that empathy requires breaking silence forces the streetward choice with felt cost (lost workshop solitude). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vibration-language and "silence repaired" sign—no moralizing. Final image of mending music boxes with "careful hands" reweights empathy as active participation. Avoids sentimentality but "maybe empathy wasn’t just about hearing quiet" edges toward thematic echo, narrowly escaping Q5 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives: "collected silences like stamps," "hand slanted like a sigh." Rhythm modulates from hushed workshop sentences to fragmented urgency during fireworks. Zero POV slips; compression in "He didn’t need to force the lock anymore; he just needed to listen" serves pressure perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion shines with varied syntax ("The workshop smelled..."), but minor synonym churn in "silence that wasn’t empty but full—of echoes, of choices." No closure-dulling artifacts. Final line’s "careful hands" avoids overwriting while charging the theme. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms pacifism trope through vibration-based silence cataloging. The "locked clasp opened by frequency" mechanic feels fresh, avoiding gimmickry by constraining plot. Emotional truth in Elias' avoidance-to-action arc; specificity of "crescent moon clasp" and "jagged line" elevates beyond template.</comment>
