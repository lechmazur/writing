<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction: Lira's vulnerability-driven dance embodies "strength in setting free" versus the scientist's fear-based encryption. Embodied emotion ("bare feet found the cold floor’s rhythm") avoids therapy-speak, but micro-choices lack visible struggle during the pivotal dice roll, slightly weakening causality for the closure choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the lab's destruction and dissolution of secrets are legible in "water rushing into the lower chambers" and "journals would dissolve." Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 1, and the Accumulative/Textural lens (pressure through sensory density) holds flawlessly through the final ascent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken lab’s water pressure directly constrains choices—rising water forces Lira’s final dance and escape—while the dice and shattered vial charge the closure. Micro-setting (dice patterns traced on skin) reweights the ending, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making environment inseparable from the final image’s cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the dice roll triggers the lab’s response, narrowing options to dance-or-drown. Cost is visceral in the flooding chambers and dissolved journals, but the single deepening lacks a visible trade-off (e.g., no moment where Lira hesitates despite risk), limiting escalation intensity under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The final image—"she had decoded it into her own"—resonantly answers the central question (can vulnerability be strength?) without moralizing. Theme emerges purely through embodied action (dance as liberation), avoiding abstraction, though "the only kind of strength worth having" risks slight thematic echo without sufficient prior friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s perceptual signature shines in textural details ("greenish glow painting the sunken laboratory"), with rhythm modulating to match pressure (shorter phrases during the dance). But "vulnerable and unbroken parts of herself" drifts toward abstract diction under peak stress, slightly muddying the POV’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("clattered," "groaned," "kicked off"). Figurative language ("ocean’s currents swirled like a spider spinning its web") serves tension without muddle. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near closure prevents 9.5, but closure imagery remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing dance as decryption—a fresh inflection where movement replaces logic. Specificity ("hangman’s dice patterns on her skin with ink") avoids tropes, but the sunken-lab premise risks familiarity without the scientist’s poetic encryption twist elevating it beyond standard underwater mystery.</comment>
