<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in feeding doubt to the crozier, but "gnawing certainty that he’d spent his life chasing a lie" veers toward diagnostic label-speak under peak pressure, risking the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the guild fleeing and Elias tracing the "cracked" future, but the silent explosion’s time-stutter physics slightly undermines causality in the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crozier functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (humming like a second heartbeat), yet the ember nexus’s "molten copper veins" remain atmospheric rather than constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten decisively when the crozier shudders at doubt-feeding, narrowing options to "let it be worse"; the guild’s visceral flight crystallizes the conceptual cost under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unmaking damage" mechanics rather than statement; the final "cracked" future reweights destruction as generative without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo traps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("sickly gold like light filtered through bruised skin"), but "penny drops" repetition in Q9H creates a minor cadence loop that dulls momentum near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts, yet "crystallized into blackened lace" followed by "crystal petals" risks synonym churn; high density otherwise propels with rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unmaking damage" transforms alchemy tropes through specific mechanics; emotional truth in scar-reversal avoids gimmickry while heightening stakes coherently to the humming crozier payoff.</comment>
