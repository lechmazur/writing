<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; her blind spot drives plot but final realization lacks visible cost escalation. Pilgrim remains symbolic rather than fully realized character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—unpredictability as promise—but "feels like a promise" abstracts cost; misses Q2 9+ test’s concrete cost proof at "Lira knows the future will remain unseen".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal cave constrains choice (floor syncs heartbeat) and charges final image; micro-setting of shadows weaves ribbons that alter tactics. "Bright darkness" motif charges closure without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (magnifying magic) signaled early, but escalation isn’t driven by Lira’s agency—the cave acts upon her. Cost felt but not through protagonist choice; misses Q4 9+ test’s agency requirement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("unseen forces... magnify magic hidden in everyday breath") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Theme emerges from cave pearl’s amber tear transforming shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows moved like slow tides", "crystal droplets fall silently") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "feels both ancient and newly born" slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synonym loops ("steady hum"/"steady unpredictability") and redundant "bright darkness" repetitions in final beats reduce density; "warm shawl" metaphor slightly strains physical logic of darkness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms crystal cave trope through "overlapping shadows" mechanics; risk-taking with lyric structure pays off via cave pearl’s amber tear reweighting stakes. Specific "seed-filled bread" detail avoids abstraction.</comment>
