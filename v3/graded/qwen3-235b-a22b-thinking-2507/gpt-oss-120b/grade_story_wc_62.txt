<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear (mapping grief) with concrete interiority ("fiercely meditative river"), but Mara's abrupt spectral arrival lacks causal setup, weakening Eliam's agency. Contradictory impulses shown via ribbon/poem ritual, yet mentorship feels externally imposed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Eliam accepts grief's "flowing tapestry" shape (coiled heart basin), with legible cost in "felt the weight." However, Mara's coincidental appearance violates Accumulative/Textural lens coherence by introducing unearned external guidance at the critical turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: light patterns dictate carving, butterflies determine spiral placement. Final image ("stone sang with soft hum of butterflies") directly charges closure through environmental integration, exceeding 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (jagged scar vs. flowing grief) deepen through density accumulation, but protagonist agency falters—Eliam primarily observes while Mara directs ("Mara asked him"). Escalation lacks meaningful protagonist-driven tightening despite solid cost ("felt the weight") under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: butterflies as fragmented grief, basin as functional sorrow. Final image reweights premise without moralizing ("grief was not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry"), perfectly satisfying the 9+ quick test with resonant conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice excels with carver-specific perceptual signature ("shivered stone into solemn names") and rhythmic control, but minor POV leakage occurs when describing Mara's listening ("presence felt in soft rustle") beyond Eliam's plausible knowledge, slightly undermining focalization stability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with near-zero scaffolding, though "quiet, thundering calm" repetition risks slight cadence rigidity in high-pressure beats. No fatal artifacts—figurative language consistently serves accumulation without muddling closure's visceral charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms tropes: grief as butterfly migration mapped via ribbon/poem ritual avoids sentimentality. Emotional specificity ("flock of butterflies that fluttered through years") and risk-taking (lyric structure) heighten stakes while maintaining conceptual integrity through closure.</comment>
