<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("discover meaning in margins") drives ritual but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure are implied rather than embodied, weakening closure's earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("margins held luminous stories"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens weakens slightly as chalk-to-hologram progression feels predetermined rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Golden arcade and chalk symbols function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("edges shimmering with meaning"), with sensory details (dawn light on chalk, clipboard glow) constraining Mara's ritual actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as chalk code intensifies into quantum projection, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; cost ("weight of every chalk line") feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "margins" motif without moralizing; the final image reweights surface mail as "luminous stories" with conceptual cost, avoiding sentimentality while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature ("neon signs flickered like distant memories") with rhythmic control, though slight register drift occurs when describing "quantum projection" in otherwise tactile prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters in climax with back-to-back figurative language ("vibrated, edges shimmering with meaning... pulse of encoded hope"), creating minor scaffold that dulls closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Surface mail as ceremonial conduit" transforms a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices; risk-taking in merging analog/digital aesthetics heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "futuristic nostalgia" borders on overused.</comment>
