<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; micro-choices under pressure (thread projection, rose revival) reveal values, yet flaw-driven struggle remains abstract without concrete setbacks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (endless work foreclosing rest), but the Accumulative/Textural lens weakens mid-scene as atmospheric buildup outpaces tangible pressure escalation on the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden functions as micro-setting: wilted rose's revival directly constrains the traveler's choice (writing obituary as waypoint), charging the final image where soil "waiting to be healed" reweights loss into hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the traveler's realization that "work was never finished," but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; atmospheric shifts (shadows receding) complicate without narrowing options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rose's obituary as "waypoint," avoiding moralizing; the final image ("map his own words had drawn") offers resonant answer to "explained absences" without stating a moral, though "geography of healing" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("damp amber," "bruised violet") modulates rhythm under pressure; purposeful compression ("intimate projection" replacing explanation) taught early pays off in closure's lyrical cadence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "sigh of rustling leaves" and "lonesome splendor" verge on cliché; high density falters in mid-scene where "projected his presence" lacks concrete mechanics, slightly dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms obituary trope through thread-projection mechanics; "palace carpet weft" as mapping tool feels specific and inevitable, though autumn garden risks seasonal cliché without the rose's charged revival reconfiguration.</comment>
