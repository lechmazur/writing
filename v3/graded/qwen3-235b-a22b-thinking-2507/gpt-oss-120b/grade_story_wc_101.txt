<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied responsibility ("pressure on shoulders") but lacks contradictory impulses; Mara's flaw remains abstract despite clear motivation. Micro-choices like bell-ringing reveal values, but no visceral struggle against sanctions' strain limits depth at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test failure: "who/where/when" unclear past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff. Accumulative lens holds with Earned Stasis closure (bell's echo as enduring promise), but mid-story deepening lacks pressure escalation—success feels unearned without visible cost spikes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and bell constrain choices (donation hollow, ringing protocol), charging the final image. Sensory specificity excels ("straw," "dulled silver"), but ridge setting remains backdrop without altering tactics—environment doesn't actively shape the midnight runs' execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (feeding community) signaled early but never intensify; sanctions pressure stays static. No narrowing of options or visible cost escalation—volunteers succeed repeatedly without complication. "Amplified quiet" concept deepens theme but fails to test Mara's resolve under mounting risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</comment><comment>Theme of intergenerational solidarity emerges organically through bell-passing promise, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "amplified quiet" into resilient hope, but thematic resonance is undercut by underdeveloped conflict—closure lacks the conceptual cost needed for higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice mastery: "amplified quiet" motif creates distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic cadence shifts (dawn calm vs. midnight tension). Prose modulates under pressure ("lanterns flickering like fireflies"), though one filter-verb stack ("Mara watched... felt") slightly dulls immediacy in closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "gently persistent" label repeats without showing tradeoffs (Q9D). "Amplified quiet" overused (6x), bordering on template cadence. Final line's "faded into memory" slightly muddles closure image, but lyrical density and clean syntax elevate execution despite artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exile resilience through bell ritual avoids trope. Emotional specificity in "children learning sack-tying" grounds universality, but "sanctions period" feels underdeveloped as a fresh inflection—lacks the bold risk-taking needed for 9+ despite strong thematic integration.</comment>
