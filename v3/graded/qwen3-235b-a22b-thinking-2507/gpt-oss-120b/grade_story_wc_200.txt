<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation for integrating laughter is clear but interior contradiction under pressure is thin; "modestly fearless" lacks active fear to counterbalance. Epiphany about laughter's power feels slightly unearned without deeper struggle against Mara's own grief. No diagnostic label-speak, but the "luminous ache" refrain risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost: Mara's softened ache and the tooth's glow reconfigure grief into hope. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (harp notes, laughter) tightens the dominant stake. Cost proof is legible in "ache in her chest soften," though emotional transformation could feel more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as active micro-setting: slick stones impede movement, water echoes shape listening tactics, and the gorge's "exhale" directly releases spirits. The crocodile's tooth charges the final image as a "beacon," constraining every choice from pursuit to closure. Sensory details are selective and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds: harp's discordant notes intensify density until laughter triggers transformation. Mara's agency in telling the joke narrows options with visible cost (emotional vulnerability). Stakes remain visceral through "fragile thread of pain" imagery, though the cost could deepen beyond softening ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: laughter's healing power reweights grief without moralizing. Final image of "joyous hum" offers resonant, non-literal answer to sorrow, charged by the tooth's glow. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars like the goat joke, making complexity feel earned rather than imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in vibration-focused noticing ("notes bent the air"), but stress compression falters during climax—syntax stays equally lyrical when tension peaks. Voice modulates beautifully with sunrise imagery, though "luminous ache" repetition risks scaffold. No POV slippage; single-POV consistency maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: sentences vary rhythm (short staccato for action, flowing for reflection), but "luminous ache" appears twice in adjacent beats, creating a minor paraphrase loop. Zero figurative muddle; "sunrise glass" and "fireflies" metaphors stay coherent. Final line’s "symphony of light and ache" avoids overwriting through specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief-healing trope via concrete mechanics: misaligned harp as guide, crocodile tooth resonance, and goat joke as catalyst. Emotional specificity in "laughter stitching torn fabric of souls" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry—the gorge’s sentient hum feels inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
