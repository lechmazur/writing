<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid through wood grain and sap pockets, but "grief is both here and gone" edges toward thematic labeling rather than character-specific thought. Final endurance (placing lantern on hearth) earns closure with "invisible lines of time" cost. Micro-choices like pressing glass over sap show contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "loss can be a tool, not a trap" reconfigures meaning with felt cost in "weight of the ash wood carving blank now finished." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through steam→sap hardening density. Sap-to-amber transformation slightly convenient but cost legible in "invisible lines of time."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Loft actively constrains choice: rain beads as metronomes dictate rhythm, steam timing her work. Final "mosaic of moments captured in glass" charges closure through micro-setting. Rust hue deepening to amber mirrors emotional shift without overt symbolism. Environment shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (containing grief) escalate through steam→sap hardening→glass pressing with visible cost in "invisible lines of time." Agency strong but "circus alchemists" whisper introduces convenient resolution. Tightening via kettle's boil-to-clear vapor creates meaningful cadence shift narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "roar turned to sigh" and "rust-hued peace" deepening to amber—zero moralizing. Final image reweights grief as "quiet beacon" without stating wisdom. Avoids sentimentality; "mosaic of moments" offers resonant answer to "here and gone" with undeniable cost in "invisible lines."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("steam traced silver veins," "pockets of sap emerged") but "grief is both here and gone" disrupts POV with abstract thought. Rhythm varies with scene pressure yet minor filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "rust-hued peace holding the world in a single breath" compresses time/space/emotion. "Tiny metronomes" replaces abstract time with concrete image. Near-flawless density but "hauntingly practical" slightly elevated for POV lexicon in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via circus widow's woodcraft: ash wood→amber lantern crystallizes "here and gone" with "roar to sigh" specificity. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off; "mosaic of moments" avoids sentimentality. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
