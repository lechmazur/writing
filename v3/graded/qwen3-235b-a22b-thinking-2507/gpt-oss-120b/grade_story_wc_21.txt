<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "searing reverie" relies on abstract labels rather than embodied contradiction; Mara's broadcast choice feels earned, yet emotional progression lacks visceral cost in pivotal moments like the lagoon descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the broadcast's ripple effect, but cost remains conceptual—no on-page sentence concretely shows Mara's sacrifice beyond "weight lifting," weakening Accumulative lens impact at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon's violet light actively constrains choices (hand-dip decoding) and charges the final image; debris arrangements vibrate dunes to unlock passage, fulfilling the 9+ gate for micro-setting driving tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. suppression) tighten through debris negotiation, but escalation lacks visible cost—Qadir's parley resolves too neatly without tradeoffs, failing to reweight pressure under the Accumulative lens despite strong density buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (sea-glass shards → dune hum), avoiding moralizing; "silence cracked" offers resonant CR, though "new covenant" edges toward tidy resolution without deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("brass hull humming like a distant prayer") shines, but elevated diction like "retrocognitively trapped" drifts from archivist lexicon during high-pressure decoding beats, slightly muddling voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and textural specificity, yet filter-verb stacks ("Mara felt the weight") in the final third dull closure's immediacy, triggering a -0.5 artifact penalty and capping high-band eligibility per rubric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific stakes (debris-encoded cipher), but "obsidian lagoon" leans derivative; risk-taking in retrocognitive mechanics feels inevitable in hindsight, elevating stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
