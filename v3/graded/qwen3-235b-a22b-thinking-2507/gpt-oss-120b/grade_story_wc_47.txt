<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s "protected vulnerability" as she grafts meaning onto grief; embodied emotion through moss responses and pendant warmth avoids stock phrasing. Final choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond the ecosystem transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (pain transformed into "gentle knowledge"), but lens ambiguity between Accumulative/Textural and Hybrid slightly weakens causality at the drip-pattern climax where coincidence aids discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The moss garden constrains every choice—server-touching, stone-placement, pendant-use—charging the final image where fireflies mirror amber glow. Environmental specificity ("circuit vines," "cracked glass floor") elevates beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency (proffering stones, using pendant as key), but the viral confession’s pressure dissipates too cleanly; the cost of healing feels diffuse rather than viscerally paid in her physical/emotional state during the transmission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "honeyed hush" reconfiguration—from breathing rhythm to digital lullabies—avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "stitch together a future" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "verdant hush" and "drip of thawing icicles"; rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("rewriting the server’s memory banks with stories of loss"). Zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop with "proffer" (three near-identical uses); otherwise masterful density ("garden acknowledged her hidden grief without judgment"). Final image’s "drip, every pendant, every proffered stone" slightly overwrites closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tech decay and organic renewal feels inevitable; "circuit vines" and "data transformed into organic rhythm" avoid tropey eco-tech clichés. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
