<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("hidden truths") is concrete but lacks contradictory impulses; final choice to hand over the nib has no visible cost or struggle, reducing earned endurance. Interiority avoids labels yet omits authentic tension when stakes demand it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Charged Poise (ledger revealed, archives opening) under Accumulative lens, but cost ("orbits of regret unwinding") remains conceptual, not legible on-page. Siren's arrival feels coincidental, not earned by pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (telescope hum like "rustle of newspaper pages") anchor atmosphere, but the observatory setting never constrains choices or alters tactics—it's ornamental backdrop, not micro-setting that charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. cover-up) is clear early, but pressure never escalates: inserting the nib works immediately with no resistance, narrowing, or cost paid. Journalist's arrival resolves conflict coincidentally, undercutting agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action ("nib etched a line that unraveled the cipher"), avoiding moralizing. Final image (heavens "turning pages of a fresh edition") reweights "orbits of regret" with conceptual cost, no stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ink once fell like rain on dead stories") filters all details through newsroom logic. Rhythmic control under pressure ("solemn playfulness" modulating to grin) with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with purposeful metaphors ("floating thought, solemn yet playful"), but minor muddiness in mid-beats (e.g., "orbits of regret" description strains coherence). Zero loops or scaffold in closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalism/math motifs transforms tropes: "proof by contradiction" as narrative method feels inevitable. Avoids derivative safety with specific, verifiable details (rhyme-decrypted ledger in archives).</comment>
