<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("understand what clocks really measure") without contradictory impulses in scene; final renunciation lacks visible cost despite strong embodied details like "thoughts settle like sediment." No second character to test relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("horizon dissolved into pure light") reconfigures meaning but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; orientation succeeds early with horizon station, yet lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Situational) undermines escalation coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hydraulic machinery functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (key turning syncs heartbeat), but "fjord quiet" remains decorative; silver glass water and gear tremors charge atmosphere without directly altering tactics at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("measuring horizon paradox") lacks concrete pressure; counting backwards shapes rhythm but fails to narrow options or impose cost—tide pausing feels inevitable rather than earned through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "intervals between breaths," avoiding moralizing; final image ("step echoing rhythm") risks thematic echo but earns resonance via hydraulic ritual. No tidy resolution, yet conceptual cost lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber and steel" glare, "metallic scent") with rhythmic control in counting sequences; lyrical compression taught early pays off at closure. Minor register drift in "eminent peculiar" avoids fatal convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Template cadence in counting beats ("each reversal a note... each pulse sent") creates scaffold loops; filter-verb stack in epiphany ("he realized... understood") dulls immediacy. No closure artifacts, but density issues in high-pressure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hydraulic timekeeping with fjord ecology transforms tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes. "Breath of stone" echoes existing motifs but specificity of gear mechanics ("razor edges") provides irreplaceable texture.</comment>
