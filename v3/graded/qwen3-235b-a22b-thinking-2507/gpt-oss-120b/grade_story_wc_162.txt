<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("shedding weight of loss like leaves"), but "featherly determined" remains label without sufficient action-cost demonstration in pivotal seam-discovery moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (threshold-as-memory with corn husk scent), but orientation falters: "drifting prism terrace" spatial logic remains ambiguous past 120 words without serving closure payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: copper plate vibrations and shifting-ink maps constrain choices, yet "amber stalks" description lacks causal pressure on final threshold crossing despite vivid sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens via "necessary distances" density increase, but butterfly effect timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics despite strong cost in "shedding weight of loss."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "thresholds as sacred pauses," avoiding moralizing, though "true distance between wonder and understanding" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient concrete reweighting in final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("grain whispered of storms past"), but tense shifts ("He recalled his mother's lesson") risk POV leakage without micro-choice anchoring in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with resonant phrases ("fractured hush"), yet "featherly determined" repetition and copper-wood vibration description risk overwriting in corridor discovery beat without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maze architecture and weather codes feels inevitable, but "butterfly effect" reference leans derivative without transformative stakes integration beyond atmospheric naming.</comment>
