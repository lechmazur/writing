<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Selene’s embodied contradiction shines in high-pressure moments: "renegotiated the terms... by offering the missing page" shows resourcefulness as costly sacrifice, not competence porn. Final portal step earns closure through visible cost (diary’s surrender) with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "mountain exhaling" crystallizes stakes with felt cost of diary’s sacrifice. Under Accumulative lens, density escalates via botanical gaps → voids → symphony swell without causality breaks. Cost proof: "long held breath" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bookstore’s voids actively constrain choices (alchemical treatises collapse triggers discovery). Botanical diary functions as micro-setting charging the finale: "clasped to her chest" as she steps through. Sensory hierarchy perfectly filters through linguist’s ear ("low chord," "phosphorescent fungi chorus").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Selene’s agency: researching gaps narrows options (third gap → cavern), sacrificing diary pages imposes escalating costs. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via symphony’s cadence shifts ("swelled" at portal) with conceptual cost (knowledge as living sacrifice) unmistakable on final page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "listening to silence between words" earned via diary-pedestal resonance, not stated. Final citadel image reweights "unheard symphony" as active discovery without moralizing. Zero thematic echo—insights arise from ferns’ names "resonating."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes under pressure: "parsed syllables like a surgeon" reflects linguist’s precision; rhythm accelerates ("floor gave way") then breathes ("soft wind carried scent"). Zero head-hopping; lexicon stays within POV (no corporate jargon during vine negotiation).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion flawless: "stone cathedral" opening anchors voice/stakes; zero synonym loops. Figurative language never muddles ("whispered name" motif builds to "silence into song"). Final line recharges symphony motif with crystalline clarity despite high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "library of unlearned lessons" transforms mystical library trope through linguistic stakes (blank scrolls requiring curiosity). Emotional truth in Selene’s quiet dedication avoids generic heroism. Specificity anchors universals: botanical diary’s "husks of ancient ferns" grounds the magical.</comment>
