<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority strong but "fiercely gentle" remains stated rather than embodied through conflicting actions; "bartered destinies" motivation drives choices well, though the epiphany about "shared renewal" edges toward abstraction without deeper moral ambiguity in the pact's cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "lone figure" and vague catacomb setting fail anchor test by 120 words, triggering -0.4 penalty; closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (ash→amber transformation), but felt stakes lack visceral weight at pivotal placement of the card in the hollow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (kneeling on vertebrae-root, cavity pulse guiding placement); roots stitching fissures directly charges the final image of "healed hopes," meeting 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation succeeds through sigil-carving and card dissolution deepening the "mend soul holes" stake; cost legibility falters—burden "lightening" is conceptual but lacks tangible sacrifice beyond the card's physical transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the amber thread reconfiguring "bartered destinies" as "stitches," avoiding moralizing; final image of orchard breathing "easier" offers resonant non-literal answer to renewal without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "susurrus that seemed to murmur the orchard’s own sorrow" filters setting through Maelia’s emotional state; rhythmic control sustains lyrical compression under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-duplicate scaffold in "feeling the chill of centuries seep into her skin" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise high density ("ash dissolved into a bright thread of amber" does triple duty) with no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of catacomb trope with soul-stitching mechanic avoids derivative safety; "bartered destinies for shards of hope" transforms familiar pact through visceral orchard logic, though emotional complexity lacks deeper moral friction.</comment>
