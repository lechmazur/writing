<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; motivation clear but untested. Passivity during discoveries lacks visible cost or earned change, reducing interiority to atmospheric vessel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density escalation, but protagonist passivity weakens causal weight. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost, though agency feels incidental rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains action: tapestry vibration leads to conduit discovery. "Bronze quiet" tone charges the final image where the library "breathes" with the world's pulse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite pattern accumulation. Zero friction in discoveries—no trade-offs, sacrifice, or personal cost for the historian despite the conceptual weight of "last human dream."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: "gentle turning toward a new horizon" crystallizes realignment as hope, earned through concrete particulars like humming walls and glyph pulses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("ash of centuries," "soot and old paper"). Rhythmic control modulates perfectly under pressure—from moth-like observation to mind-humming revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; minor scaffold in "breathing in the smell... feeling the page tremble" slightly dilutes momentum. Final line crystallizes theme without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via specific, non-catastrophic stakes (axis as realignment). "Bronze quiet" motif and silo-as-library synthesis feel inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
