<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; motivation remains abstract ("unravel cosmic illusions") with no visible cost to choices. Protagonist acts as passive conduit rather than agent under pressure, lacking micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing ("end of history was not a finality but a doorway") lacks legible cost—vanishing "like a breath of wind" feels consequence-free. Ambiguous Accumulative/Textural lens weakens escalation; disorientation serves theme but cost remains conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Temple library evokes vivid atmosphere but functions as static backdrop—no environmental constraint on choices (e.g., dictionary "translates with humming fidelity" without struggle). Micro-setting (dictionary) charges closure but fails to shape mid-scene tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("unravel cosmic illusions") declared early but pressure never tightens; zero obstacles or trade-offs. Protagonist remains passive ("began the ritual," "stepped onto the map") with no agency-driven escalation or tangible cost paid for resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic unity emerges organically through spiral imagery and "shattered mirrors" metaphor. Final image ("seamless horizon where past/present/future converge") reweights the premise without moralizing, though "doorway" phrasing flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone arches breathing a quiet rhythm") and rhythmic control elevate pressure, but "resounding hush" repetition creates tic-like loops. Purposeful elision taught early pays off in closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" paraphrase loop (3x in key beats) and "journeying inward" cadence rigidity dull immediacy. Beautiful texture but scaffolded phrases ("quiet paradox," "tangled narratives") reduce density; final image escapes artifact penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic scale and intimate ritual ("universe's hiccup"), yet emotional truth remains abstract. Bold lyric risk succeeds, but safety-hedging in flawless execution ("aching peace") limits vulnerability needed for 9+ distinction.</comment>
