<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s luminous skepticism manifests in concrete micro-choices (tracing symbols while doubting myths), with contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. doubt) driving her transformation. Her earned shift from skeptic to "keeper of light" carries visible cost in identity, though internal conflict could deepen slightly pre-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: geese departure crystallizes renewal with conceptual cost (Mara’s worldview shattered). Accumulative lens holds through breadcrumb density shifts; "sidereal patience" tightens tactics. Minor convenience in breadcrumb mechanics prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>City setting actively constrains choices (alleyways, empty basin) and charges closure (fountains humming anew). Sensory details like "petrichor and distant incense" serve urgency, though "whispering of ages lost" leans generic. Final box weight reweights prior burden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberating memories) escalates via Mara’s agency: box resistance ("hinges tightening") forces patience, with cost in her identity shift. "Sticking force" intensification narrows options, but physical struggle lacks visceral weight during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—memory liberation reweights skepticism into belief—without moralizing. Final constellation ("new constellations of hope") answers the central question through image, not assertion. Avoids thematic echo via embodied transformation ("steps echoing the city’s heart").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kaleidoscopic prayers," "river of forgotten lullabies") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in climax ("defiant hush" to "city exhaled"), with zero POV drift. Compression of geese’s pause taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-redundancy in "resonated with a defiant hush, as if the city held its breath" slightly dulls momentum. Otherwise pristine: high density ("spilling cascade of tiny lights"), no loops, and final line’s "newly awakened heart" avoids cliché. One scaffold phrase blocks 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mythic elements (geese as temporal keys) avoids tropes through specific logic. "Sticking force uncoil" brilliantly physicalizes patience; city’s renewal feels earned. Transformation test passed—generic "hero" would break emotional specificity.</comment>
