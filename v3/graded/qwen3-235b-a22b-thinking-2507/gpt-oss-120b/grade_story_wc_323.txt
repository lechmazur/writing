<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's "balancedly curious" trait manifests concretely in her nightly star-tracing and vessel-plottting, avoiding stock epiphanies. Interior contradiction (depth/sky tension) is embodied via the anchor link's physical pull, but lacks a high-stakes choice testing her limits within the constrained scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira's "somber promise" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("darkness filled with possibility"). Orientation anchors by line 3 ("dimly lit benthic city"), and Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to the final sonar hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The benthic city's micro-setting constrains choices (sonar arrays treating photons as nodes) and charges closure when the anchor link "catches the dim glow of alien script." Sensory details like "pressure-hardened basalt" serve urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Mira's agency plotting vectors and interpreting the anchor's physics, with felt cost in "mournful precision." But pressure lacks visceral narrowing—success feels inevitable rather than earned through meaningful tactical sacrifice under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the anchor link evolves from relic to "balance of forces" without moralizing. Final image reweights "unfolded horizons" as "reachable map," avoiding thematic echo while resonating with the somber-marvel tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("balancedly curious," "pulsed like low tide") persists under pressure. Psychic distance modulates perfectly from Mira's nightly observations to students' gathering, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density serves propulsion ("hull reflecting alien glyphs"). Figurative language avoids muddle: "anchor link’s weight shifted center of mass" concretely ties physics to thematic balance in the peak test-vessel beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms deep-sea tropes: "edge geometry" reshapes navigation logic, and the anchor link’s irreplaceable physics (weight shift enabling balance) avoids symbolic convenience. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
