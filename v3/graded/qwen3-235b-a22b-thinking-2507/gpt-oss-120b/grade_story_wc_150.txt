<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") with limited embodied contradiction; motivation clear but micro-choices lack concrete stakes during altar assembly. Final endurance earns closure but prior struggle feels generalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density (roots recoiling, bones rattling) toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "cautious calm" settling, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—completion feels inevitable rather than earned through narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard actively constrains choices (navigating roots/bones) and charges final image: bioluminescent roots guide hands, shadows align with root-veins. Micro-setting (sundial base) directly shapes tactics and closure’s "shared sunrise" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith) signaled early, but pressure accumulates without meaningful tightening—no live option foreclosed or trade-off. Cost felt in "cautious calm" but lacks visceral escalation; resolution hinges on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (rebuilding shards), not abstraction. Final image ("shared sunrise") reweights "interrupted journeys" as mended faith without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding hope in tactile restoration ("bright bands across tomb’s threshold").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots humming," "bones rattled") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift ("cautious enchantment") slightly dilutes voice, but compression (e.g., "purposeful wandering" motif) taught early and paid off in closure’s "shared sunrise."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Two paraphrase loops ("purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment") dull momentum; "pale rivers of memory" overwrites tension. Final paragraph’s "stitching fragmented faiths" risks sentimentality but avoids fatal artifacts. Propulsion strong except mid-scene reflection on grandparents.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of diaspora returnee + physical restoration (sundial base) avoids template tropes. Bioluminescent roots transform familiar catacomb setting, but premise lacks bold risk-taking; emotional specificity ("spirit steadied by cautious enchantment") elevates beyond generic hope.</comment>
