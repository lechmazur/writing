<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Abstract motivation ("spark of defiance") lacks embodied conflict; Lysander's internal struggle remains told not shown. Dr. Mirabel's abrupt shift to ally lacks micro-choices revealing value hierarchy. Diagnostic label-speak ("spark of defiance") triggers -0.5 deduction without dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (thoughts as untaxable), but orientation fails by 120 words: "where" remains vague (city/lab?) without payoff. Accumulative lens holds yet escalation lacks pressure—no narrowing of options, just atmospheric deepening. Cost feels asserted not anchored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities") but greenhouse never constrains choices. Gourd seed functions as micro-setting yet fails to charge final image—it's passive in closure ("sang its last reverberation") rather than shaping tactics. Misses 9+ gate for setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought taxation) signaled early, but pressure never escalates—Dr. Mirabel's shift to ally feels coincidental, not earned by Lysander's agency. No narrowing of options or visible cost; "battlefield of ideas" remains abstract without concrete test. Conceptual cost lands but lacks tactical reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "living cipher" imagery without moralizing. Final image ("gourd rattle seed sang...") reweights prior material as non-literal answer to rebellion's cost. But theme resolves into simplistic binary (rebellion vs. bureaucracy) lacking meaningful ambiguity—no character wrong without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("metronome of revolt," "husk crackle") with rhythmic control under pressure. But focalization breaks when Dr. Mirabel's realization ("realized the garden had become...") intrudes without clear POV boundary. Near-9+ but head-hopping costs final 0.4.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High density undermined by overwriting: "candidly cryptic verses" feels forced, paraphrase loops ("converging chaos" x2), and template cadence ("He whispered... He scattered..."). Final beat artifacts ("thriving chaos... spark safe") dull closure image, triggering -0.7 penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thought taxation via community gardens avoids cliché (seedling patterns as living cipher). But "charming rogue scholar" trope lacks transformation—no moral ambiguity or specific lived detail. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes yet closure feels slightly pat.</comment>
