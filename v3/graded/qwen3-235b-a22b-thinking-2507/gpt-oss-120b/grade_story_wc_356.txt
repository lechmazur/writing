<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract thematic labels ("cultivate serenity within motion") without embodied contradiction; no visible struggle against impatience undermines closure's earned endurance. "Diagnostic label-speak" in peak beats weakens micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as villagers breathe the hush, crystallizing motion/stillness duality—but cost remains abstract (implied patience) without concrete forfeiture. "Felt cost" lacks unmistakable on-page proof in pivotal bloom moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity anchors treetop setting, yet micro-setting (birch trunk, doodles) fails to constrain choices; recurring objects charge final image but lack causal pressure during growth. Environment doesn't alter tactics despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("patience for bloom") remain abstract with no narrowing of options or tangible cost paid; elders' warning introduces pressure but dissolves into passive waiting. Static escalation lacks meaningful deepening under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently through doodles and scents, but final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("serenity can be cultivated within motion") triggers -0.6 penalty. Earned wisdom is diluted by thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct scent-driven perceptual signature shines, yet "olfactorily sensitive" repetition and mixed metaphors ("tide's thought") create register drift. Overwritten lyricism dulls immediacy in bloom climax despite rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose loops ("wildflower hush" x4, synonym churn for serenity) and template cadence ("Lira moved... slipped... planted") accumulate in final third, dulling closure. Filter-verb stacks undermine sensory immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Doodling/wisdom synthesis feels fresh initially, but premise leans on patience-rewarded template without bold risk. Emotional specificity avoids genericity yet lacks transformative stakes to reach high bands.</comment>
