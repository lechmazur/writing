<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Mara’s transformation feels inevitable rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak, but emotions remain abstract ("grief lingered like rust") without embodied degradation during high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mara’s identity shift ("no longer merely an inspector") carries conceptual cost in the final image. Lens ambiguity early (Accumulative/Textural only solidifies by para 3) slightly undermines escalation coherence despite strong density build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystal caves actively constrain choices: quartz refracts light into "prisms that whispered," directly enabling the confession ritual, while the pool’s lavender shift charges the closure image. Micro-setting (seashell spiral) dictates confession mechanics with tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through confession absorption, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mara acts as conduit rather than driving pressure. The "crown" ritual forecloses her old role with visible cost, yet the tightening feels preordained, not earned through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through action (etching confessions), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "crown" conceptually without stating morals, though "resonant hush" refrain risks becoming thematic echo in later paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("trembling gleam," "heartbeat paused at hesitation") modulates effectively, but prose remains uniformly lyrical under stress without degradation. Register stays consistent, though "grief lingered like rust" verges on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Template cadence in confession sequence ("The first confession... With each confession...") creates synonym churn. Final paragraph’s "vowed to spread the method" tells rather than shows, dulling momentum despite otherwise vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Transforms doomsday tropes via "cultivated pearl" metaphor with emotional truth in the child’s confession. However, "latent radiance" concept leans on familiar magical realism templates without sufficiently fresh moral calculus.</comment>
