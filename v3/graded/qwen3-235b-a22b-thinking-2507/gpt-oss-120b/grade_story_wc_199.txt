<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("mossy delight" as label, not embodied contradiction); transformation occurs to Lira rather than emerging from struggle; diagnostic label-speak in "eyes reflecting mossy delight" triggers -0.5 penalty; no visible tradeoffs despite "steady rebirth" claim.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: luminous leaf script crystallizes options with undeniable cost (Lira's permanent transformation); Accumulative lens holds throughout; felt cost legible in "forest's gratitude" and "prophecy fulfilled"; single deepening (decoding "home"/water) sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashen arbor constrains choices (prodding moss reveals spring); micro-setting of twine monuments charges final image; "crystal pool reflecting ash-colored canopy" integrates setting with closure; minor cliché in "violet sky" prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding leaves) lacks meaningful opposition; protagonist agency is passive reception ("dust ignited, Lira felt"); no visible price paid for transformation; water discovery resolves without altering tactics; escalation remains decorative rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: monuments as "patient librarians," pact "between human care and forest memory"; avoids moralizing; "prophecy of renewal" earned through action; "moss-clad wonder" borders on thematic echo but stays subtextual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (botanical focus) with rhythmic control in opening; "mossy delight" recurs as tic under pressure; "ashen skyborne arbor" establishes voice but later phrases ("moonstone cabochon dust speck") disrupt lexicon; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops weaken climax: "leaves formed luminous script... letters glowed"; "miniature altars" → "tiny tower" → "central tower" repetition; strong opening rhythm degrades in final third; no figurative muddle but scaffold reduces density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-sorting mechanics with folklore; "twine monuments as librarians" transforms tropes; emotional specificity in "mossy delight" avoids generic wonder; lacks one non-obvious risk (e.g., contested transformation) for 9.0+.</comment>
