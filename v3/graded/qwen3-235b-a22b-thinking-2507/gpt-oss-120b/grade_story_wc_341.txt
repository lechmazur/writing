<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation lacks friction; "prove empty spaces remember" faces no internal conflict or tangible stakes, reducing endurance to passive observation without visible struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands weakly; "empty spaces remember" lacks felt cost—her smile at stitching light feels earned, not sacrificial, violating cost proof test for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dust-laden starlight and brass telescope charge the final image profoundly; the telescope’s inscriptions ("hope on the rim, grief on the lens") constrain her memorialization method and reconfigure the void’s meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>No escalation under Accumulative lens: cloud categorization remains static ritual without deepening pressure or narrowing options; "quietly explosive" comet offers revelation but no trade-off or altered tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment>Thematic resonance emerges through "spooled wholeness" reprise at closure, but "to prove that empty spaces remember" is stated outright in a peak beat, triggering thematic echo penalty that dulls earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lenses catching starlight like dust on an old photograph") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure’s comet imagery without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Adjacent paraphrase loops ("stitched together the spooled wholeness"/"looping back into a tapestry") and therapy-speak ("even absence can echo") in high-pressure beats undermine momentum; final line’s lyricism salvages closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and grief via cloud-emotion taxonomy feels inevitable, but "sky gondola as shrine" leans on familiar tropes without bold risk-taking that heightens stakes meaningfully.</comment>
