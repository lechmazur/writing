<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("texture she craved") without embodied contradiction; motivation lacks struggle against the "borrowed days" premise. Flawless execution fails as Mara's flawless progression shows no genuine struggle or conflicting impulses under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost (time's irreversible transformation), but causality breaks in clue discovery: "midnight tea" ad appears coincidentally without prior setup. Escalation lacks meaningful tightening as pressure never constricts Mara's options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emerald silo functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("surface rippling like liquid glass") and constrains choices through its antenna role. Sensory specificity ("minutes stretching like thin silk") avoids white-room syndrome while reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) is declared but never viscerally tested; no narrowing of options occurs as Mara smoothly decodes clues. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt through agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("grain of sand corresponding to human memory"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("tapestry she could walk through") offers resonant non-literal answer, though thematic complexity lacks meaningful ambiguity in the villagers' facile resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust-laden valley," "numbers changed meaning") with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. Minor register drift in climax ("palpable sense of minutes") avoids head-hopping while teaching the Accumulative pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but figurative muddle in climax ("air grew suddenly timeless... strands shimmering with stories") risks obscuring cause/effect. No loops, though "silver sand" constellations slightly overwrites the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time capsule tropes through "texture of time" concept and garage-sale ciphers. Emotional specificity avoids templates, though "borrowed-time" premise leans derivative without sufficient transformation of the timekeeper archetype.</comment>
