<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("shyly unstoppable") is labeled but not embodied in micro-choices; the poet's "relentless yearning" lacks visible struggle against humility during verse creation. Cost of photosynthesizing pain remains abstract despite "slow-growing coral" metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks when nebulae bloom, scattering starlight as "pollen" that coaxes the sea to pause—a Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (centuries of longing transformed). No orientation debt; time dilation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shell functions as micro-setting: its "cracks" enable the "off-key wind" that shapes lullabies, and "reef-shadow joy" glows charge the final image. Coral spire, sea-glass bottle, and postcard constrain the poet’s actions, directly enabling the blossom armistice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (converting ache into healing language) tightens when the postcard’s nebulae "burst into full bloom," forcing the poet’s realization that verses are "water" for cosmic seeds. Cost is conceptual: centuries of sorrow transmuted into generational hope, felt in the "dissolve[ed]" lullabies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "blossom armistice" reprise: the final image ("blooming eternally within the heart of the shell") answers the central question without moralizing. Pain-to-beauty alchemy avoids sentimentality via "vine seeking sun" and "wound he could mend" specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "moon painted silver veins on the walls" and "tasted of salt and lullaby"—distinct to the poet’s synesthetic lens. Rhythmic control sustains pressure through cadence shifts ("Centuries slipped by unnoticed..."), though "shyly unstoppable" lacks embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line propulsion falters in "hearts gathered each sorrow like a slow-growing coral" (overwritten metaphor); "photosynthesize pain into beauty" edges toward thematic echo. Yet final line’s "reef-shadow joy, blooming eternally" achieves crystalline density with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes cosmic grief and lyrical healing through "galaxy postcard as seed"—a non-obvious angle where nebulae become "petals." Risk-taking (time dilation, sentient reef) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "shyly unstoppable" verges on stock phrasing.</comment>
