<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; "chaotically precise" remains label-only without conflicting impulses in action. Diagnostic term "synaptic plasticity" intrudes without embodied struggle during tremor crisis. No visible flaw complicates choices beyond minor steadying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks concrete cost legibility; fading memories feel conceptual not visceral. Tremor escalation resolves too cleanly without altering tactics—no trade-off when Aria presses on. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof fails at dawn exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon anchors atmosphere vividly, but basalt/mirror shards don’t constrain choices—only decorative. Micro-setting (shards as neurons) charges final image yet lacks causal pressure during calibration. Strong specificity without tactical consequence caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving dreams) deepens through density, but tremor pressure doesn’t narrow options—Aria’s "steadying" avoids trade-offs. Cost remains abstract (fleeting memories) not felt; no visible price alters her gathering of shards. Agency-driven escalation lacks tangible consequence under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (unsung song, unfinished poem), avoiding moralizing. Final humming shards offer resonant answer to "abandoned dreams" without stating moral. Slight thematic echo risk in repeated "archeologist" phrasing but earns ambiguity through sensory particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("handwriting spiraling like DNA," circuitry wind) modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift with clinical "synaptic plasticity" in lyrical context. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in Aria’s sensory bias despite poetic compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synonym churn on "synaptic plasticity" (3x repetition) and "quaking reverie" creates density loops. Stacked metaphors ("liquid quartz" tools, "dormant dreams" wind) blur causality in setup. Final beat clean but earlier artifacts dull closure’s immediacy—text loops cap high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of geology/neuroscience ("mineral veins as brain tissue") avoids trope through specific periscope mirror. Emotional truth in cataloging "abandoned dreams" elevates familiar premise. Risk-taking (stone memory lattice) heightens stakes without gimmickry yet "entangled memories" feels derivative.</comment>
