<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("preserve wonder") is clear but static; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure beyond routine joint-tightening. Interiority remains observational ("discovers method," "coaxing iceberg") without dramatized struggle against fading. Key flaw: "simple yet fierce" motivation lacks escalation or visible cost despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (sculpture's "slow heartbeat refusing darkness") reweights stakes but cost remains abstract—"color of wonder" preservation lacks concrete on-page price. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density buildup, yet "cost proof test" fails: no specific image/line shows paid cost, only hopeful assertion ("promise that symphonies... never silenced").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting (copper joints, iceberg fragment) actively constrains choices: tightening joints daily charges the final glisten image. Bluff’s "shiver of stone" recording silence transforms environment into active participant. Final shadows "turning silence into visual chorus" perfectly charges closure with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) signaled early but pressure never escalates—wind’s "tempered vigor" and routine glisten-coaxing lack meaningful tightening. No narrowing of options or deepening; stakes remain abstract ("world will not lose wonder") without concrete test. Static conflict contradicts Accumulative lens demands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (iceberg’s hum as "fragment of symphonies"), avoiding moralizing. But "symphonies of truth" concept remains decorative abstraction, not integrated into tactics. Cross-cap applies: Q4≤6.9 caps Q5 at 7.2 despite resonant final image ("hope glistens") as escalation fails to charge theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature strong (tuner notices glisten, wind’s "cool hand"), but diction drifts into purple prose ("cradles a lone workshop," "symphonies of truth"). Overwriting in peak beats ("slow heartbeat refusing darkness") violates POV lexicon. Cross-cap applies: Q7≤7.0 caps Q6 at 7.6.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Severe figurative overload: "glisten" repeated 6x with near-identical phrasing ("glisten brighter," "glisten of ice"), creating synonym churn. Closure beat ("kinetic sculpture still moves, a slow heartbeat...") suffers template cadence and mixed metaphor. Artifact in final third disallows 9+ globally per Q7 rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art-as-resistance via kinetic ice sculpture, but "preserving wonder" trope lacks non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity (copper joints, rescued iceberg) elevates beyond cliché, yet "symphonies of truth" concept feels derivative. Bold risk in silence-as-instrument heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
