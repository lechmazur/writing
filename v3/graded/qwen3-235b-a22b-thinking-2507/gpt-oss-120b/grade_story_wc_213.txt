<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("favoring listening over noise") drives concrete actions like sensor calibration, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "hush deepen" embodies patience yet avoids deeper emotional friction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (retired rope secured in chest), causal lens holds through timer-driven progression, though "zero hour" slightly abstracts the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s wind pressure constrains sensor placement choices, and the bell rope’s evolution from "retired hymn" to secured artifact charges the final image; micro-setting shapes tactics decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (precision vs. clamor) tighten via the glue-drying timer, forcing protagonist’s agency; cost is tangible in the retired rope, but emotional weight remains understated during the bell’s activation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell’s transformation ("sang a low, steady tone"), avoiding moralizing; the final lullaby reweights "listening over noise" as a resonant, non-literal answer without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pulse of the sky," "breath of the clouds") modulates under stress; rhythmic control in high-pressure beats (e.g., timer countdown) avoids uniformity or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "humming veil" metaphor coheres with microclimate logic. Final line ("carrying the story to ears yet untrained") charges closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific precision and spiritual listening transforms the bell-ringer trope; emotional specificity avoids genericity, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety.</comment>
