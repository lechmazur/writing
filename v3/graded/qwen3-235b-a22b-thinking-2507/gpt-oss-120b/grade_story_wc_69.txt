<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses ("expectantly resigned" vs "quiet thrill") but townspeople lack individuation beyond "burden of old grudges." Teacher's embodied choices under pressure (coaxing first chord amid tension) earn credibility, yet veteran/child arrive too late for meaningful development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "the journey was not a single performance but a continuous process" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost of perpetual unlearning. Accumulative lens holds cleanly, though escalation lacks sufficient resistance—the hatred "rusting away" feels under-earned despite the teacher’s methodical noise subtraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Velvet library functions as active micro-setting: curtains "absorbing bitter echoes" and ambience "breathing with them" constrain choices and charge closure. Autumn wind evolves causally from rattling shutters to carrying the choir’s echo, perfectly reweighting the vanishing arts theme through environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via "subtracting noise" method narrowing options—silence becomes a "canvas" for new voices. Agency is clear in the teacher’s choices, but external conflict resolution feels too facile; townspeople’s transformation lacks visceral struggle against "iron chains" of hatred, muting the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the rosette’s evolution from "captured sunrise" to "glowing brighter" with reconciliation. Final image of wind carrying "faint echo of the choir" offers resonant answer to vanishing arts without moralizing, though "blossomed anew within every heart" skirts sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature favors sound/touch ("shelves smelled of old paper," "silence between notes") with rhythmic compression during tension ("She inhaled, feeling the weight settle like dust"). Single-POV control flawless, though "denoted a new beginning" drifts into abstract diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high density ("zither’s rosette glowed brighter with each passing phrase" does triple duty), but "traveled stillness" repetition creates a minor scaffold. Final line’s slight sentimentality ("blossomed anew within every heart") avoids purple prose through concrete antecedents.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "healing through art" trope via specific mechanics: rosette petals as reclaimable notes, "subtracting noise" as tangible method. Emotional truth in the teacher’s quiet endurance ("expectantly resigned yet hopeful") avoids cliché, though the townspeople’s rapid shift risks generic resolution.</comment>
