<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("nervously confident") embodied through physical details like "trembling fingertips" and "spongey dread settling into resolve"; micro-choices (sealing nail in concrete) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost during vortex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("spongey dread settle into resolve" foreclosing flight), but storm escalation feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens; jet stream shift lacks causal linkage to Mara's actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Weather station micro-setting actively constrains choices (ladder descent to chamber, concrete embedding during storm); copper nail's "captured heartbeat" glint charges final image while altering tactics when alarms blare.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting nail as moral compass) tightens via vortex threat, but escalation relies on external storm rather than protagonist agency; cost ("dread into resolve") legible though pressure lacks Mara-driven deepening of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("spongey dread lingered... reminder that world needed librarians who could map bravery") offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing; theme emerges through concrete actions (sealing nail, writing stanzas) not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("syllable press against spine like damp moss") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control strong though "reversible exile" repetition slightly disrupts consistency in climax beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("spongey dread" x3) and template cadence ("She descended... each step echoed") in mid-section; high density maintained but "nervously confident" label weakens specificity during pivotal retrieval moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and ancestral haunting transforms "reversible exile" through concrete stakes (embedding nail in concrete); risk-taking in Accumulative lens pays off via charged final image without gimmickry.</comment>
