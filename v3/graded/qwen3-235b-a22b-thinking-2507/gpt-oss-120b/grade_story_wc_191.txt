<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation but interior contradiction absent; "wisely adventurous" remains labeled trait without embodied conflict. Final choice lacks visible cost—throne acceptance feels effortless despite "weight of histories" abstraction. No secondary character to test relationships.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density toward Earned Stasis. Sunrise deadline tightens stakes, but causality falters—mural "shivers" to reveal stairway feels convenient, not earned. Cost legibility weak; "weight lifted" lacks concrete on-page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: orchard bark layers constrain Mina’s search tactics, and the ruby flake’s light merges with stairway to charge the final image. Sensory details ("fermented jasmine and silicon") filter through lore keeper’s bias, avoiding tourist catalog. Environment actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim throne before sunrise) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Mina follows sigils passively. Sunrise deadline creates urgency, yet cost remains conceptual ("balance") without visceral felt price. Pressure tightens via sensory density, but no meaningful trade-off alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through stairway as "bridge between memory and possibility," charged by placing the second ruby flake for balance. Avoids moralizing, though "guide countless seekers" risks thematic echo. Final image reweights nostalgia as active stewardship without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silicon scent," "holographic dew") but filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Rhythm varies well except repetitive "She sallyed... She commenced..." Cadence shifts effectively during ascent, though lexicon drifts into abstraction near closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in peak beats: "forge a bridge of fire" clashes with digital motifs ("pixelated rain," "data trees"). Template cadence in action sequences ("She sallyed... She commenced..."). Final line’s "circuitry across the horizon" feels clichéd. No loops in closure beat, but density issues dim momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh cyber-fantasy synthesis (neon archives + kaleidoscopic waterfall), but "hidden orchard" and "stairway of ascension" lean tropey. Transformation test passed: removing ruby flake breaks logic. Risk-taking elevates stakes—data trees bloom as she ascends—though sunrise deadline feels overused.</comment>
