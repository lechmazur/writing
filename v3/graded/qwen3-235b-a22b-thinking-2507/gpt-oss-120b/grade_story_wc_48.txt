<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior conflict remains observational ("doubt gnawed") without contradictory impulses in action; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation despite strong embodied detail like "pen moving as if guided by an invisible hand." Diagnostic label "conflicted" isn't dramatized through trade-offs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise works ("she would always swim against it"), but cost legibility falters—"weight of each hope settle into paper" feels abstract versus tangible forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds with density increase in cameo collection, yet final cost lacks pinpointable on-page anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: seashell fragment constrains choice by guiding ink "like a compass" at climax, charging the final image. Mist evolves from "soft humming veil" to "curling like applause," actively shaping tactics ("moving through mist like a shadow"). Meets 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when narrative current "tried to pull her words away" forcing endurance with felt cost (doubt persisting post-completion). Agency shines in "moving against current," but secondary pressure lacks depth—doubt remains internal without external constraint escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "mosaic built against current" and "bridge connecting hopes," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("light a new horizon") reweights prior material non-literally, though "shapes of yearning" verge on abstraction without deeper complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("flicker of light that slipped through the veil like a secret invitation") with rhythmic control, but "lucidly watchful" recurs 4x as a tic under pressure. Voice modulates effectively though syntactic monotony appears in closure beats ("She knew... She sensed...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose loops ("each step measured, each breath a promise") and template cadence in climax ("She placed... She felt... She solemnize") dull immediacy. Seashell's "quiet song" metaphor strains coherence, though final line's reprise ("compass toward unseen stories") redeems density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of writing-as-hope-collection via seashell compass, avoiding cliché with "feral nexus" specificity. Emotional truth in "doubt gnawed" elevates tropes, but "swimming against current" lacks bold risk-taking beyond established metaphor.</comment>
