<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's embodied emotion ("dust-touched charts," "cautiously hopeful surge") grounds her motivation, but cosmic tricksters lack concrete pressure. Contradictory impulses in her interference method elevate interiority, though abstract antagonists weaken stakes escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when the campus hums the subsonic chord—conceptual cost crystallized in "power plays lose their edge." Orientation anchors by word 15 ("old university radio station"), but repetitive "cautiously hopeful" phrasing slightly dulls the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The radio station constrains every choice (subsonic balance, broadcast layers), charging the finale where "ethereal grit" becomes the valley's chorus. "Dust-touched astronomical charts" and "refrigerator’s hum" exemplify micro-setting specificity that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s interference escalating cosmic tricksters’ threat into a false solar flare alarm. Cost feels earned as community anxiety dissolves, though the tricksters’ defeat lacks visceral struggle, muting escalation’s weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "power plays lose their edge when all ears listen as one" avoids moralizing. The final valley chorus reweights division into unity through concrete action, not abstraction, fulfilling Q5’s 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice shows distinct perceptual texture ("restless static, a canvas for celestial signal"), but "cautiously hopeful" recurs like a tic. Lyrical compression teaches its pattern early, though minor register drift occurs in "cosmic tricksters" mythologizing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density shines in "collective breath of a campus learning to listen," but synonym loops ("cautiously hopeful" x3) and mixed metaphor ("lighthouse... casting ethereal grit") dilute peak beats. Final image remains clear despite minor scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms radio tropes via acoustic specificity (subsonic frequencies, fridge hums). The valley chorus resolution feels inevitable yet fresh, synthesizing cosmic stakes with communal action without gimmickry—Q8’s risk distinction fully earned.</comment>
