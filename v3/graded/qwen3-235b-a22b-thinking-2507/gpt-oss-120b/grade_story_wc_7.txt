<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but "informally wise" remains labeled not demonstrated; Mara's internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Diagnostic "synaptic plasticity" phrasing breaks character-bound knowledge during crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with rust-to-ruby transformation showing cost, but celestial alignment resolution leans on coincidence rather than earned causality under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse constrains every choice: solar-panel fire, rust veins during climax, vines responding to hum. Final amber glow charges closure through environment. Sensory details filtered through chef's palate avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("create beauty from ruins") signaled early but lacks concrete opposition; vines cooperate instantly without struggle. Celestial alignment tightens time pressure but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on-page during key choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Gentle rebellion" theme emerges organically through pruning imagery and spore release, avoiding moralizing. Final humming garden offers non-literal answer to renewal question, though "sow hope" whisper edges toward thematic echo in closing lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("taste memories," broth as conduit) persists under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early; no head-hopping. Lexicon stays chef-specific ("savor and catalog," "spices") avoiding academic drift during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density in "vines responded to rising hum, unfurling leaves that seemed to pulse." But "synaptic pathways of plants’ nervous filaments" introduces clinical diction jarring with lyrical voice during critical seed-planting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of culinary memory-tasting with neural botany feels inevitable. Bold risk in making rebellion a pruning act rather than war, charging closure through "soft applause" of falling leaves. Avoids derivative post-apocalyptic tropes via sensory specificity.</comment>
