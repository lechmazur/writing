<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifism and motivation lack concrete contradiction; "senselessly perceptive" trait is stated but never tested in action under pressure, reducing interiority to abstract labels without embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>No causal escalation or pressure narrowing options; the "tranquil blaze" refrain loops without deepening stakes, and closure lacks felt cost—Earned Stasis fails as no path is foreclosed with visible sacrifice beyond gentle reinforcement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the dome’s atmosphere, but the desert roses and sandbag scrap function as ornamental symbols rather than constraining choices; the glass setting doesn’t pressure tactics despite lyrical description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("weaving continuity") with no tangible opposition or escalation; the boy’s compass moment resolves too easily, avoiding meaningful trade-offs, and the dominant stake faces no on-page test that alters Lira’s tactics or costs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated ("burden can become a bridge") rather than emerging from concrete action; the final "silent vow" sermonizes, violating organic resonance with prompt-like moralizing that replaces earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent poetic voice with strong perceptual signature (tremors, thorns), but rhythmic monotony in repetitive "tranquil blaze" refrains dulls pressure modulation during key beats like the boy’s compass resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops ("stitching hope," "weaving continuity") and stacked metaphors ("calm fire ignite," "amber fire") obscure momentum; filter-verb clusters ("she felt," "she noticed") in high-pressure moments dull immediacy without pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pacific post-apocalyptic setting offers fresh texture, but the "peaceful warrior" trope lacks bold transformation; risk-taking in lyric structure is undermined by derivative resolutions (rose petal as compass) that avoid authentic struggle.</comment>
