<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between Mara's physical survival and emotional silence manifests in embodied choices (cradling the case, activating the device); micro-choices like pressing the fork to her palm reveal hierarchy of values with cost ("smoothing jagged memory into calm line").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the conservatory "exhales" with silence turned to song; cost legible in "each vibration smoothing jagged memory" under Accumulative/Textural lens held since midpoint ("willingness to hear quiet places").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tuning fork case functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (device activation) and charges final image ("case... rested like a heart"); "rose veins" on glass evolve causally with emotional heat, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency as heat-mapping deepens emotional stakes ("crimson for fear, azure for longing"), narrowing options to vulnerability with visible cost in "smoothing jagged memory into calm line".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("tune of the survivor's fork lingered") offers resonant answer to central question without moralizing; theme emerges from particulars like "weaving storms into tapestry of sound" avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skin remembered from the ship's galley fire") and rhythmic control under pressure; cadence shifts from fragmented activation beats to flowing resonance without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "crimson for fear, azure for longing" serves multiple functions; final beat ("tune... lingered") maintains clarity while charging closure with poetic compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery through scientific precision ("heat-mapping device") avoids tropes; risk-taking with quiet closure heightens stakes via "unshaken marvels" reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
