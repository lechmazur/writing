<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority ("dust settle on shoulders") but lacks contradictory impulses; final endurance is earned yet internal conflict remains observational rather than active under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("weathered resolve settle into her marrow"); Accumulative/Textural lens held perfectly through density increase in echo/bird patterns to crystallize stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stone arrowhead (tool) constrains choices and charges final image; "dust on shoulders" cliché slightly dilutes otherwise vivid sensory specificity woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via textural density (bird spirals/arrowhead resonance) reweights navigation stakes; cost legible but agency remains observational, limiting pressure’s causal drive under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Final image ("invisible lattice lingered") offers non-literal answer to "navigate without moving" through accumulated particulars, avoiding moralizing while charging conceptual cost of stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (vibration-focused noticing) modulates rhythm under pressure; "weathered resolve" borders on label but voice remains consistent and purposefully compressed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor overwriting ("pulse left wandering between shadow and stone" strains metaphor); otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops, though one cliché ("dust on shoulders") dulls closure’s edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation/echo concepts through specific sensory logic; risk-taking in passive protagonist heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "pulse" concept edges toward familiarity.</comment>
