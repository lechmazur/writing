<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("regret, ambition, echo of decisions") without embodied contradiction; pivotal acceptance of fractured selves lacks micro-choices showing competing impulses. Final endurance earns cost ("carry weight of fractured selves") but diagnostic phrasing ("process was not linear") weakens specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density builds through recurring light/rain motifs toward Charged Poise closure where tablet dissolution reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("every ending is merely a drop"). Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in "carry weight of all fractured selves" and rain imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Viaduct’s rainwater functions as micro-setting: phosphorescent droplets constrain choices (algorithm responds to glow) and charge closure (rain "dripped from consciousness"). Sensory hierarchy fits urgency—crisis narrows to heartbeat/ripple—but occupational detail irrelevant at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("conquer labyrinth of self") signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; pressure grows via environmental shifts ("fractured timelines widening") not character choices. Cost ("carry weight") legible but not visibly shaped by prior decisions, limiting high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "rain that dripped from consciousness" reweights "slick with reflected sky" without moralizing. Final lesson ("own every timeline") resonates via image, not assertion—but "periodically eternal" concept remains underexplored as constraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "stones slick with reflected sky" filters world through gravity-defier’s physics-bent POV. Rhythmic control under pressure ("between drop and ripple of his breath") avoids head-hopping; elision of backstory taught early via "memory served as waypoint."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Near-paraphrase loop in climax ("darkening brightness... somber sunrise, the darkening brightness") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Otherwise strong propulsion: "tablet dissolved into particles of light" avoids thematic echo through concrete image. No metaphoric muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes familiar "labyrinth of self" trope with procedural generation metaphor, but "fractured timelines" feels derivative. Fresh inflection: gravity-defiance reimagined as emotional weight ("fell upward... becoming periodically eternal"). Lacks non-obvious angle for 9+ band.</comment>
