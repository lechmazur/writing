<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to nurture wonder is embodied in micro-choices like adjusting harp tempo to breath, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the generational cost feels distant rather than viscerally paid on-page during her climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise where the saplings' shift toward light crystallizes hope's cost, but escalation relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven pressure narrowing options under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The oak roots' "humming" and locket's warmth function as micro-setting that constrains Liora's ritual and charges the final image of saplings shifting—a perfect 9+ gate fulfillment where environment shapes the generational cycle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes in linking wonder to ordinary magic deepen through the eclipse's approach, but the cost remains conceptual (generational shift) rather than a felt trade-off on Liora's part; pressure accumulates without narrowing her tactical choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the curl's reprise in newborns, offering a resonant non-literal answer to "ordinary magic" without moralizing; the final image of Liora watching with "cautious exuberance" reweights prior material with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "roots seemed to dream," but monolithic poetic diction flattens voice under pressure—no differentiation in how villagers or children would articulate awe, violating multi-POV potential in Track C.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density propel the prose, yet "cautious exuberance" recurs with near-synonym phrasing ("mixture of awe," "trembling smiles"), creating subtle scaffold in peak beats that prevents 9+ despite lyrical control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms eclipse tropes through the adaptive harp and generational curl motif; the risk of Accumulative/Textural structure pays off with emotional specificity in "tap rhythms on walking sticks," avoiding abstract everywhere-ness.</comment>
