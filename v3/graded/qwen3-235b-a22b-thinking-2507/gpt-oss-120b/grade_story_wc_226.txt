<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (paint-smeared fingers, heart beating to verses) but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Mara's "defiance" softens without struggle, and the cost of forgiveness remains abstract "dust," not embodied trade-offs. Flaws don't compound choices—her mischievousness has no consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("acceptance of loss"), but causality breaks: the ritual's resolution hinges on refracted echoes coincidentally transforming the spire, not Mara's agency. Lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet density lacks payoff—the "price" feels asserted, not earned through narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bone towers and spire create vivid atmosphere, but function as postcard backdrop—echoes refract light yet never constrain Mara's choices (e.g., no physical barrier to painting). Final spire-glow charges closure, but environment doesn't alter tactics; micro-setting (brush) lacks causal role beyond decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("price of forgiveness") are signaled early, but escalation is textural, not causal: poetry sessions deepen mood without narrowing options. Cost ("shared memory") is felt but not visible—townsfolk instantly "feel weight lift" with no sacrifice. Mara's agency is passive; coincidence (echoes refracting) resolves tension, violating lens guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through refracted echoes and "We are the echo," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights loss as acceptance without stating a moral, though "price of forgiveness" phrasing borders on thematic echo in mid-beats. Subtext in gestures (Lio's cracked voice) earns resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct ("canyon rose like a wounded beast"), with perceptual bias toward light/refraction. But rhythm lacks modulation under pressure—lyrical cadence remains uniform during ritual climax, missing compression for urgency. Dialogue is sparse but natural; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful imagery ("shards of secret confession"), but "refracted" repeats 8x, risking synonym churn in high-pressure beats. No scaffold loops, though final lines ("beacon for all who dared to repent") edge toward sentimentality. Opening anchors voice effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of forgiveness via art/echoes avoids tropes, with bone towers feeling original. Emotional truth in "shared memory" elevates, but core premise ("price of forgiveness") is familiar; specificity (chalk sketches, bone-whispers) prevents derivativeness. Risk in poetic structure pays off coherently.</comment>
