<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is vividly embodied ("furiously tranquil," rough bark texture) and her choice to surrender the cap earns closure, but contradictory impulses lack depth—motivation remains abstractly mythic without personal flaw-driven tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the vanished cap triggers the phoenix's transformation and Mira's seed planting, with visible cost in the cap's absence and atrium's thaw; causality falters slightly as "decreasing entropy" remains conceptual rather than dramatized action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The copper basin and oak cap function as micro-setting that constrains choice (anchoring the vortex) and charges the final image (planting the seed in frost-kissed earth), though "frozen cathedral" verges on generic symbolism without sufficient tactile novelty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully as the vortex tightens Mira's options (surrendering the cap to merge lineage with phoenix fire), but the dominant conflict remains ethereal—pressure accumulates texturally yet lacks visceral, character-specific consequences beyond the abstract "vanishing" cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Mira's tactile realization that time is "a texture" she weaves into soil, with the final seed-planting offering resonant non-literal closure; avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in sensory action rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in Mira's focus on textures ("sap between bark and wind"), but elevated diction ("vortex inheritance") occasionally clashes with her seed-saver lexicon during high-pressure beats, slightly undermining voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves rhythmic control with varied syntax ("She lifted... placed it"), but high-pressure vortex scenes risk overwriting—"shards of time like crystal snowflakes" creates mild metaphorical muddle that dilutes causal clarity in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenuity transforms tropes through hyper-specific synthesis (frost-feathered phoenix, entropy as cultivation), with the seed/time texture conceit feeling inevitable; risks lyrical abstraction but earns cohesion through relentless sensory grounding in closure.</comment>
