<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "purposefully curious" trait remains abstract label without flawed decisions under pressure. Strength in embodied details like "hair tangled like ancient vines" but no genuine struggle complicates choices—success feels unearned as she unlocks the covenant effortlessly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with visible cost in "hedges healed, their scars fading as new growth surged," but escalation falters—maze parts instantly with zero resistance, violating Accumulative lens demand for density increase. No meaningful tightening of options weakens pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("scent of rain-kissed pine," "cool weight of centuries") anchors atmosphere, but setting fails 9+ gate: cobalt glade exerts no tactical constraint—no thorns, spatial obstacles, or resource limitations pressure choices. Micro-setting potential of scars motif underutilized until final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking covenant) lacks escalation—zero obstacles test commitment; "anxious elation" named but not dramatized through conflicting actions. Cost ("scars fading") is legible yet inert, failing Band guardrail for 8.0+: no live option foreclosed or trade-off enacted during pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme ("dreams dictate destiny") emerges organically through beacon imagery and healed hedges, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights prior material with "merging of past wounds and future hope," but lacks meaningful ambiguity—resolution feels tidily symmetrical without grappling with thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air hummed with unspoken promises") and rhythmic control shine, but "purposefully curious" tells rather than shows. Strength in "Time folded, and the cobalt glade seemed to inhale" compression, though "anxious elation" label disrupts embodied voice under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Template cadence ("She recalled... She understood... She reached") triggers −0.4 loop penalty; "luminous threads of hope" verges on cliché. Strength in "cool weight of centuries pressing into fingertips," but synonym churn ("anxious elation rose... rose to a roar") dulls closure beat momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh inflection in "linking through scars as emotional mapping" elevates trope, yet core premise (visionary finds magic object) echoes common fantasy templates without sufficient transformation. Emotional truth in "merging wounds and hope" avoids safety middle but lacks risk-taking depth for higher band.</comment>
