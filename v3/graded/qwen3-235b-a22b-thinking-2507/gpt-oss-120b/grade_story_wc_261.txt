<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("closure seeker") clear but epiphany feels unearned; lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal coffee-ring alignment. Interiority strong in sensory details but diagnostic label-speak ("one who habitually opened wounds") weakens peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: sunrise revelation reweights time as "a wound we could read" with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout; "meteor hush" motif evolves meaningfully to final "radiance." Orientation clear by 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coffee rings function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges final image ("cratered edge mirrored scar curvature"). Hourglass and moss actively shape tactics—no ornamental details. Final light "bathing the scar" proves environment charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scar stories) lacks escalation; tunnel descent and ritual feel unchallenged. Plant guidance resolves conflict passively without cost until closure. Agency weakens Q4 despite strong conceptual cost in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through coffee-ring/scars mirroring; avoids moralizing. Final line reweights premise ("time itself was a wound") without abstraction. No thematic echo—insights earned via concrete particulars like "child whose arm broken by falling star."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chlorinated air taste," "moss rustling like meteors") persists under pressure. Rhythm modulates perfectly: short clauses during tension ("I paused"), lyrical flow at resolution. Zero head-hopping; telepathy filtered through "projecting images."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("frosted hourglass" described twice as "clouded"/"winter trapped") but high density otherwise. Final line’s "meteor hush radiance" crystallizes motif without muddle. No closure-tainting artifacts; propulsion maintained through sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Transforms "reading scars" trope via coffee-ring method; "displaced miracle" redefined as narrative integration. Emotional specificity in "map of pain" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking with telepathic plants pays off thematically but tower setting slightly generic.</comment>
