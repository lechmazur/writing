<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Rook's shift from body-finder to connection-keeper, but "heart thumped" lacks embodied specificity. Micro-choice when barking shifts the prism reveals value hierarchy with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as Rook seals the leaf with "I will carry these voices," foreclosing personal closure for communal purpose. Minor causality slip: cylinder's "final line" appears convenient without earned resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scrapyard actively constrains choices: metallic dust "sang under his weight" during trot, and wax preservation only makes sense in this environment. Final "tapestry stitched from whispered myths" charges closure with micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stake ("translate distance into closeness") deepens when leaf's hum makes memories "palpable," but lacks meaningful opposition. Escalation feels passive as cylinder/leaf readily yield secrets without protagonist-driven resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through leaf's function, not moralizing. Final image ("waxed leaf would guide them") reweights "distance into closeness" without stating morals. Near-sentimentality in "stitching the broken world" prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Rook filters world through scent ("muzzle dusted with ash"). Rhythmic control peaks in "veins glinting like veins of copper." Slight anthropomorphism in "riddle humming" barely mars consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero closure-impacting artifacts. Minor synonym loop: "tinting the revelations with violet hues" / "each hue a story." High density throughout, though "copper veins" repetition slightly dilutes propulsion in payoff beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes via bloodhound POV and "tinted revelations" mechanic. "Waxed leaf as compass" feels inevitable in hindsight. Generic "resource war" setting prevents higher synthesis.</comment>
