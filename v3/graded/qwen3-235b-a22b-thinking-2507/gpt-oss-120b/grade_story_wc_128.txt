<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract ("cautious exuberance surge" repeated without embodied contradiction); Mara's cargo expertise never informs her actions despite stated profession, weakening causal motivation for her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: locket's "quiet shine" reweights compassion's cost through the final image, but the symphony-to-library transition lacks causal linkage, creating minor orientation drift in the opening shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the locket constrains choices (pocketing it, balcony placement) and charges the final image with wind-carried shine, embodying the theme without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure (misdelivery → shared grief → community ceremony), but the fishermen's sardine gift arrives as off-stage convenience rather than earned consequence of Mara's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the Compassion Register ledger; "cycles of compassion" gains conceptual weight via the locket's journey, avoiding moralizing despite near-miss in the final negotiation line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whimsically attentive to flicker of curiosity" and cargo-led metaphors, but "cautious exuberance" becomes a repetitive tic rather than evolving with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose soars in atmospheric moments ("constellations twinkled like lanterns"), but "cautious exuberance" scaffold loops in high-pressure beats (climax) dull immediacy despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "misdelivered letter" trope through cargo-broker lens and locket-as-cargo conceit; specificity of "Compassion Register" ledger elevates beyond sentimental template.</comment>
