<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'") but hitchhiker's return lacks embodied cost; micro-choices under pressure (fiddle as compass) feel earned though emotional calibration edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of the moment settle like ash") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by line 3; pixelated amnesty activation lacks causal logic but patterned elision pays off in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wet-plate glass constrains choice (exposure timing) and charges closure ("pixel by pixel, as if granted amnesty"); sensory detail ("amber light onto the valley") filters through fiddler's observational bias with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via "ridge summit" deadline but pixelated amnesty mechanics remain abstract; "heart hammered with luminous disbelief" provides felt cost though agency in resolution leans coincidental (music triggering amnesty lacks established rules).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (wet-plate capturing hitchhiker) avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "never" through "pixel of grace" though "sculpt possibility" phrasing risks thematic echo in closing beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind traces invisible letters") modulates rhythm under pressure; non-standard cadence ("photograph developing in the dark") taught early pays off in closure; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "trembling map" metaphor accumulates meaning without muddle; minor overwriting ("luminous disbelief" repetition) avoided cost in closure beat though "muted squares" phrasing edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wet-plate photography with digital forgiveness transforms "pixelated amnesty" trope; risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry as scaffold map evolves from "fluttering" to "fireflies" with emotional truth.</comment>
