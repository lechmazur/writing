<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("spin prophecy into raw possibility") is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible struggle; final choice lacks causal groundwork. Diagnostic label-speak ("quietly inspired," "shared wisdom") undermines embodied emotion, with no flaws complicating choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise as Mara steps onto the sand bridge) reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—cataloging buttons is procedural, not driven by protagonist agency. No narrowing of options or visible price paid during pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("amber glow," "echo vibration") anchor atmosphere, but setting remains ornamental—warehouse/cliffs don’t constrain choices or charge the final image. Micro-setting (buttons, jar) functions as plot device without altering tactics, failing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unscrambling prophecy to reverse time) is abstract with no visceral cost or coherent pressure buildup. Cataloging buttons lacks escalation—no trade-offs, narrowing options, or protagonist-driven deepening. Resolution feels mechanical, not earned through altered stance or visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button/echo motifs but collapses into explicit moralizing: "shared wisdom was not a static lesson but a living conversation" directly states the thesis. Final-paragraph thematic echo ("world begins to rewrite") triggers -0.8 penalty, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("hands measured moments as carefully as a surgeon") and rhythmic control, but interiority lacks emotional degradation under stress—Mara remains calmly "inspired" throughout crisis. Cross-cap from Q7 line-level debt limits high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose suffers from overwriting: figurative language saturates high-pressure beats ("echo gathered the grains like memory"), with template cadence ("Mara believed... Mara set...") in the climax. Final-third synonym churn ("quietly inspired anew") triggers -0.7 penalty, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Concept (canyon echo solving prophecy) shows fresh inflection, but execution relies on abstract magical realism tropes without character-specific grounding. Core premise ("shared wisdom unscrambles time") lacks verifiable detail, failing transformation test—plot would work unchanged with different symbols.</comment>
