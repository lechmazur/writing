<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation ("to forgive the unfinished") is clear but lacks contradictory impulses; her choice to wield art as "balm not blade" feels unearned without prior struggle against weaponization. "True art must endure wisely" is diagnostic label-speak that triggers penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with Liora's vow, but cost remains abstract ("weight lift" without tangible consequence). Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) weakens escalation; the drip rhythm tightens pressure but key mechanics feel retroactively convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marble sanctuary functions as micro-setting: water drips constrain timing of ink resonance, charging the final image. However, "aurora" and "pearl twilight" remain decorative; stakes aren't pressured by environment beyond sensory atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forgiveness vs. treason) tightens when Liora chooses "balm," but cost is conceptual not visceral. Escalation lacks agency-driven deepening; the drip rhythm accumulates pressure yet feels detached from her internal choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink/water resonance but final whisper ("unlink shackles...") borders on thematic echo. "Calibrated treason" concept reweights forgiveness without stating morals, though "wisely enduring calm" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("inked spirals on cold stone") and rhythmic control under pressure excel. However, "calibrated treason" phrasing drifts into academic register, clashing with lyrical voice during pivotal key-reveal moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "calibrated treason against the pure lineage of calligraphy, a subtle rebellion inked in blood" strains metaphor coherence. Template cadence ("each night... each stroke... each line") dulls immediacy near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy forgery as political resistance feels specific, but "heritage rose thorn" trope lacks transformation. Emotional truth in unfinished-scroll motif elevates beyond generic lyricism, though aurora setting leans derivative.</comment>
