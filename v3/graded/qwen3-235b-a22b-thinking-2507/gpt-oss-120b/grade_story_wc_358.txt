<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses ("scientific and poetic") but "hazy precision" borders on label-speak; micro-choices lack visible cost escalation beyond data recording.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("weight of responsibility settle like a balanced scale"), but the wind release via whisper feels coincidental rather than earned by Accumulative/Textural lens pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choice as micro-setting: canyon streets channel wind, tarp becomes map surface, and rusted steel catches voice—environment directly charges the final image of "shadows stretching like hopeful fingers."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through wind pattern accumulation, but Mara's passive role ("began to cultivate foresight") undermines agency; cost remains conceptual rather than visceral despite "balanced scale" metaphor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of guided foresight emerges through concrete particulars (patch, anemometer), but final "measured, understood, guided" summary edges toward thematic echo without sufficient subtextual friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gusts that curled like ghosts") reflects Mara's aerial background, though "hazy precision" repetition slightly blurs voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Red needle trembling like a nervous heart" introduces cliché in high-pressure beat; otherwise, lyrical density ("tapestry of future movement") avoids scaffold with purposeful rhythm shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorological investigation and poetic resonance, though "singular convergence" risks generic conceptual framing without deeper transformation of the accident investigator trope.</comment>
