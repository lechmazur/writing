<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fingertips tingling as field wrapped... like lover's sigh" amid fear of fracturing lattice. Flawed avoidance of finality drives credible endurance, but minimal struggle before awe dilutes cost. Final renunciation of boredom earns closure with felt dissolution of emptiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: "whispered goodbye to former emptiness" with visible cost in amulet dissolving into dust. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—spatial mutiny's density shift (rooms→luminous tunnel) reweights "goodbye" as transition. Orientation crystal-clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains choices—rippling walls enable spatial shifts, final "multicolored light" charges closure as "sigh of relief." Micro-setting (amulet fragment) alters tactics when pressed against magnetic seam. Sensory hierarchy flawless: ozone scent anchors solar storm pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (boredom vs. curiosity) tightens through spatial mutiny's pressure—corridors coalesce into tunnel via protagonist's choice to press amulet. Cost legible in dissolved amulet and transformed heartbeat syncing with chorus. Single meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spatial metaphor: "goodbye" reweights from abstract dread to "magnetic pivot" in final image of horizon "stitched by magnetic intrigue." No moralizing—resonant answer via "world folds into another plane" without stated thesis. Ambiguity lingers in "fragile lattice" cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "eyes heavy with centuries of ennui," "prismatic echoes." Rhythm modulates under pressure—short, tense phrases during mutiny ("Rooms shivering. Lattice defied Euclidean logic"). Lyric compression taught early via "spatial mutiny" pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density: "cursed fragment, glowing green against violet walls" does triple duty. Figurative language coherent even in climax ("dust sparkled, each particle a tiny echo"). Minor deduction for "magnetic resonance" vagueness in corridor description.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "immortal boredom" trope via spatial physics—goodbye as "magnetic pivot" feels fresh. Emotional truth in linking cosmic scale to intimate farewell ("Will you stay?"). Specific crystalline details avoid genericity, but risk-taking slightly safe within genre conventions.</comment>
