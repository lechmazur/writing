<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to understand patterns is clear but interior contradiction lacks embodied struggle; precognitive curse stated without visible cost during ritual execution. Final shift to "compass" feels unearned as no micro-choices demonstrate the transformation under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (patterns malleable), but "weight settled like a mantle" abstracts the price. Strong orientation anchors by line 5, though cost lacks concrete image like trembling hands from visions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid aurora/tide imagery fails micro-setting test; bluff doesn't constrain choices (rocks placed without environmental friction). Kelp-skin detail could charge closure but remains ornamental rather than altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harnessing dust) tightens via density accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—ritual proceeds smoothly without obstacles. Conceptual cost of malleable patterns is legible though physical/emotional toll remains undramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through rock sequences and dust behavior, but "lingering promise" becomes thematic echo in final paragraph with "beacon for all who seek sacred patterns" moralizing. Avoids sentimentality yet over-tells the core concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skin shimmering with wet kelp," "dust glittered like powdered iron") shines, but "pre-cognitively cursed" is diagnostic label-speak in peak beat without embodied cost. Voice modulates well with ritual intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Severe overwriting in climax: "violet flame rose like second sunrise" + "tide seemed to pause, listening" + "borrowed dawn sharing its light" creates figurative muddle. Template cadence in rock-placing sequence ("She [verb], [verb]...") dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic dust + mathematical ritual avoids mysticism clichés, but "pre-cognitively cursed" feels derivative. Strength lies in transforming abstract stakes through tactile rock sequences, though emotional specificity lacks grit.</comment>
