<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but interior conflict superficial. "Quietly driven" trait shown through action yet no visible trade-offs or degradation under stress. Final choice lacks felt cost beyond resolve, missing Q1 9+ test requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern escalation. Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "city’s own willingness to listen" reframes premise. Final image crystallizes stakes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle shells function as active micro-setting constraining every choice (whistle resonance, mosaic discovery). Final image charged by shell patterns humming with "pattern languages," fulfilling 9+ gate. Sensory detail filtered through cartographer’s bias elevates specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pattern discoveries, but escalation lacks visible price. Agency in decoding patterns drives deepening, yet conceptual cost ("willingness to listen") feels abstract without tangible forfeiture. Missing Q4 9+ requirement for unmistakable on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through pattern language: final realization reweights "lost expedition" without stated moral. "Willingness to listen" reframes prior material with conceptual cost, avoiding sentimentality. Perfect 9+ thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sunwashed dread," cartographer’s spiral focus) modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in climax ("wail long enough to ride the wind") showcases voice. Minor register drift in exposition prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-loop in "spiral-shell cartographer whose maps spiraled" but purposeful. High density maintained; final line’s "horizon that no longer seemed unknowable" avoids abstraction. Slight scaffold in exposition prevents 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "city on turtles" trope through shell-ridge linguistics. Emotional truth in Mira’s shift from questioning to carrying patterns. Lacks one fresh inflection beyond worldbuilding; derivative in pattern-language execution.</comment>
