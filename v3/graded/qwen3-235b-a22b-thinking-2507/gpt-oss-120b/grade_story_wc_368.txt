<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses; closure choice (guarding caution) feels received not earned. Micro-choices absent under pressure—Lira passive as donor heart "whispered the answer," undermining agency at pivotal revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "world seemed to hold its breath" crystallizes conceptual cost of bearing iridescent caution. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but escalation lacks deepening—sun trails merely illuminate more objects without narrowing options or raising stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting charges closure: moonlight loom's "threads pulsing with quietly explosive energy" directly mirrors donor heart, making environment constrain the final image. Tea house's humming stone and mist actively guide choices (e.g., steam ribbons illuminating scrolls).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding narrative magnetism) signaled early but escalation static—pressure accumulates without meaningful deepening. Sun trails keep revealing more (scrolls, gardens, loom) without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs; cost remains abstract despite closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thematic echo cripples resonance: "to guard the iridescent caution" explicitly states the moral. Final paragraph sermonizes ("promise of stories forever magnetized"), replacing earned ambiguity with prompt-like language that undermines Q5's 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (dye master's color-focused noticing) shines early, but filter verbs ("feeling," "letting") proliferate in high-pressure beats like the loom scene, dulling immediacy where rhythm should tighten under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Closure-beat artifacts: "Lira, now a conduit... lifted a cup" uses passive voice and stacked filter verbs. "Quietly explosive" repeats 4x with synonym churn ("soft silver," "thin sun trails"), muddling peak imagery while obscuring closure's causal charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis (dye mastery + narrative physics) avoids tropes, but resolution safety-hedges—Lira's effortless mastery ("dared to watch") lacks genuine struggle. Bold risk (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens coherence yet avoids emotional cost, capping originality.</comment>
