<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s "staggering grace" manifests as embodied contradiction (caution/purpose) during piano decoding, but "patient, strategic resolve" leans toward tell. Final choice—planting the seed with chains rusting loose—earns closure through visible cost of freedom’s decay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "chains now rusted loose" crystallizes freedom’s cost as the wall falls. Causal lens holds perfectly—key decoding directly unlocks stairs—yet the humming arrow mechanism edges toward convenience without sufficient prior setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carnival setting constrains choice (piano keys mirror schedule) and charges closure: the crumbling wall literalizes the vault’s inscription. Phosphorescent fungi lighting the descent transforms micro-setting into vital pressure, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the piano bench puzzle demands decoding under famine urgency. Mara’s agency drives escalation—lullaby memory to key presses—with cost unmistakable in "chains rusted loose" as the wall falls, reweighting freedom’s price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "first green shoot cracked through dry crust" answers "plant resilience" without moralizing. The jasmine breeze after planting embodies renewal subtextually, avoiding thematic echo while recharging the "wall" metaphor through literal collapse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature shines in stress: "faint resonance of each note" and "scent of jasmine" reflect Mara’s attunement. Rhythmic compression during key-pressing ("waited for soft click") modulates intensity without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rusted cathedral" and "forged from unexpected tools" achieve crystalline density. Final line "sowing resilience where only dust had lived" recharges motif with propulsion, no figurative muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via specific alchemy: "feathers dyed from ash of old fireworks" and carnival-schedule puzzle. Emotional truth in "weight of generations" avoids generic resilience, with risk-taking heightening stakes through metaphor-literalization.</comment>
