<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("balance self-respect and compassion") lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; Mara's resolution feels earned but internal conflict remains summarized ("convictions wobble") rather than embodied micro-choices during tail reattachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (trust as river requiring tending), but "scars" remain abstract—cost proof falters when dawn's arrival lacks visceral consequence for Mara's renewed resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Misty workshop functions as micro-setting: mist absorbs deception fragments, constrains Mara's tactile healing process, and charges the final "shimmering stillness" where chameleon/human rhythms merge—environment directly shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara's agency (shedding judgments), but the con's betrayal lacks felt consequence—pressure tightens via object arrangement rather than live cost, leaving "scars" unmanifested beyond thematic assertion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through tail-tip reconstruction, but final journal line ("balance is not a static point") edges toward moralizing; avoids full penalty by reweighting prior struggle through river metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("skin a quietly vivid tapestry"), though stress-induced compression falters—Mara's crisis thoughts ("tremor become a blaze") retain poetic polish inconsistent with genuine turmoil.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("shimmering stillness" ×3) and mixed metaphor ("convictions wobble like a candle... tugging like a taut string") dilute closure's impact; otherwise exemplary rhythm and texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wildlife healing and trust reconstruction avoids tropes, but "con" backdrop feels generic—specificity elevates through chameleon's biological truth (tail regeneration) transforming emotional metaphor.</comment>
