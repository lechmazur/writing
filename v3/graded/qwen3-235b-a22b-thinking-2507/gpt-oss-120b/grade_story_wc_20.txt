<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority rich but contradictions lack visceral embodiment; "luminous regret" stated but not physically manifested during peak stress. Micro-choices (measuring unlit fire) reveal discipline yet emotional progression feels intellectualized rather than layered through flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with cost ("fragmented self-knowledge" redeemed through gold seam), but the ritual's abstract stakes weaken tangible consequence. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet pressure lacks sufficient narrowing of options beyond internal realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Foundry constrains choices (anvil placement, storm-slick floor) and charges closure ("rain wash over shoulders" as redemption metaphor). Near-miss at 9-band: furnace glow mirrors emotional shift but "hot iron and old soot" occasionally leans toward atmospheric cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes ("weight of names") signaled early but remain abstract; search party's vanishing introduces potential cost yet fails to concretely tighten her choices. Escalation through ritual intensity lacks visceral trade-off—no tool, time, or emotional resource visibly depleted during the repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from kintsugi ("golden seam reveal weight") and final image ("balance restored, mystical aura anchored in factual harmony"). Avoids moralizing but "redemption was not a single transaction" edges toward thematic echo, saved by immediate tie to gold-pouring action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath anchor her intention like a name etched into air") with rhythmic control during pressure ("gold snake across fissure"). Minor register drift in "unspoken ledger of truth" slightly jars, but compression ("vanishing like mist") teaches pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with zero loops in climax, yet "luminous regret" repetition (glowed with purpose → softened into gratitude) creates subtle synonym churn. Final line’s "droplet reminder" achieves textural precision but earlier "factual harmony with unseen ledger" risks abstract diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/kintsugi with linguistic philosophy; "measuring temperature of fire not yet lit" transforms trope through tactile specificity. Emotional truth in "fragmented self-knowledge" redeemed via craft avoids sentimentality while honoring genre conventions with bold constraint (single ritual scene).</comment>
