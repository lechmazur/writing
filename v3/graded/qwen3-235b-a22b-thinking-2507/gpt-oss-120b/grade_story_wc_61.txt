<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Minimal interior contradiction; motivation clear but abstract ("share light without fire") lacks embodied struggle or micro-choices under pressure. No secondary character to test relationships, leaving emotional progression untested by concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt past 120 words (nebula garden anchors vague until "star-woven vines" lacks spatial immediacy) triggers -0.4 cap. Accumulative lens holds but ambiguity at midpoint caps category; closure (Charged Poise revealing war shadows) has felt cost yet lacks causal pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Orientation debt penalty applies per Q2 ruling. Vivid sensory detail ("petals fell in slow, mournful tides") but nebula garden remains atmospheric backdrop—never constrains choice or alters tactics. Micro-setting (gear) charges final image yet environment fails to pressure decisions as required for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stake ("share light without fire") signaled early with escalation via sonar echoes revealing "shadows of forgotten wars," tightening emotional cost. But pressure lacks protagonist agency—ritualistic sequence feels predetermined, not contested choices narrowing options under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "light without fire" reweighted by final "filament of light" resolving into tangible promise. Avoids moralizing; "troubling serenity" charges closure with conceptual cost of fire’s "cruelty." But thematic resonance slightly over-reliant on abstract recurrence ("generational patterns") rather than concrete character stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sonar pinging resonating through nebula’s crystalline walls") with rhythmic control, yet high-pressure beats risk overwriting ("spectrum of harmonic frequencies... filament of understanding"). Single POV stable but lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated diction unsustained by character context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("released a soft pulse. The pulse traveled outward...") but adjacent lines risk synonym loops ("falling petals drifted like paper lanterns... petals fell in slow, mournful tides"). Figurative language dominates key beats without pattern-teaching, dulling closure’s immediacy despite lyrical beauty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical and organic imagery (gear calculations → sonar choir) transforms sci-fi tropes through emotional specificity. "Troubling serenity" concept elevates stakes, yet some phrases ("weight of every generation’s sigh") edge toward familiar abstraction, limiting risk distinction required for 9+.</comment>
