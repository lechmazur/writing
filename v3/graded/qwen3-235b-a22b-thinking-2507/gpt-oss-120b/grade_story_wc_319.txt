<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("feral" vs "curator") shines in the pendant approach, but embodied cost of "waiting" remains abstract despite strong micro-choices like folding wind into memory; no visceral tradeoff shown for the core endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with "fierce patience a shield," but the conceptual cost of waiting lacks concrete on-page manifestation; "inevitable collapse" is stated not felt at the pivotal choice moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden actively constrains choices (pendant half-buried in snow dictates approach) and charges the final image ("roses unfurled like pages"), with sensory hierarchy perfectly reflecting the guardian's dimensionally homesick urgency through tactile frost and light boundaries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the pendant's physical presence narrowing options (take vs wait), but the cult's threat remains off-page complication rather than coherent pressure; cost of waiting is conceptually weighty yet lacks visceral, dramatized consequence on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "interiorizing exteriors" ritual and mist-woven verses, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights uncertainty as companion with resonant cost in "fragile order," though secondary "dimensional homesickness" slightly dilutes focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"sang in rusted syllables," "breath of wind whispered a chapter"—with rhythmic control shifting from staccato tension to flowing resolution; no head-hopping despite rich interiority under extreme pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with "frost-bitten volumes" and "veil of sleep," but stacked modifiers ("mist-shrouded," "frost-soft lucidity") in high-pressure beats slightly obscure causality; final image remains crystalline despite minor overwriting in the pendant approach sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesis of library/garden as living archive transforms "waiting" trope into visceral stakes; risk-taking with "dimensional homesickness" feels inevitable through concrete details like "amber stone pulsing with garden’s silent heart," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
