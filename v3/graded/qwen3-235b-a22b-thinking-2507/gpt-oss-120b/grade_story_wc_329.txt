<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Limited interior contradiction; violinist’s flawless execution lacks struggle, though embodied yearning ("heart pound like a drum") and micro-choices (placing shell) anchor motivation. No visible flaw costs beyond physical exertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (empty shell beacon) under Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image reweights the orchard’s transformation as ongoing, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—the regime yields too easily to one note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard roots constrain choices (breaking metal soil) and charge the final image (blossoming statues). "Resonantly soft" violin texture evolves from limitation to catalyst, with sensory specificity ("amber hue," "harmonic hums") woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) tightens via the single note’s ripple effect, but escalation lacks earned friction—the statue’s surrender requires no tactical adaptation, reducing cost to mere physical exertion rather than meaningful sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the locust shell’s transformation from relic to beacon reweights "tarnished wonder" without moralizing. Final image ("seeds of resonance") offers resonant answer, though "beauty forged anew" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("battered locust shell pulsed") and rhythmic control under pressure. Sentences modulate from lyrical ("ribbons of light") to staccato ("roots pushed up"), with no head-hopping; elision of backstory taught early via "gap" refrain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("vibrating with cadence of his heart, a signal meant to uproot fear" compresses action/theme). Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near climax slightly dulls immediacy without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of heart rhythms and locust biology feels inevitable, avoiding trope. Risk-taking (Accumulative escalation) heightens stakes, but mechanical regime’s ease of transformation lacks fresh emotional calculus.</comment>
