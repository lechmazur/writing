<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; emotions remain abstract ("eerie nostalgia") without embodied struggle during pivotal prophecy dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via prophecy unraveling, but cost ("weight of unspoken promises") lacks concrete on-page manifestation; Accumulative/Textural lens holds with prism's refracted whisper charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (refracting whispers) and charges closure; "dewdrops" recurrence evolves from atmospheric detail to symbolic cost in final dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (preventing fire-storm prophecy) tighten through saxophonist's agency, but escalation lacks visible price paid during the act; pressure deepens via sensory density rather than tactical cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "vested hush" as non-literal answer to prophecy's violence, but "eerie nostalgia" risks abstract sentimentality; avoids moralizing yet undercuts complexity with near-perfect resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath a filament of color") and rhythmic control sustain Accumulative lens; fog-as-language backstory taught early pays off in closure's whisper mechanics without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("silence, each breath a filament of color stretched taut"); density peaks during prophecy dissolution slightly blur causality without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical silence as weapon against prophecy; transforms "whisper" trope through prism physics and fog linguistics, though safety-middle hedging in flawless resolution limits risk.</comment>
