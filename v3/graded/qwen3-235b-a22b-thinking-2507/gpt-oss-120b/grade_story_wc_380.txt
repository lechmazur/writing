<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "question that haunted her" drives action yet final choice lacks micro-choice stakes. No visible cost scales to length beyond thematic realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("whale's silence would now rest in crystal chamber"), but cost proof is oblique—no exact sentence crystallizes forfeiture. Lens (Accumulative) holds through coffee-ground pattern escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salt chamber constrains every choice: gravity pockets force kneeling/steady breath, final image charges closure via humming walls. Micro-setting functions as environment; cap applied due to Q2<8.8 blocking 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory origin) signaled early but pressure never tightens; coffee-spiral trigger lacks resistance or trade-offs. Agency passive—no narrowing of options under Accumulative lens beyond pattern completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wildflower/salt/light synthesis: "deleted memories compressed into gravity pockets" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image ("memory became a promise") resonates non-literally. Cap applied per Q2<8.8.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("sand fell away like sifted dreams"), rhythm modulates under pressure. Consistent intimate POV; no head-hopping. Cap applied per Q2<8.8 despite rhythmic mastery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "pockets of gravity fluctuated... pulling at boots" then "feeling pockets shift" dulls mid-scene immediacy. Otherwise high density—no figurative muddle—but artifact caps 9+ globally per policy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory physics via salt crystals/coffee grounds avoids tropes; emotional specificity in "pressed wildflowers" elevates. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens coherence. Cap applied per Q2<8.8.</comment>
