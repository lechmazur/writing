<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "feet anchor into earth" amid melting world, but "luminous thread of hope" risks stock phrasing; micro-choices like breath-synchronization reveal values without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with fog lifting to reveal trees, but cost remains abstract; "world expand" lacks visceral price despite strong Accumulative escalation through breath-fog-dream synchronization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard fog functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (breath-welding filaments) and charges final image ("leaves like tiny mirrors"); sensory details evolve causally from "crystal breath" to silver ribbons sealing cracks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as synchronized breathing narrows options from capturing to weaving dreams; felt cost emerges in "roots like veins of silver" implying irreversible change, though not physically dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "weaving separate songs" rather than moralizing, but final "erasing space between" slightly overstates; avoids thematic echo by grounding wisdom in sextant's vapor-sealed cracks and apple scent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "twilight frost shimmered brighter, each crystal facet reflecting ghostly silhouettes"; rhythmic control under pressure via breath-cycle syntax ("inhale... exhale... ripple") with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative muddle in climax ("crystal facets reflecting orchard’s ghostly silhouettes like glass mountains") violates physical logic; paraphrase loops ("breath turning to crystal as the world held its breath") dull immediacy in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of breath as repair tool transforms trope; "sextant repaired by fog" risks whimsy but earns credibility through tactile orchard sighs and silver-root imagery avoiding safety-hedging.</comment>
