<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete struggle ("mind already simply complicated") and embodied disquiet; mirror vision creates micro-choices. Slight abstraction in epiphany about backward memories lacks sufficient embodied contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the cameo's void surging with "whispers of futures that had already happened" reconfigures inheritance with undeniable conceptual cost ("brightened disquiet"). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through bathroom breakthroughs to final constellation map.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bathroom tiles rearranging into shell mosaics actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Astral orchard's luminous pollen settling on skin concretely mirrors internal shift, though asteroid surface details lack tactile specificity during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (understanding nonlinear inheritance) tightens through failed inquiries until bathroom epiphanies force surrender of linear narrative. Cost is visceral when void "flooded his mind with whispers of futures," altering his entire relationship to time with palpable disquiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: pressing the cameo against palm triggers the surge, and "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of constellation map reweights inheritance as living network, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water drummed a steady rhythm," "mind already simply complicated") with rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. Minor register drift when "nonlinear inheritance" is stated rather than embodied early on.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in climax; "void inside surged" delivers high density. Slight paraphrase redundancy in bathroom sequence ("experienced philosophical breakthroughs... illuminating a different strand") prevents 9.3+, but closure remains pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden knowledge" trope through specific mechanics (bathroom epiphanies, shell-as-key). "Brightened disquiet" offers fresh emotional lexicon, and cosmic concepts are grounded in tactile details like weightless shell rippling "like a pond of starlight."</comment>
