<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped; Mara's skepticism informs perception but lacks competing impulses during the climax decision. Embodied emotion ("weight settle into his own ribs") is strong, yet the pivotal choice lacks layered values trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (truth's weight anchoring past), but the "pressure settle into ribs" image lacks visceral specificity to fully satisfy cost proof test. Accumulative lens holds through resonant reconfiguration of "weight" from physical to emotional tonnage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tunnel functions as active micro-setting: valve wheel's beads constrain choice by requiring oscillation alignment, and the final "tunnel seemed to breathe" charges closure. Sensory details (rusted artery, low hum) are selective and urgency-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantifying swallowed truth's weight) tightens through Mara's appraisal method, but escalation feels passive; the radio fragments' "Morse code of fear" deepens knowledge without altering tactics. Cost is felt but not visibly reconfiguring options post-choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "beads calibrated to density of secrecy" reweights truth as measurable burden. Final image ("map of truths waiting to be measured") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, resisting tidy resolution through lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in sensory filtering ("factory ghost shift never seemed fully asleep"), but rhythmic control falters with repetitive "drowsy alertness" (4x), creating template cadence during high-pressure beats that dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in synonym loops ("drowsy alertness" variations) and mixed metaphor ("frozen syllables" vs. "emotional tonnage") reduce clarity in peak beats. No closure-damaging artifacts, but filter-verb stacks ("feeling the pulse," "letting quiet settle") impede propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms haunted mill trope through precise valve-wheel mechanics and emotional weight quantification. Risk-taking in Accumulative/Textural structure succeeds, with "swallowed truth" specificity avoiding genericity, though radio method lacks fresh inflection.</comment>
