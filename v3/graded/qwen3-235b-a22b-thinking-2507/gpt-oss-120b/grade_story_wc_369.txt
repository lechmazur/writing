<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile details (cold brass pulse matching sorrow) avoids label-speak; micro-choices like unspooling filaments reveal hierarchy of values. Motivation (tree-witnessed regrets) drives closure but quantified sorrow risks edge of diagnostic abstraction without sufficient embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: tower inhaling as last strand dissolves with visible cost (quantified sorrow lifting). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increase in dream-tracing reweights sorrow’s burden. Final image (world breathing relief) crystallizes stakes without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (sextant) constrains every choice: broken limb guides mapping, moonlight healing enables deconstruction. Final image (dew-glistened windows reflecting moon) charges closure through prior object recurrence. Sensory hierarchy (wind rattling, floorboards groaning) filters through maintenance worker’s tactile expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: sorrow dimming as dreams map reweights options with felt cost (easing chest pulse). Dominant stake (quantified grief) signaled early; deconstruction forecloses echo-grid’s burden via one decisive deepening. Cost proof: "sorrow in chest ease" as last filament dissolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sextant’s transformation: "mundane miracles" reweighted in final image (world breathing relief) without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—trees’ "distant sighs" answer "what trees witness" through concrete particulars, not abstraction. Epiphany earned via tactile struggle with grid’s filaments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("floorboards groaning like old bones") reflects maintenance worker’s embodied expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented clauses during mapping ("Each line he drew...") shift to flowing cadence at closure. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early (stormlit tower’s hum) pays off in moonbeam dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffolding—"lattice of sorrow" immediately operationalized as humming filaments. Avoids peak-beat overwriting but "wisps of smoke" adjacent to "half-remembered songs" risks paraphrase loop (-0.2). Final line ("lingering glow... waiting to be measured") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "broken tool" trope through sextant’s dual role: dream-mapper and sorrow-quantifier. Emotional specificity in "mundane miracles" avoids genericity—Eli’s ledger note ("measurable peace") grounds magic in maintenance worker’s pragmatism. Risk-taking (quantified sorrow as physical lattice) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
