<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; interiority remains hopeful without struggle, missing the "micro-choice with visible cost" required for high-band scores despite strong embodied detail like "smile had been unlatched."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: fog thinning into "soft sunrise" crystallizes options with undeniable cost in the fragment's dissolution ("essence mingling with starlight"), fulfilling all Accumulative/Textural lens requirements with zero causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (fresco fragment) constrains choice by becoming the "beating heart" of the mural, charging the final image; fog's atmospheric pressure elevates beyond postcard description when trees "trembled like chandeliers" under reflected glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens; dominant stake (rediscovering joy) faces no pressure or narrowing of options—fog thins effortlessly, scholars resolve problems instantly, and the artist encounters zero resistance despite "centuries of thick fog" setting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("pensive mirth" echoing in fog's "gentle chuckle"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "ruined orchard" into "garden waiting for sunrise" as resonant non-literal answer to loss/joy without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("photon-kissed pigment," "knowledge network ripple like a friendly pulse") with rhythmic control during high-pressure creation; no head-hopping despite scholars' network, maintaining singular POV intimacy through somatic details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "exposed film of ancient pigment hovered" demonstrates high density, though "trembling like chandeliers" risks mixed metaphor and "mist kiss her cheeks" edges toward cliché in final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "artist heals community" trope through specific physics of light-paint and knowledge network; "pensive mirth" as tangible tone avoids sentimentality, though risk-taking stays within lyrical tradition without bold structural innovation.</comment>
