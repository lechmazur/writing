<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("feeling the metal pulse like a heartbeat") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear yet shallow without deeper flaw exploration beyond "lucid unrest." Final endurance feels earned but lacks micro-choice hierarchy during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: the net's collapse into a single thread winding the mask crystallizes the accumulated hush with palpable cost ("lucid unrest settle into calm resolve"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as knot-unraveling density reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary actively constrains choice (starlight must be dimmed to avoid blinding) and charges the final image ("muted hymn that echoed the hush"). Sensory details are selective and pressure-driven, with the net's physicality shaping every action under urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via knot-unraveling deepens the dominant stake ("ground restless spirits") with visible cost (Elara's emotional exhaustion), but the "secret" remains abstractly stated. Agency is clear, though secondary pressure lacks tangible complication beyond the net's resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("muted colors that settled like dust"), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights grief as "tamed by patient hands" via sensory resonance, though "reminder that even the loudest grief..." slightly edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("prism’s colors shifted slowly, painting the walls with a soft gradient that seemed to breathe") shows rhythmic control under pressure. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from uneasy ("lucid unrest") to resolved calm without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with propulsion ("Each knot was a memory, and each memory was a restless spirit"), though "a lucid unrest, a calm yet uneasy feeling" borders on looped abstraction. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("stars above traced new patterns") charges closure without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-physical-tangle transforms familiar restoration tropes. Specificity ("tapestry needle etched with runes that promised to accumulate silence") avoids abstraction, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety. Emotional truth anchors universals without derivative safety-hedging.</comment>
