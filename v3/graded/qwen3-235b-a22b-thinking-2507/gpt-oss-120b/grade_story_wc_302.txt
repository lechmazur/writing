<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("cautious exuberance" x3) replaces embodied emotion; no internal conflict or contradictory impulses shown under pressure. Veiled dreamer lacks motivation beyond passive guide role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise in garden) lacks unmistakable cost legibility—ephemeral words' fragility implied but not dramatized. Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks density increase; discoveries feel static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere vivid but setting doesn't constrain choices (e.g., mist/halos create no obstacles). Watch as micro-setting charges final chime, yet insufficiently shapes tactics earlier. Sensory hierarchy lacks urgency-driven narrowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—no tangible cost paid until garden (implied fragility of words). Pressure never tightens; mission succeeds effortlessly despite "cautious" framing. No trade-offs or tactical shifts under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through petals/glyphs without moralizing. Final image ("luminous petals, waiting to be plucked") offers resonant answer to "unspoken words" question. Avoids thematic echo but "promise" line flirts with abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (time/light focus) and rhythmic control shine, though "cautious exuberance" repetition weakens pressure modulation. Stable POV; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor loops ("cyclically reversed" x4, "propagation delays" restated) dull momentum without harming closure. High density in peak beats but no figurative muddle; final line's scent/chime fusion demonstrates propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library tropes via "propagation delays" and petal metaphor, though "fateful letters" feels derivative. Bold risk in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, but watch/crystal mechanics lean on familiar cipher conventions.</comment>
