<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses ("triumph and regret," heart "heavy yet alight") manifest concretely through micro-choices like precise mirror-covering timing, but "poetically inclined" remains label-only until her verse recitation, lacking embodied flaw during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "fractured edge now a compass" crystallizes loss/creation with palpable cost in "burnished sorrow," though "time becomes visible" mechanics slightly blur causality under Accumulative/Textural lens dominant by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Asteroid's marble arches and copper spires constrain choices (mirrors repurposed for light refraction), charging the final image where "gilded corridors echoed with lingering glow" reweights stone as cultural DNA—environment directly shapes rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute tightens into a single deepening: refracted light dissolves factions through "burnished sorrow," with cost legible in Lira's "heavy yet alight" heart; agency shines via verse recitation but pressure lacks tactile escalation beyond visual spectacle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shard's journey "from hands that forged weapons to hands that craft stories," avoiding moralizing; near-miss in "true revolution was no longer battle of arms" risks thematic echo but is saved by being Lira's earned realization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("marble arches etched with forgotten hymns") and rhythmic control evident in storm sequence's cadence shift; non-standard "burnished sorrow" repetition taught early pays off in closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("silver rain" refracting history), but "burnished sorrow" appears 4x in final third bordering on scaffold; final line "humming a lullaby" risks sentimentality yet stays voice-coherent with "defunct rebellion" context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes revolution trope through asteroid archaeology and light-refraction method; "burnished sorrow" transforms generic melancholy into metallic-luster motif that charges closure without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
