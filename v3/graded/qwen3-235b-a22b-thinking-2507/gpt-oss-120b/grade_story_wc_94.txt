<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("invisible cartography of scars") without visceral contradictory impulses; micro-choices (timer setting, whispering poem) lack escalation of stakes or visible cost. Final endurance lacks felt consequence despite poetic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("terrain to be traversed"), but escalation remains atmospheric—no narrowing of options or knowledge shift under Accumulative lens. Storm intensification doesn't reweight stakes beyond sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid storm/observatory imagery lacks causal pressure; brass console and timer don't constrain choices. Recurring envelope/timetable anchors setting but fails Q3 9+ gate by not charging the final image through tangible constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping scars) never faces concrete test; vigil is passive observation with no antagonistic pressure. "Rarefying sorrow" lacks dramatized difficulty—no trade-offs, tactical shifts, or visible price paid under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "scars as cities/river" metaphor; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite conceptual abstraction, earning resonance through luminous ink’s "glow against darkroom dim light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rain hammered the copper dome," "clouds churned like ink") with rhythmic control mirroring storm intensity. Repetition of "furiously tranquil" borders mannered but stays voice-motivated within lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "lightning etched silver veins" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "furiously tranquil" repetition (3x) approaching template cadence in high-pressure beats, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms "poet in storm" trope via bus timetable ritual and darkroom timer metaphor. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens coherence, but "scars as map" concept lacks fresh emotional specificity for 9.0.</comment>
