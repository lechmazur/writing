<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s "feisty" resolve clashing with maternal vulnerability during the ribbon snag. Micro-choices like kneeling with forgotten tools reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Final renunciation of viewing the breach as failure is earned through embodied orchard wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the lenses clicking reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost ("breach... nudged her toward deeper purpose"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—ribbon snag tightens focus to fragility, building toward resonant reconfiguration without causality breaks. Cost legible in reframing the contract breach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ribbon and quartz lenses function as micro-settings that constrain choices: thorns snag the ribbon forcing mending, while powdered amber directly enables lens repair. Final image ("red flutter now a symbol") charges closure through prior particulars, meeting the 9+ gate by reweighting the dominant stake via object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful—ribbon snag crystallizes the "fragile line between care and chaos," narrowing Lira’s options to immediate mending. Conceptual cost is unmistakable when the breach transforms from "careless trade" to "seed of renewal," reweighting stakes through her earned stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions: mending the ribbon becomes the method for mending quartz, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("every fracture holds a seed of renewal") offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question, with accidental wisdom dripping into Mira’s mind without stated morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in Lira’s tool-focused noticing ("charcoal ink, brass needle") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats ("Mira’s startled gasp"). Minor slip: "deciduous vows" repetition slightly over-signals but pays off in closure’s whispered reprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but minor scaffold in light descriptions ("filtered gold through stained glass" then "sunrise painted rafters amber"). No figurative muddle in peak beats—final line’s "accidental wisdom settled like dust" crystallizes theme with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quartz mending with orchard cycles transforms "broken things heal" trope through specific mechanics. Emotional truth in mother-daughter dynamic avoids generic templates, while cathedral-orchard setting resists abstraction with verifiable details like powdered amber’s dual purpose.</comment>
