<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ghost’s yearning drives action but lacks contradictory impulses; shopkeeper’s sudden shift from weary to hopeful feels unearned despite luminous coin reprise. Micro-choices absent during pivotal singing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: shopkeeper’s wish weaves timelines with conceptual cost ("brink of despair" → "hope summoned"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, though orchard’s mechanics slightly obscure causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: apples bursting into notes constrain the ghost’s method and reappear as "soft applause" in final image. Sensory specificity (cinnamon scent, violin sigh) avoids checklist fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through ghost’s escalating echoes ("cascade through maze’s hedges"), narrowing options to one final song. Cost remains conceptual until shopkeeper’s intervention, slightly diluting felt urgency pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through orchard’s evolving light (Tower → sunrise), avoiding moralizing. Final line’s "miracles still echo" skirts thematic echo but is salvaged by concrete tarot coin imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colors that hummed," "rustled brass and liquid violet") sustains under pressure. Shopkeeper’s POV shift at 70% risks head-hopping but earns cohesion through synesthetic continuity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with textural density ("leaves whispering in synesthetic harmony") but "liquid violet" verges on overwriting. Zero loops; final image’s "luminous chime" propels closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tarot symbolism with urban decay avoids trope recycling. Risk-taking (synesthesia as plot device) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though orchard’s magic system lacks grounding.</comment>
