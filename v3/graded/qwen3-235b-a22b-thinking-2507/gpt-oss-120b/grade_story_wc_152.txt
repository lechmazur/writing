<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "disguising wisdom as foolishness" remains labeled trait without micro-choices showing tradeoffs under pressure. Final endurance lacks felt cost—no physical exhaustion or doubt during stitching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: sending the chart forecloses her path with conceptual cost (ember fading to ash). Orientation debt avoided as disorientation serves closure ("echoed silence" motif crystallizes in final breath). Missing visceral cost in protagonist’s body weakens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory’s glass roof reflecting "secret maps" and dormant telescope mirroring thoughts directly constrain choices. Flame’s heat traveling "through silk like a secret signal" charges the final image—environment meets 9+ gate by shaping the embroidery method and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (uncovering coup evidence), but pressure lacks escalation—no opposition or tangible trade-offs. Single tightening (decoding baker’s pouch) deepens knowledge, yet protagonist faces zero resistance; flame "obliges" without cost, undercutting agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "stitching constellations" becomes "stitching truth," culminating in resonant closure ("truth could be sewn"). Avoids moralizing—final image reweights premise with conceptual cost (labor over revelation) without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice has rhythmic control ("autumn leaves rustled, each a whisper") but leans on abstract repetition ("adjacent possibilities"). Perceptual signature falters—embroiderer’s thoughts lack concrete texture, defaulting to lyrical vagueness during high-pressure decoding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Density suffers from mixed metaphor ("echoed silence pressed on ears") and "adjacent possibilities" loops. Strong final line offsets earlier scaffold, but synonym churn in conspiracy descriptions ("conspiratorial lines," "expose," "bribes") dulls momentum in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "lone truth-seeker" trope via textile metaphors (embroidering maps), but "disguising wisdom as foolishness" feels checklist-driven. Fresh angle in cobalt observatory’s glass roof reflecting "secret maps" elevates, yet premise leans on familiar conspiracy framework.</comment>
