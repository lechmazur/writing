<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "awkwardly confident" stated not shown through micro-choices under pressure. Final vow lacks visible cost despite closure attempt, violating Q1 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: "promise fulfilled" negates pressure. Orientation clear by line 3, but stone's autonomous resolution violates "coincidence may complicate not resolve" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Spaceport repair bay anchors early but rarely constrains choices; opera glasses (micro-setting) charge final image by reflecting sunrise in reclaimed hearts. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn't shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("discover meaning") deepen through hum's accumulation, but stone's autonomous response—not protagonist agency—resolves conflict. Cost remains abstract despite "felt" language, failing Q4 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "rhythm she could trace" reweighting opening "mess of broken dreams." Avoids moralizing while earning wisdom via concrete particulars like dust spirals as galaxies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice has distinct texture ("thunderous serenity" cadence) but overwriting in climax: three "hum" repetitions in 5 lines create density violation. Perceptual signature strong through constellation-mapped jacket details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Loops undermine propulsion: "rusted" appears 4x in opening 70 words, "hum" 6x in climax. Filter-verb stack ("she remembered... she whispered... she felt") dulls immediacy during key stone interaction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spaceport decay and stone-circle mysticism elevated by barefoot specificity, but "reigniting rebellion" trope lacks transformation. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
