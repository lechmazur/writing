<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's "affection for doubt" driving the experiment, with embodied choices like tracing geode fractures. Final sending of data earns trust through prior causality, but the conceptual cost of "willowglass hope" lacks tangible forfeiture—resilience feels asserted rather than paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to Charged Poise closure. The static shock→geode resonance→neural feedback escalation narrows options meaningfully, but "telepathy pill recall" backstory feels underwoven, slightly muddying the pressure arc at the midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the muscovite geode constrains every action (tracing fractures, skin mapping) and charges the final image ("slab still glowed faintly"). Sensory details like "neon ribbons catching opalescent veins" avoid cliché by filtering through Mara's scientific precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early—"can skepticism coexist with wonder?"—and tighten through Mara's self-experimentation. Agency drives escalation (programming LEDs, mapping skin), but the conceptual cost remains abstract; the fragility of "willowglass hope" needs more visceral forfeiture to land fully in this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "willowglass" reweights from metaphor to embodied truth via the final geode glow. No moralizing—the resonant answer ("secrets could be shared, not hidden") arises from concrete particulars like somatic markers, avoiding abstraction while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scientific lyricism ("fractally precise intervals," "somatic markers pulse like tiny drums"). Under pressure, syntax tightens ("She reached for the muscovite..."), avoiding uniformity. Single-POV consistency elevates tension without head-hopping risks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "convinced that hidden geometry could translate..." slightly dulls propulsion, but high density dominates: "mapping each flash onto her own skin" does triple duty. No closure-tainting loops; final line's "fractally precise secrets" avoids sentimentality through concrete texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms telepathy tropes via tactile specificity—somatic markers as neural bridge, geode fractures as physical manifestation. Risk-taking (merging light art with neuroscience) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the "willowglass" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh in hindsight.</comment>
