<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "legal phantom" tension and embodied micro-choices like shard retrieval, but "understanding that failure was a teacher" slightly tells rather than shows in climax, denting the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the shard's warmth and "rhythm of her heart align with the universe" reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (bureaucratic erasure), under Accumulative/Textural lens with perfect density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: porcelain shard constrains choice (resonant frequency mechanics) and charges closure ("tucked into coat"), while opal walls amplify the chime—environment actively shapes tactics and final image per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ink-pattern density under Accumulative lens, with Mara's agency driving defragmentation; cost is legible in "bureaucrats had tried to erase," though emotional toll remains slightly abstract versus physical stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: ink patterns revealing the digit error and shard as "broken piece holding meaning" offer non-literal wisdom without moralizing, with final image ("rewrite destiny") perfectly reweighting the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends scientific precision ("quantum server") and lyricism ("frozen lantern"), with rhythmic control under pressure; minor abstraction in "understanding that failure was a teacher" prevents 9.0 despite otherwise flawless voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high-density lines like "droplets fall in chaotic streams that formed fleeting sigils" propel momentum without muddle, and final image ("rhythm of her heart align") crystallizes with absolute clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic horror and digital afterlife via porcelain shard/ink defragmentation feels inevitable; risk-taking (Accumulative structure for tech theme) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s emotional truth.</comment>
