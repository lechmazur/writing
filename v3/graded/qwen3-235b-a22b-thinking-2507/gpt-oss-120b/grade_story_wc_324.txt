<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is thin; "persistently curious" drives action but lacks competing impulses. Final choice feels earned yet untested—no visible cost beyond stated weight. Strong embodied emotion in "statues wept marble tears," but flaw integration remains superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (burden of heroism), but cost legibility falters—"weight settled" is asserted, not embodied. Accumulative lens holds, yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening; pulses guide but never resist protagonist’s will.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mist and hearing aid constrain choices: scanner tuning alters tactics, while restored photograph charges final image. Sensory hierarchy (electromagnetic pulses over visual) reflects urgency. Twilight’s violet light evolves from anchor to thematic carrier without static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting voices) signals early but lacks escalation under pressure. Hearing aid pulses never threaten failure—no narrowing of options. "Sealed alcove" introduces no cost; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through protagonist’s agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through photograph’s restoration, but "incidental heroism" is stated not dramatized. Final image reweights vulnerability via light cascade, yet moral complexity is absent—protagonist faces no ethical trade-off, weakening conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cartographer of sighs," electromagnetic focus) persists under stress. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("reeling hush") to urgent ("pulse synchronized"). Zero head-hopping; non-standard punctuation (em dashes) serves voice without obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion: "circuitry humming like a dying heart" compresses image/emotion. One paraphrase loop ("faint tremor... faint pulse") in opening beat. No figurative muddle in closure—light cascade crystallizes stakes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "contact tracer" with emotional archaeology avoids trope. Risk-taking (hearing aid as transmitter) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed: swapping "photograph" for generic "artifact" would break the closure’s color restoration.</comment>
