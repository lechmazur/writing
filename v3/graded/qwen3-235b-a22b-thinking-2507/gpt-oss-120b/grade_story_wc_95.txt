<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters function as thematic vessels without contradictory impulses; the diplomat's sudden bow lacks earned struggle. "Diplomatically fierce" remains label-only without visible cost tradeoffs. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing when the philosopher locates understanding "in the space between their fencings," with conceptual cost legible in the needle card's transformation. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) slightly weakens causality in escalation beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The danish tin sewing needle card constrains the climax ("pins pointing toward the brook") and charges the final image when needles mark "unanswered riddles." Glass atrium functions as reflective backdrop but fails to actively pressure choices beyond mirroring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstractly conceptual without tangible escalation; the duel's "dignified chaos" lacks narrowing options or concrete cost until the final realization. Agency is murky—characters follow sundial mechanics rather than drive meaningful trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the needle card's evolution from "constellations" to "waypoints," avoiding moralizing. The resonant final image ("where does a question go when it is no longer a question but a destination?") reweights the duel's purpose without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sundial’s half paints guiding the blade’s path," but overwriting risks in "melody only those attuned to paradox could hear." Consistent rhythmic control elevates pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("hidden overture" → "overt theme") and "dignified chaos" repetition dull immediacy. High density compensates, though "mechanized arm whirring down like a sigh" risks purple prose without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes duel tropes with fresh metaphors (sewing needles as "waypoints"), but emotional specificity falters in the diplomat's unearned bow. Avoids middle-ground hedging yet lacks transformative risk in character dynamics.</comment>
