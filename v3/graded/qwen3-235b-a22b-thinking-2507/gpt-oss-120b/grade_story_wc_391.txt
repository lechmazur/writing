<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("restrained wildness") is embodied early but the epiphany lacks earned struggle; "sculpt patience from impatience" is diagnostic label-speak triggering -0.5 penalty without sufficient micro-choice friction to justify the shift. Final renunciation feels unearned despite visible cost ("quiet tether released").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "reshape even the most rigid stone" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("impatient fire cooling to steady ember"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density buildup to the moon-surge beat; felt cost is legible in the ice's "crack... not of breaking, but of release".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("ice sang a thin, glassy hymn") but environment fails 9+ gate: basalt sanctuary and viaduct don't constrain choices or charge the final image. Micro-setting (compass) appears only once without tactical impact; "rustled steel" and "silver veins" lack specificity to shape the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("sculpt patience") signaled early but escalation lacks visible price: the moon-surge beat intensifies pressure yet alters no tactics, and the "crack of release" is environmental, not a paid cost. No trade-off narrows options; tension operates only at sentence level, failing the 8.8+ requirement for cost charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the viaduct's "patient revolution" transforming from abstract idea to embodied reality ("ice seemed to breathe"). Final image of "rigid stone" reshaped by patience reweights prior material without moralizing; avoids thematic echo by showing rather than telling the cost of impatience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon traced a slow arc, its pale light spilling through vaulted arches") with rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression ("Each night the moon traced...") taught early and paid off in the resonant closure; no POV leakage despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("recorded these glimmers... data whispered") triggers -0.2, but zero final-third artifacts. High density maintained ("magnetic pulse rose and fell like the tide") without figurative muddle; "silver smile" metaphor avoids mixed vehicle issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms patience trope through specific magnetic viaduct mechanics and "restrained wildness" duality. Risk-taking ("crack... not of breaking, but of release") heightens stakes without gimmickry, but "rigid stone" metaphor edges toward familiar territory, limiting the 9+ potential despite coherent vision.</comment>
