<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied vulnerability-to-strength transformation via lantern glow and tremor response, but lacks contradictory impulses; serene execution misses friction between cosmic duty and isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands via the tremor's "response" to compassion, crystallizing vulnerability's quiet strength; cost feels conceptual but the earth's pulse lacks visceral weight for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yellow lantern functions as micro-setting: its "molten sunrise" spill charges the final image while constraining the janitor's tracing method; stone balcony and copper tubes anchor sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstractly philosophical ("honor fallen embers") without tangible pressure; the tremor offers mild escalation but lacks narrowing of options or felt cost beyond metaphorical resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through lantern/starlight interplay rather than moralizing; "vulnerability turn to quiet fire" risks thematic echo but avoids explicit statement by rooting insight in physical tremor and molten-light imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "phosphorescent pulse" and "luminous arcs" sustains Accumulative lens; minor register drift in "spiritually curious mind" slightly undermines POV consistency during high-pressure tracing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose sings with "amber hue spilled like molten sunrise" yet falters in "primal elegance settled" abstraction; template cadence ("The world's clamor faded, and...") dulls the closure beat's momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic grief through janitorial ritual avoids trope; "flourishing stillness" redefined as fertile vulnerability elevates the premise beyond mere lyricism with tangible earth-tremor consequence.</comment>
