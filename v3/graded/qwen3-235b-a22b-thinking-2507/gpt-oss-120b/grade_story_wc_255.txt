<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear through bartered awakenings; embodied emotion in "flaws soften into something luminous" shows contradictory impulses. Slight underdevelopment in micro-choices during climax weakens causality of final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("imperfection was the truest melody"), but Accumulative escalation lacks sufficient density increase in final beats to maximize tension under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass courtyard constrains every choice (reed translation, mural from shards) and charges closure via "glass flowers sprouting"; micro-setting excellence with furnace warmth enabling reed vibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in imperfection) tightens via Selene's agency bartering pigment for hues, but cost remains abstractly emotional without concrete forfeiture scaling to closure's magnitude.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "cracked, asymmetrical grace" without moralizing; final image ("crack glowed with a hue she named after jasmine") offers resonant non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cadence of shadows") shines, but rhythmic control falters in high-pressure climax with repetitive "bartered awakenings" phrasing dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops, but "bruised with orange and violet" creates subtle metaphor clash (bruises imply pain, beauty blooms from ruin) muddling clarity in a pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of colorblindness and plant acoustics transforms "beauty in imperfection" trope; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring closure's conceptual cost.</comment>
