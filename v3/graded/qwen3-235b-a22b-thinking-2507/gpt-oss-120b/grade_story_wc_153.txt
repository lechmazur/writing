<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete but lacks contradictory impulses; the medium’s guilt over unsent letters manifests as passive weight, not active resistance. No visible struggle when evoking the apology undermines micro-choice depth at pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: dissolution of letters into fireflies crystallizes stakes with felt cost (grief evaporated). Orientation anchors within 20 words, but "fierce tenderness" repetition slightly dulls escalation’s conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mangrove roots actively constrain choices ("paths seemed to shift," "roots parting like soft hands"), charging the final image where the labyrinth "whispers approval." Micro-setting (condensation veil) evolves causally to enable the apology’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: evoking letters narrows options from internal burden to external release. Cost (dissolved grief) is legible, but the spirits’ intervention risks passive resolution—mitigated by her embodied act of breathing deep to "evoke buried voices."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "apology had never needed words, only the act of evoking truth" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image (fireflies as "bright promises") avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roots intertwined like whispered verses") modulates with pressure; condensation-script imagery deepens under stress. Minor register drift in "fierce tenderness" repetitions slightly blurs voice specificity at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but adjacent metaphors ("living hymn"/"whispered verses") create subtle scaffold. "Fierce tenderness" recurs 4×, bordering on loop; final-third repetition caps Q7 below 8.8 despite lyrical control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "unsent letters" trope via condensation-writing mechanic and mangrove spirits. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes coherently, though "fierce tenderness" phrasing echoes familiar emotional binaries without full novelty.</comment>
