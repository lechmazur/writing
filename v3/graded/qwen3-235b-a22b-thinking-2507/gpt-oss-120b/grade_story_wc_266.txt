<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on poetic abstraction ("pulse of hope," "unused courage") rather than embodied contradiction; Mira's flaw (past leash-bound life) lacks visible struggle during the chest-opening climax, undermining earned change. No contradictory impulses act in the pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost in "star etched upon her soul," but "weight of ferry guides’ trust" remains abstract—cost proof test fails as no exact sentence shows visceral toll. Orientation clear early, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) weakens pressure legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the ticket punch’s metallic click and star stamp physically constrain the chest-opening choice, charging the final talisman image. Sensory details (pebble pier, frayed rope) evolve with plot, though "shoreline lullaby" tone lacks pressure-modulated shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unused courage) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ferry guides drive the journey. Cost is felt ("sudden freedom") yet abstract; no visible trade-off during the cave sequence narrows options insufficiently for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the star-stamped ticket’s evolution from "promise" to "talisman" reweights "unused courage" without moralizing. Final image ("star etched upon her soul") resonates as non-literal answer, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("star as pulse of hope," "ferry’s lantern glowed like a lullaby") shines, but "gently persistent" appears as label twice without showing tactical cost. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" moments slightly dulls consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Severe artifact penalty: "ticket punch with star stamp" repeats verbatim 5 times, creating synonym churn (stamp/punch) and template cadence in closure beats. Final-third prose muddle ("rows of faded letters that formed a map") dulls the chest-opening climax’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courage-as-seed metaphor with nautical motifs feels inevitable, but "veiled ridgeway" and "star stamp" border on fantasy tropes. Emotional specificity in Mira’s dog-leash loss elevates risk-taking without gimmickry.</comment>
