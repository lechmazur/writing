<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; "dynasty ender" status remains label without shaping micro-choices. Epiphany about "listening eloquently silent" feels unearned as the gramophone reveals truth effortlessly. No visible cost to discovery despite high-stakes premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds but cost legibility fails: "golden shadows deepen" is abstract, not concrete price. Closure (Conceptual Repricing) lacks felt consequence despite thematic weight. Orientation succeeds early but payoff lacks tangible trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sepia room and gramophone create vivid atmosphere, yet neither constrains choices—wood grain "speaking" operates magically without physical logic. Micro-setting (crank handle) lacks causal role; missed opportunity for tool-as-setting to charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering truth) signaled early but pressure never escalates: gramophone works perfectly on first try with zero struggle. No narrowing of options or visible price paid; "betrayal by ignorance" revelation lacks dramatic weight due to absent opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment><question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through golden shadows and standing waves, but final paragraph's explicit thesis ("ending a line was not about destruction...") triggers -0.5 Thematic Echo penalty. Confession of "silent betrayal" offers complexity yet moralizing undercuts earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "first yawn of evening" and "ribbons of light," with rhythmic control during gramophone sequence. Minor register drift in "eloquently silent" abstraction, but voice remains cohesive and pressure-appropriate throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Breathed a hush that felt eloquently silent" creates contradictory abstraction, while "ribbons of light" mixes sensory domains. Template cadence ("He realized...") near climax triggers -0.4 artifact penalty; prose remains lyrical but occasionally obscures cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory physics (standing waves) with historical discovery elevates trope. "Betrayal by ignorance" moral calculus feels specific, yet hidden-scroll mechanism lacks transformation—remains safely derivative despite lyrical execution.</comment>
