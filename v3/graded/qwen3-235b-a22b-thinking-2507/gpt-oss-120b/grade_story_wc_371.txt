<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "heuristically gentle" yearning vs. fragility of peace lacks embodied escalation; "tenuous absolution" remains thematic label without concrete tradeoffs under pressure during bread-sharing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("fragile peace" crystallizing ordinary moments), but escalation lacks pressure escalation—bread discovery deepens meaning without narrowing options or raising stakes per Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vines reclaiming stone and bread crumbs on tea leaves constrain choices (guerrilla gardening as protest) and charge final image; sensory specificity ("crust still warm in memory") elevates beyond decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sacred in ordinary) deepens via bread discovery but pressure never tightens—no trade-offs, costs, or narrowed options; "fragile peace" feels unearned without prior conflict escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through crumbs as "tiny punctuation marks" reweighting bakery memory, avoiding moralizing; final image ("absolution as fragile as crust") offers non-literal answer to "tenuous absolution" without stating moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read the subtle bloom of a weed as confession") with rhythmic control, but "heuristically gentle" and "tenuous absolution" drift into abstract lexicon during peak reflection beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("crumbs fell onto tea leaves like tiny punctuation marks"), but "uncloak its hidden purpose" and "heuristically gentle" constitute elevated diction clashing with POV lexicon in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Specific synthesis of guerrilla gardening and bakery bread transforms "sacred ordinary" trope; risk-taking (textural Accumulative drive) heightens stakes but "tenuous absolution" concept lacks fresh inflection beyond lyrical execution.</comment>
