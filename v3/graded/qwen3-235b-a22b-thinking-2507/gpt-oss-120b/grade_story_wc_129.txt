<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "boldly sympathetic" trait never faces meaningful trade-offs or internal conflict. Arlen's motivation remains abstract ("graft onto community") without visible flaws complicating choices—no cost when villagers instantly join her search. Final endurance feels unearned as prior resistance is absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Charged Poise closure, but cost proof fails: "luminescent ache softening into steady glow" lacks legible price. No visible sacrifice or constraint at climax—glyph discovery requires no struggle, undermining escalation. Orientation succeeds early but closure cost remains conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity ("obsidian bark fracturing sunbeams into violet") anchors setting, but environment never constrains choices—reeds and arbor serve as passive symbols rather than active pressures. Micro-setting (carved reeds) charges final tapestry image yet doesn't alter tactics mid-scene, missing Q3 9+ gate requirement for choice constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community connection) signaled early but pressure never coheres—search for tag faces zero resistance, villagers join without friction. Under accumulative lens, escalation lacks deepening: sensory density increases but stakes remain abstract ("shared longing") with no visible price paid. Final softening ache implies cost but doesn't legibly charge the image per band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through reed tapestry and evolving tag symbolism, avoiding moralizing. Ending offers resonant CR ("tag was not a mark... but a living symbol") via Lira's sunrise droplets, reweighting prior material without stated moral. Near-miss on "fragile, beautiful duty" line but saved by concrete action (weaving reeds) grounding insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ground itself whispered," "luminescent ache") with rhythmic control under pressure—syntax compresses effectively at nightfall ("Night fell, and the crater’s rim glimmered..."). Minor repetition of "luminescent ache" risks tic but remains voice-motivated. No POV leakage; all details filtered through Arlen's embodied sensitivity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High density with strategic telling (e.g., compressed backstory on tag legend), but "luminescent ache" repetition (4x) creates synonym churn in peak beats. Opening scaffold ("perched at the edge") slightly dulls momentum, yet no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line's "rewrite the language of belonging" verges on abstraction but offset by preceding concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological art + community ritual (reed bridges as "questions"), with risk-taking in quiet closure. Emotional specificity avoids sentimentality ("fragile, beautiful duty"). Derivative elements ("obsidian arbor as lighthouse," interlocking circles) limit transformation—premise works unchanged if orchard becomes forest, capping originality despite strong execution.</comment>
