<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Label-only "resiliently positive" trait repeated without embodied contradiction; climax lacks visible cost for endurance. Diagnostic phrasing ("resiliently positive resolve") in peak beat triggers anti-pattern penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost of time reversal paradox, but "permanent transient heartbeat" abstracts cost rather than making it legible. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost proof test fails—no concrete image of paid price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Spectral grotto serves as vivid backdrop but never constrains choices; micro-setting (hourglass) charges closure, yet dominant setting remains ornamental. Misses 9+ gate requirement for environment to shape tactics or final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density (radio waves, rising sand) under Accumulative lens, but conceptual cost ("paradox of permanence") remains abstract. Agency-driven escalation lacks unmistakable on-page price—urgency of commuter rush vs. eternity feels unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of intention aligning cosmos emerges through radio/hourglass particulars without moralizing. Final image ("intention can align the cosmos") resonates non-literally, though "resiliently positive spirit" risks thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV stable with selective perceptual bias, but drumbeat rhythm ("Lio adjusted... Lio turned... Lio stepped") dulls pressure in high-stakes beats. Syntactic monotony undercuts rhythmic control required for 8.0+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: "lattice of sound that glimmered like phosphorescent threads" violates density rule with stacked metaphors. Template cadence ("Lio [action], [consequence]") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty in high-pressure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-bending via sound patterns feels organic, yet "clocks run sideways" trope lacks transformation. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens coherence but doesn't reach 8.5+ due to derivative premise guardrail.</comment>
