<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("weight of memories") over embodied contradiction; "feeling the weight settle into her hands" lacks concrete sensory trade-offs. Diagnostic phrasing like "understood that to find the sound... she must first hear the silence" triggers −0.5 penalty for unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands via the humming device reconfiguring trust as malleable, but cost remains conceptual ("weight of memories") without visceral on-page sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds consistently through density of color-sound motifs, yet fails cost proof test—no specific image anchors the price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse actively constrains choices: kelp impedes movement, brine distorts aurora's light into tool (colored pulses), and shipwrecks' "sighing metal" becomes data source. Final image of "violet and copper" water charged by forge glow directly reweights betrayal/hope stakes through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming broken trust) tightens via forge's "inhaling the void" to produce lullaby, but pressure lacks concrete trade-offs—no option foreclosed or resource lost. Accumulative escalation deepens meaning but avoids tangible cost; "cells divide" timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral's "missing song" and rusted mast's "muted amber," avoiding moralizing. Final image of "crack of trust rejoined" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question. Only flaw: "memory itself is a forge" risks thematic echo but stays subtextual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "faint teal of a dying rose" and "muted amber of a rusted mast" filters all observation. Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("cells divide in hidden hydroponic beds") to urgent ("she must first hear the silence") under pressure, with patterned elision (no backstory) taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ashen forge emitted sparks that fell like rain" achieves high density without muddle. Minor register drift in "resonant reconfiguration" metaphor but stays voice-coherent. Final line’s "soft crack of trust rejoined" avoids cliché through precise sonic texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia + shipwrecks feels inevitable: coral’s absence becomes data, aurora paints water with "violet and copper" betrayal/hope. Derivative risk in "trust breaking" concept elevated by tactile specifics (kelp-laden glass, soot-gray fire). No safety-hedging in moral ambiguity.</comment>
