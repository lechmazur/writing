<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; "infinitely patient" trait remains abstract label without testing under pressure. Motivation ("restore shared balance") is clear but unearned through embodied struggle—no visible flaw complicates choices during rebuilding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "balance settled like dust on a drum" making cost legible, but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through rhythmic density buildup to revival, though escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ebony tuning fork constrains choice (triggering resonance) and charges final image, but archway remains postcard backdrop until silver lattice moment. Sensory details vivid yet occasionally generic ("scent of pine and iron" lacks character-specific filtering).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival) signaled early but pressure never concretely tests commitment; no live option foreclosed or trade-off made. Escalation through rhythmic density works, yet cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt until final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of "shared balance" stated explicitly in final paragraph ("protected shared balance"), triggering -0.7 penalty for thematic echo. Resonance arises from particulars (footsteps as rhythm) but undermined by moralizing conclusion lacking earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "whispered of forgotten festivals" and "sigh of the wind" diction, but tense shifts ("had waited"/"placed"/"moved") create subtle distance drift. Rhythmic control strong yet occasional corporate register ("balance once shared") jars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Opening sentence’s 37-word complexity obscures causality; "dust on a drum" simile in closure beat triggers -0.7 artifact penalty. Template cadence in rebuilding sequence ("stones sliding... timber aligning") dulls immediacy despite lyrical propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "rhythm as rebuilding force" feels inevitable, yet "cryptic bell tuner" archetype lacks specific cultural grounding. Risk-taking (textural escalation over causal turns) heightens stakes but safety-middle hedging in moral resolution limits boldness.</comment>
