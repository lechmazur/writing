<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("profit, power, secretly sentimental yearning") remains abstract; pivotal egg release lacks embodied micro-choices showing competing impulses. Final tear is telling, not showing struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the lingering echo reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("fragment of grace forged from cruelty"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shift at fracture moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Salt flat functions as micro-setting (vanishing footprints, resonance properties) charging the final image, but the crack-map isn't actively used—it describes rather than constrains movement during the pivotal release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thunder's lull creates a live clock forcing precise action; the single tightening (wind pause for release) forecloses silence through echo with visible cost (tear tasting "of sand and redemption"). Agency drives escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "even in engineered scarcity, a single act could carve song from silence" reweights drought's cruelty without moralizing. Final echo scattering as "broken glass that felt whole" offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sun painted each crack like unfinished map") but elevated diction ("hollowness of desiccated plain") occasionally clashes with character perspective. Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in paragraph 2 ("The map... traced... He had learned...") and three consecutive "He [verb]" stems weaken propulsion. No closure-impacting artifacts, but prevents 9.0+ with slight cadence rigidity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic physics and ecological grief avoids cliché through specific mechanics (brine pool resonance). "Fractured grace" concept feels inevitable yet surprising, with risk-taking in quiet climax heightening stakes.</comment>
