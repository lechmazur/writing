<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract emotional labels ("melancholy teal," "bittersweet note") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure; motivation is clear but lacks genuine struggle, making the final realization feel unearned despite strong voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (bridge restoration crystallizing memory's fragility with rose-colored cost), but escalation lacks organic pressure—seeds translate flawlessly without resistance, missing a meaningful tightening before the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the cave, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint; crater glass charges the final image yet never shapes tactics during the quest, failing the 9+ gate for environment-driven choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes (disappearing paths) are clear, but pressure doesn't accumulate organically—the seed method works perfectly on first attempt with no earned reversal or tactical cost until closure, undermining agency under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory's fragility emerges through the bridge restoration, but near-moralizing lines ("fragments can be gathered and healed") undercut complexity; the final image resonates without stating a moral yet lacks layered ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kaleidoscopic shadows," "humming colors") sustains lyrical rhythm, but abstract emotional labels ("cheerful gloom") create distance; no head-hopping, though peak beats lean on thematic abstractions over concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stunning imagery suffers from density overload—"transliterates emotions," "fragile tide," and color metaphors repeat without pattern-teaching; minor loops in seed/glass descriptions dull closure momentum despite strong opening/closing lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-physical-substance tropes ("sea-foam recollectionist," emotional translation via glass) feels distinctive, but "disappearing paths" concept lacks transformative stakes; risks lyricism over emotional truth without deeper human complexity.</comment>
