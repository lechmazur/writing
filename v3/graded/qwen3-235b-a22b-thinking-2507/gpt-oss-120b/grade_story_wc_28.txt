<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("steel resolve" vs. empathy) lacks simultaneous tension; motivation remains abstract despite pivotal rename. Final choice earns closure but micro-choices under pressure feel sparse until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (retrocognitive dissolution), but "weight of centuries lift" slightly abstracts the felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through "warm coldness" reweighting, though orientation anchors narrowly clear the 120-word threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mosaic stepping stone functions as essential micro-setting, constraining the rename action and charging the final image as "blueprint for rebuilding hearts." Sensory detail leans visual but "warm coldness" integrates atmosphere with thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally through "warm coldness" evolution, but protagonist agency lacks escalation—pressure arrives via stone's demand rather than earned tactical shifts. Cost ("retrocognitively trapped past dissolve") feels resonant yet insufficiently visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "Hearthsteel" synthesis, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("steel and skin share breath") reweights mercy as engineered, though "aberrant mercy" concept lacks sufficient friction to deepen the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("soot-gray stones," "wounded beacon") with rhythmic control, but "retrocognitively trapped" creates jarring register drift in peak tension. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with vivid propulsion ("cascade of light stitched the broken sky"), but "retrocognitively trapped" constitutes overwriting in high-pressure beat. Final thematic near-echo ("compassion could be engineered") risks dilution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "steel empathy" avoids soft/hard binaries, yet "gentle radical" trope remains underdeveloped. Emotional specificity in "warm coldness" elevates familiarity, but structural risk-taking feels cautious within accumulative framework.</comment>
