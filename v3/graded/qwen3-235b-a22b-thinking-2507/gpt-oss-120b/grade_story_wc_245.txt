<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "navigating uncharted emotional depths" remains abstract without embodied struggle against caution or fear. No visible tradeoffs for language-absorption trait despite its centrality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with "map of her soul complete," but cost remains conceptual ("love, loss, hope") not legible on-page. Orientation test passed early with "blind mapmaker" and "ultrasonic forest" anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest actively constrains choices through sound pathways and emotional currents; wounded oak sorrow shapes immediate tactics. "Platinum ring" micro-setting charges the final image as Lira leaves "trail of soft notes" trusting its guidance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding stillpoint) signaled early, but escalation lacks pressure—melody guides flawlessly with no resistance or cost. "Crescendoed near ancient bark" deepens tension but resolves without narrowing options or tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic echo in climax: "map drawn in feeling, compass forged from empathy" states thesis outright. Final "map of her soul" moralizes rather than earning resonance through prior particulars, triggering -0.6 penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("skin absorbs languages," vibrations as navigation) shines, but pressure modulation falters—approaching stillpoint uses analytical syntax ("She placed her hand...") instead of fractured rhythm under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in "Each step... Each new phrase" creates paraphrase loop. Worst flaw: final "map of her soul" is therapy-speak label that dulls closure image, applying -0.5 artifact penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping tropes (ultrasonic pathways, emotion-as-terrain) feels inevitable. Emotional clichés ("uncharted emotional depths") slightly undermine specificity, but forest’s language of "rustling leaves" offers verifiable detail.</comment>
