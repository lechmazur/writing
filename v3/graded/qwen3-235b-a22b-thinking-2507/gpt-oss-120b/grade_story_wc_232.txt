<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "lingering promise" as both burden and compass is concrete, but "diagnostic label-speak" in "tighten around his chest like a rope" undermines embodied emotion during pivotal choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("final decision" weight), but orientation fails: "blooming cavern" introduced at 150+ words without prior signal, triggering -0.4 penalty and capping Q3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Creek’s rhythmic drips function as micro-setting that charges closure ("echoing ticking... moments between choices"), but orientation debt caps score per rubric; cavern lacks pressure on choices beyond being a location.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes (finding doorway) tighten via creek’s rising, but "following ants home" is coincidence-driven resolution—not protagonist agency—undermining escalation; cost ("quiet certainty") feels earned yet passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ants" motif reweighted at closure ("smelled of fresh blossoms"), but final paragraph’s "decisions are made not in isolation" borders on thematic echo, deducting -0.4 from base score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of old parchment lingered like a memory of distant seas") sustains accumulative lens, though "whispered promises to the ink" slightly overreaches POV plausibility in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lingering promise tighten around his chest like a rope" mixes metaphor and physicality, dulling closure beat; paraphrase loop in cataloguing new routes ("annotated with tiny chip that glimmered") triggers -1.5 accumulation cap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "matrix chip" as decision-tool avoids trope, but "doorway of decisions" concept leans on familiar magical realism; specificity in ant-guided trails elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
