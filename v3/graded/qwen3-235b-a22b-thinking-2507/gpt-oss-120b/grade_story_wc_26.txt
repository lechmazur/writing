<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "luminous regret" versus action is concrete, but micro-choices lack escalation under pressure; preservation motive stays abstract until final recording beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "luminous regret melt into gratitude" showing felt cost, though lens (Accumulative/Textural) clarity arrives slightly past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (river stone) constrains choice by requiring alignment with footage; "clouds" motif charges final image, but "blooming library" lacks tactile specificity to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through footage comparison, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; "shadow unbound" revelation feels passive rather than earned protagonist-driven deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone’s transformation ("hope crystalized"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "unbound" as active carrying, not passive preservation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer"), but "metamorphose" and "luminous regret" drift into abstract diction against established lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repetitive "luminous regret" and "softly deliberate" loops dull closure beat; otherwise strong rhythm, but text artifacts in final third disallow 9.0+ per penalty rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-living-entity works, but "river stone" trope lacks transformation; risks (lyric compression) heighten coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
