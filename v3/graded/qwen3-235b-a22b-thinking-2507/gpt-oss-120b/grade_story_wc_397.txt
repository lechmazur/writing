<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("skin felt thinner," parasol tip as tactile anchor) but lacks contradictory impulses; euthanasia-to-solace shift feels over-tidy without visible struggle against the "fold in patience" realization. Flaws don't complicate the pivotal epiphany, reducing earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("grip on reality loosened like the lace tip slipping") under Accumulative lens. Orientation solid within 120 words; pressure tightens via sensory accumulation toward wind's "language" revelation. Minor deduction: epiphany slightly unmoored from prior struggle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina functions as active micro-setting: ice shifts under dock constrain movement, parasol tip's fragility charges closure. Sensory details selective and urgent ("frothy white spray that sang"), avoiding checklist syndrome. Meets 9+ gate—object constrains choice and charges final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fear of endings vs. seeking quiet release) tightens through Accumulative pressure as wind/ice motifs deepen. Cost legible in "grip on reality loosened" tactile detail. Agency passive (listening/observing) but valid for lens; could deepen protagonist's active choice in climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "fold in patience" reframing—final line ("solace is not the absence of endings") earned via concrete trawling imagery. Zero thematic echo; avoids moralizing by embracing ambiguity of "gentle bend" in time. Perfect 9+ quick test fulfillment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("world had folded patience into my marrow") with rhythmic control during high pressure ("Night fell, and the ice shifted"). Minor register drift ("dirge," "susurrus") fits reflective tone. Patterned elision taught early via fevered dreams; no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong density but subtle scaffold: "trawling for supplies, for stories, for elusive cadence" risks template cadence. Final paragraph slightly overwritten ("journals pages fluttered like the wind"). Zero fatal artifacts; avoids filter-verb stacks. Costly loop penalty avoided.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms euthanasia tourism trope via "sound of endings" specificity and lace parasol's fragility. Emotional truth in "volunteers' stories formed a chorus" avoids cliché. Fresh synthesis of familiar material through precise sensory logic; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
