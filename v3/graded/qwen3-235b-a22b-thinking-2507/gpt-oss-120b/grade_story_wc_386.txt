<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid via concrete actions ("weave truth carefully, threading ice filaments") but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; motivation clear yet uncomplicated by genuine struggle, missing the 9+ test's earned conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (world "holding its breath"), but the exact cost legibility falters; the whisperer’s seamless success lacks visible friction despite strong Accumulative/Textural lens adherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacier ice setting actively constrains choice (shrine’s fragility, candle-lit navigation) and charges the final image; "borrowed starlight" evolves from atmospheric detail to solidified truth in veins, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through dream-pattern accumulation, but pressure lacks narrowing cost; the whisperer encounters no resistance (globe "pulsed brighter" instantly), missing the escalation’s felt price required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from melted globe’s reassembly as "salvaging purity," with final sunrise offering resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing but secondary stakes feel underdeveloped per cross-cap limiting Q5.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragrance of pine and salt" anchoring dreams) and rhythmic control shine, though micro-choices lack tension; voice modulates flawlessly from "liquid mirror" to "luminous hush" without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "amber glow" to "beacon" reprise avoids overwriting, but "filaments" metaphor slightly strains when applied to both ice and memory in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of wreck-diving and dream-weaving feels inevitable, yet risks hedging (no true antagonist); specificity elevates tropes but safety-middle avoidance lacks boldness for 9+ despite strong emotional truth.</comment>
