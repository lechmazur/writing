<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance creates authentic tension; micro-choices like repainting banners reveal contradictory impulses. But "orderly intuitive mind" leans tell over show during crisis, and embodied emotion lacks specificity in pivotal moments like the phoenix message.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the phoenix mural crystallizes community resolve with undeniable conceptual cost ("the fight had only begun"). Accumulative pressure through graffiti patterns holds consistently, though council's sudden postponement edges toward convenient resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Raft city actively constrains choices—riverbank relocation shifts stall economics—and the foundation chip charges the final image. Sensory details ("carnival lights flickering against misty dawn") reflect Mira's priorities, with environment dictating tactics like artisan quarter reorganization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving carnival soul) tightens through Mira's agency: encoding graffiti narrows options toward community reorganization. Conceptual cost (ongoing gentrification threat) legibly charges the final image, though privatization pressure could feel more viscerally immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the phoenix mural reweights "rebirth" without moralizing, answering gentrification through concrete action. Final image—"children played beneath its glow"—resonates with earned ambiguity, avoiding false equivalence about corporate threats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("kaleidoscope of music," "hopeful desperation like steam") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in high-stakes graffiti sequences, though "legal briefs" momentarily drifts into corporate diction during council resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with concrete verbs ("sprayed coded silhouettes"), but synonym churn ("relentless wonder"/"restless soul") and template cadence ("Every night... while...") dull immediacy in mid-beats. No closure artifacts preserve impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via raft-specific mechanics: graffiti as living resistance feels inevitable. Bold Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the foundation chip's evolution from relic to communal anchor demonstrates fresh synthesis.</comment>
