<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (kneeling, arranging caps) with embodied emotion ("spores tickle her senses"), but contradictory impulses lack sufficient simultaneity during pivotal sextant moment; micro-choices reveal values yet flaw integration feels slightly smoothed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost ("taste of crisp nostalgia lingering like salt"), driven by accumulative/textural lens; orientation established by 100 words, sextant discovery tightens options meaningfully without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipwrecks and fairy ring function as micro-setting that constrains choices (mapping memory currents via hulls) and charges final image (saplings unveiled); sensory details ("brine-laden air," "amber light") reflect urgency without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist's agency (arranging caps triggers receding water), with visible cost in the sea's duality ("kept its secrets, but also kept its gifts"); escalation via pattern break in mushroom arrangement narrows options under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (fungal ring as memory archive), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "stolen memories" as rooted in community hearts without stated moral, though "crisp nostalgia" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("detect mythic energy by studying broken constellations") with rhythmic control, but minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing slightly disrupts folklorist's lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with zero loops; "crisp nostalgia" charges closure, but near-duplicate phrasing ("broken and rearranged," "scattered like driftwood") in high-pressure beat slightly dulls propulsion without harming causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of folklore/environmental memory avoids tropes; "fungal ring as archive" transforms premise through specific stakes, though emotional complexity lacks one non-obvious moral calculus to reach 9.0.</comment>
