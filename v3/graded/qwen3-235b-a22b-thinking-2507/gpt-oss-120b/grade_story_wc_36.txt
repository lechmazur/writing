<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "breath was avalanchingly quiet" embodying tension between driven action and necessary silence; final choice to "listen to every failure" earned through tactile journey. Slight abstraction in "weight of unfinished cycles" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: thunder's "low chord" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("true guardianship woven from quiet failures"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the seam-widening vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Canyon hush actively constrains choices (steps "muffled as if ground swallowed noise") and charges final image ("wind carry silent song into stars"). Micro-setting (flute's silence) directly enables path-finding and closure's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulative pressure: wind's "subtle notes" to seam's "pulse" to vibration that widens reality. Mara's agency drives escalation (flute manipulation), with visible cost in her realization that old keepers "ignored quiet of failure."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "canyon hush" transforms from oppressive force to teacher of failure's lessons. Final image offers non-literal answer ("wind carry silent song") without moralizing, reweighting "quiet failures" as essential to growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "metal veins catching sunrise" and "texture of possibility." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—terse during seam-crossing ("each step measured"), flowing in reflection—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line propels atmosphere or character. "Avalanchingly quiet" avoids cliché through precise integration. Minor deduction: "promise a song that could open seams" slightly tells rather than shows in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "weaving worlds" trope through tactile specifics: driftwood markers guided by thunder-echo, flute turned upside down to "fill void with silence." Emotional truth in "guardianship woven from quiet failures" avoids abstraction.</comment>
