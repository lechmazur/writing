<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation (childhood lullabies) is clear but interior contradiction absent; painter remains "perceptively calm" throughout without embodied struggle or micro-choices under pressure, weakening earned change despite strong backstory integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (mirrors showing doors) lacks visible cost; no on-page sentence demonstrates foreclosed path or price paid, violating Q2 cost proof test despite Accumulative/Textural lens coherence and prism parapet's Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Terrace functions as micro-setting that charges closure through echoing footfalls and wet tiles guiding color, but prism parapet's glittering "glass singers" leans toward ornamental symbolism rather than constraining choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes ("possibilities") remain abstract despite early signaling; escalation lacks tangible cost or narrowed options, with bell-ringing resolution feeling coincidental rather than earned by painter's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "borrowed heartbeat" and coded lullabies, but final moralizing ("possibilities are merely reflections...") replaces earned resonance with near-literal statement, weakening non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stone air," "wet tiles") shines, but tense/stability wavers in reflective blocks; "children’s voices floated up like incense" momentarily drifts into non-POV lyricism, risking committee voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: 12+ metaphors in 80 words ("choir of tiny glass singers," "invisible ribbons of hope") create density muddle; template cadence ("He moved...", "The hush...") triggers -0.6 loop penalty in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of painter/musician trope via coded lullabies, but "borrowed heartbeat" concept feels derivative of magical realism templates without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
