<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira’s face-blindness drives her tactile focus on light, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in action; "discovering limits was a gift" risks diagnostic label-speak without embodied struggle during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise—the mural holding amid collapse reconfigures stakes with visceral cost ("the sky inside seemed to inhale"), though the Accumulative lens weakens slightly when time pressure isn’t actively narrowed beyond pigment intervals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk functions as micro-setting: bark walls constrain pigment application, and the coin’s physicality charges the final image; sensory details ("crushed lapis, ground bone ash") are purposefully filtered through Lira’s craft urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Demolition deadline tightens stakes credibly through Lira’s ritualistic pigment timing, but escalation lacks one visible price paid mid-scene (e.g., time lost to mixing errors) to deepen the cost before closure’s tremor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the coin’s "indentations" becoming "thresholds," avoiding moralizing; the final "cathedral of sky" reweights limits as liberation without abstract statement, though secondary "fractally precise" motif feels under-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile light descriptions ("brushstroke echoing a pattern she could not see"), but minor register drift occurs when "fractally precise" shifts from embodied process to thematic abstraction during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong propulsion stumbles in high-pressure beats: "each particle placed with a fractally precise hand that seemed to echo the coin’s tiny grooves" stacks redundant modifiers, dulling the climax’s immediacy despite otherwise vivid rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blindness and sky-mirroring avoids tropes, but the "condemned building" framing edges toward safety-middle; risk-taking elevates stakes yet lacks one transformative detail (e.g., how demolition crew’s presence alters Lira’s choices).</comment>
