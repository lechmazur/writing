<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "meek" trait isn't tested under pressure. Motivation clear but bartered memory (failed forge) lacks visible cost or struggle during trade, weakening causal link to resilience. No genuine flaw complicates choices—success feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong early anchors ("orchard planet," "meek blacksmith" by word 30) avoid orientation penalty. Closure is Charged Poise (blade cracking stone into vines), but cost proof fails—the memory trade has no felt consequence beyond abstract "pulse like heartbeats." Misses Q2 9+ gate due to cost ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting dazzles with "sapphire fruit" and "copper grove," but orchard/arches remain decorative backdrop—they don’t constrain choices or charge closure. Micro-setting saves it: silk’s "wind caught in cotton" texture directly enables the final crystal-vine payoff, meeting 9+ gate via tool constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resilience via barter) signaled early, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening. Pressure grows passively—the stone "answered with a low hum," no struggle during tunnel traversal. Cost (memory trade) is told, not shown altering tactics; "quietly determined" trait faces no test, violating band guardrails for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through "bartered awakenings" motif, but "defiant heart" line in closure edges toward thematic echo. Avoids moralizing, yet final image’s crystal vines reweight rubble-as-hope without non-literal complexity—resonance feels slightly pat for 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice excels with "fruit hums" and forge-centric perception, but "mind a twin horizon of hope and doubt" slips into therapy-speak. Rhythmic control under pressure strong (e.g., "steps deliberate, each echo a reminder"), though minor register drift in "resonant agreement" mars consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("quietly determined" re: hammer/smile) and overwrought density ("twin horizon of hope and doubt") cause slight momentum drag. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "rubble pulse like heartbeats" repeats earlier metaphor, violating high-band line-level precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magician’s silk" trope via memory-for-future-strength barter, with "azure defiance" as fresh emotional lens. Avoids derivative safety, yet "meek blacksmith" archetype lacks sufficient personalization. Risk-taking in accumulative structure elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
