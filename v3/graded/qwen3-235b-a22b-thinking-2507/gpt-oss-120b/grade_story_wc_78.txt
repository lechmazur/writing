<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is clear but abstract, lacking embodied struggle or contradictory impulses. Prophet's interiority remains observational rather than conflicted under pressure, with no micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. Cost feels aesthetic rather than visceral, failing the 9+ test for earned causality with visible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise (orchard humming with "restless euphony") under Accumulative/Textural lens, with density increase through fractal patterns. But cost remains conceptual ("lingering hum") without concrete on-page price—no exact sentence where effort exacts physical or emotional toll, weakening the final image's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet functions as micro-setting object that constrains choices (striking rhythms) and charges closure ("wood now warm with memory"). Sensory details are purposefully selective—clouds mapped to sound, leaves as "muted cymbals"—with driftwood circle evolving causally as the prophet transforms its obstacles into instruments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes ("proving obstacles become instruments") deepen through cloud shifts (violet to amber to silver), but conflict lacks tangible opposition—the prophet faces no resistance beyond atmospheric changes. Escalation relies on environmental pressure rather than protagonist agency, with cost remaining abstract ("lingering hum") rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the prophet's actions: "harmony from obstacles" crystallizes in the final image of the orchard "humming with restless euphony." Avoids moralizing by showing rather than stating the transformation, with the "sketched resonance" concept reweighting the premise through concrete particulars like fruit swelling with bass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "clouds as hidden script" and "seaweed around driftwood circles," with rhythmic control modulating under pressure (syncopated strikes intensify syntax). Purposeful elision of backstory taught early pays off in the closure’s lyrical density, avoiding head-hopping while sustaining single-POV consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or action ("fractal patterns exploded outward, sending ripples of sound"). High density without muddle—"battered xylophone mallet, its wooden head worn smooth"—avoids purple prose while charging closure with "wood warm with memory." Minor "restless euphony" repetition stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific ("fractal generating patterns") and mystical ("Leeward tide prophet") tropes feels inevitable through specific details like dubbing rhythms onto mallet strikes. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes—orchard as "harmonious engine"—without obscuring clarity, transforming a universal theme through the prophet’s unique methodology.</comment>
