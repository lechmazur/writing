<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks interior contradiction; bellhop's silence is thematic symbol not embodied struggle. Guests remain undifferentiated collective. "Frostbitten hope" label replaces concrete emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure with legible cost ("safety demanded a price"). Orientation delayed past 120 words (no who/where anchors) caps score. Accumulative lens holds through bolt's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Piano bolt functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (bellhop's offering) and charges final image. Cobalt walls' cold actively pressures guests' safety dilemma. Sensory details filtered through bellhop's frost-veiled perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cost of safety) signaled early but nerve regeneration lacks tangible pressure. Bolt's transformation drives meaningful deepening, yet escalation isn't protagonist-driven; bellhop's action feels ritualistic not tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt's reweighted meaning: "safety's price was not measured in steel... but in willingness to bear silence." Final image resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised sapphire" walls, "seraphically mundane" bellhop) but "frostbitten hope" repetition creates tic. Tense/stance stable. Non-standard compression taught early (discoloration shifts) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Color metaphor stack ("bruised sapphire"/"amber"/"copper") in high-pressure beat dulls closure image. "Frostbitten hope" synonym churn triggers -0.4 artifact penalty. Strong verbs ("pulsed," "glinting") offset density issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mundane object (piano bolt) as beacon of hope. Risky structural choice (near-total silence) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Nerve regeneration concept feels derivative but transformed by cobalt fortress specificity.</comment>
