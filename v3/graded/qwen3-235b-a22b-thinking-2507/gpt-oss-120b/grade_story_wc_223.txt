<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "feign terror and still feel its teeth," but nomadic penumbra lacks clear pressure as secondary character despite thematic weight. Micro-choices (footfall patterns) credibly reveal historian motivation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: walking patterns deepen stakes toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "weight of gestures settle on her shoulders," though nomadic penumbra's mechanics slightly abstract the escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Whispering gallery constrains choice (dust for writing, echoes amplifying actions) and charges final image (scroll on dark squares). "Luminous absence" transforms setting into active constraint beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mira's patterns narrowing options (erasure → preservation), with felt cost in shoulder-weight. Agency clear but external opposition lacks teeth; conflict remains internalized without tangible resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "historian of small gestures" concept crystallizes in scroll placement without moralizing. Final image reweights "luminous absence" as possibility, avoiding thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless in dust-tracing details ("faint rustle of her shoes"), but "benevolently ruthless" label drifts into academic register twice. Rhythmic control under pressure elevates walking sequences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "secret script written on the world" charges closure without muddle. Minor deduction for dual "benevolently ruthless" repetition slightly diluting peak-beat immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of chessboard void as historical metaphor feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though nomadic penumbra borders on symbolic convenience without deeper transformation.</comment>
