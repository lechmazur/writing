<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("breath shallow") and motivation clear, but protagonist remains passive observer without contradictory impulses or flawed choices under pressure; the key realization lacks struggle, missing micro-choices that would earn closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight settle like dust"), but escalation lacks density increase—ghosts and box patterns accumulate without meaningful intensification of pressure or narrowing options, weakening Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Scorched oasis and stained glass box function as micro-setting that charges closure: the stone pedestal constrains alignment action, and fractured light directly reweights the covenant’s meaning with visceral specificity ("molten amber tear").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving covenant) is clear, but conflict lacks escalation—ghosts exert no pressure, and the single deepening (ruby line realization) doesn’t narrow options or raise cost until the final image, missing Accumulative lens density shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as preservation emerges purely through concrete action (box alignment) and final image ("tear of molten amber"), avoiding moralizing while reweighting "mute eloquence" into renewal without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calm of a stone lake," "breath shallow") and rhythmic control create meditative voice; syntactic variation mirrors recluse’s state, with patterned elision ("ghosts seemed to pause") taught early and paid off in closure’s cadence shift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "kaleidoscope of colors" achieves high density without muddle, though "memory of honey no longer sweet" slightly overwrites a high-pressure beat with redundant abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of apocalypse tropes through beekeeper covenant specificity; emotional truth in "guardian of silence" avoids sentimentality, with risk-taking quiet closure that heightens stakes through earned restraint.</comment>
