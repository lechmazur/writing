<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in methodical restorer embracing uncertainty, but flaws lack genuine struggle before shift; "realized that to exchange certainty" feels tell-y rather than earned through embodied conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("old certainty drift away"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase where each bell echo deepens vibration stakes without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sound wave garden pressures choices (whispering question, brush-tap reply) and micro-setting hobo nickel constrains action; final image of etched coin charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (certainty vs curiosity) tightens through Lena's brush-tap agency, but escalation leans passive until climax; visible cost in drifting certainty earns high band despite minimal middle development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (dissolving murals, curiosity-painted ripples), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "certainty vs wonder" with resonant ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("colored ribbons," "methodically playful") with rhythmic control, but "nested awakenings" repetition creates mechanical cadence in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor simultaneity error ("cascade of miniature auroras that painted") and template-like "nested awakenings" repetition; otherwise high density with no closure-obscuring artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound garden as curiosity metaphor avoids tropes through hobo nickel specificity; risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes but "awakenings" phrasing slightly dilutes originality.</comment>
