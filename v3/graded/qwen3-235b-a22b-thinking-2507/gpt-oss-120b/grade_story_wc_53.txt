<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses (wanting wonder vs accepting erosion) through concrete actions like aligning seashells, but Mara's ghost negotiation lacks escalation stakes—her "trade my regret" offer feels unearned without prior tactical cost, weakening the closure's causal weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the lagoon's stilled water and ghost's fading smile crystallize Mara's acceptance of eroded ambitions with conceptual cost ("sprouting fresh roots"), but underutilized chronology confusion creates a non-closure flaw (-0.8 cap) as it never constrains choices despite early prominence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon functions as essential micro-setting—Mara collects fragments from its surface, and its luminous arcs charge the finale by "applauding" her pact, directly constraining choices and reweighting the eroded ambitions theme through physical interaction rather than static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density (accumulating story fragments sharpening resolve), but Mara's agency falters—the ghost's memory offer lacks tangible cost, reducing the climax to thematic exchange rather than earned trade; the "regret" action shapes tension but doesn't visibly alter tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the seashell spiral and camera wheel conduit reconfigure "eroded ambitions" into "sprouting roots" without moralizing, while the final lagoon breath offers a resonant non-literal answer to Mara's loss of wonder, avoiding sentimentality through concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in phrases like "water ripple like a metallic heart," but "chronologically confused" leans tell-not-show early on; rhythmic control under pressure holds through the negotiation, though "quilt of regrets" risks overwriting without payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase looping ("each shard sharpened her resolve"/"each regret added weight") slightly dulls momentum, but high density prevails—every sentence advances atmosphere or character, and the final image ("world breathe as one") avoids cliché with precise textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms scavenger/ghost tropes via the kinetic lagoon's physics and camera wheel mechanics; the "eroded ambitions" concept gains freshness through lagoon-depth imagery and bittersweet resolution, though the carousel's silence echoes common decay motifs without radical reinvention.</comment>
