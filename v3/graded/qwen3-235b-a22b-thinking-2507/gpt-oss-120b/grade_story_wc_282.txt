<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but epiphany lacks contradictory impulses; "amplifying silence" realization feels unearned without visible struggle against prior assumptions during ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (caves singing/reconfigured meaning) with conceptual cost, but "factually mystical" label disrupts causal flow in critical beat where ritual mechanics should feel organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Coastal caves function as micro-setting that charges final image; mineral filaments/elm leaf veins constraining choices during ritual creates tangible pressure toward closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging memory) lacks meaningful tightening; cavern "breathing" to aid ritual crosses into coincidence resolving pressure rather than protagonist-driven escalation under textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through "voice of unknown" redefined as amplifying silence, but final epiphany statement edges toward thematic echo without sufficient prior tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scent/pressure mapping) persists under pressure; rhythmic control in vapor droplet sequence demonstrates voice modulation without elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" register drift in high-stakes ritual beat triggers -0.4 penalty; otherwise zero loops with exceptional textural specificity in heat-mapping descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms hibernation trope through sensory cartography premise; "transitional object" concept made specific via mineral/vein alignment that charges closure image.</comment>
