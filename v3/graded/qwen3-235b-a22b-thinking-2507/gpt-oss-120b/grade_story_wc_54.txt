<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority leans abstract ("functionally creative" as label not demonstrated); final choice lacks visible cost—smiling departure forecloses no path. No contradictory impulses shown during pivotal rerouting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with terminal's hum, but conceptual cost of resurrected hope remains oblique ("quiet anthem" feels unearned). Orientation clear early; Accumulative lens holds with density increase in conduit rerouting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sextant constrains choices (calibrating voltage flow) and charges final image (moon-aligned vibration). Terminal's "main artery" conduit actively shapes tactics, avoiding white-room syndrome with tactile engineering details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("resurrect hope"), but escalation lacks earned struggle—"careful calculations" handwaves challenge. No visible price paid; agency feels untested despite "maze of intentions" pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (equations on metal scrap), avoiding moralizing. Final beacon reweights carnival's departure as "lasting framework," with no thematic echo—cost implied via "dormant communication array" seeking distant wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("conduits like fluid," "carnival lights faint in dust") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift: "functionally creative" jargon clashes with lyrical voice during sextant alignment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold: "echo of departing carnival lights" paraphrased later as "carnival's departure emptied the town." No closure artifacts; high density in conduit rerouting beats sustains propulsion without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering precision and emotional resonance ("sextant as compass for ethical currents"). Avoids safety middle with "stoic wonder" tone, though "resurrect hope" premise risks abstraction without terminal's tactile revival.</comment>
