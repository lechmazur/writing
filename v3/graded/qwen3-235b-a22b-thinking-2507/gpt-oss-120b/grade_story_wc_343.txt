<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's "diligently curious" trait manifests concretely in tracing diagonals and journal rhythm, but lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the quiet pride resolution feels earned yet the emotional cost remains abstract without tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the halo's intensification and engine sync crystallize options with visible cost in Lira's "quiet pride that balanced the sociable isolation," fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through pattern-density escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hopscotch board constrains choices (tracing diagonals aligns symbols with light) and charges the final image (silver threads wrapping copper veins), meeting the 9+ gate where micro-setting directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes ("harness luminance without draining ship") lack escalation; pressure never narrows options as Lira succeeds effortlessly, weakening cost legibility despite the warm presence replacing isolation feeling earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "stranded luminance" evolving from metaphor to functional beacon, with starlings' final formation shift offering resonant, non-literal answer to "sociable isolation" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in light-pattern observations ("amber breath," "choir of distant birds"), though repetitive "she traced/she noted" cadence slightly dulls mid-scene pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("humming grew steadier" repeated) and three consecutive "she" openings in climax prevent 9+, but propulsion remains strong with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes through specific mechanics (hopscotch as cartographic tool, starlings as light carriers), though the flawless success lacks the bold risk-taking required for 9+ distinction.</comment>
