<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("combative tenderness" as label without embodied contradiction); epiphany about "battle fought with kindness" feels unearned despite strong micro-choice with backwards walking. Nervous habit reveals character-specific stress response effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when light cascade heals walls, with visible cost in archivist's expended energy (nervous habit resurfacing then steadying). Late crystallization of "reversible exile" as operational stake causes minor escalation drag in middle section.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tea leaves function as micro-setting that constrains choices (decoding dates) and charges the final image (map revelation). Dust and afternoon shadow evolve causally with events, mirroring internal states through action like "dust swirling in graceful eddies" during reassembly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize too late; "reversible exile" remains thematic echo until tea-leaf decoding. Escalation lacks causal pressure under Accumulative lens—shadow fracture feels coincidental rather than archivist's active choice, undermining agency in pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme resonates through "resilience" reconfiguration via tea-leaf cartography, but "resilience, once mentored quietly, would now roar back" triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Final image reweights exile as "reversible pilgrimage" without stating moral, though sentimentality mars emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dust like ancient whispers" and tea-leaf geometry analysis. Rhythmic control excels under pressure ("ribbons of gold" fracturing light), though "combative tenderness" repetition slightly flattens voice modulation during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Near-cliché "breathed a sigh of relief" in final paragraph triggers -0.3 deduction. Otherwise strong propulsion with purposeful compression ("vaulted ceiling lifting like a chest relieved of a long-held breath"), though "geometry of tea leaves" borders on thesaurus-itis without sufficient payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tea-leaf cartography transforms "reversible exile" trope through specific, grounded choice. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (-0.7) as core concept lacks fresh moral calculus; "Endure, then return" feels templated despite strong integration with pentagon symbolism.</comment>
