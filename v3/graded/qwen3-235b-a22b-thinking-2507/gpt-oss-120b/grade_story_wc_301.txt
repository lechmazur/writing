<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rich but "daringly methodical" remains abstract trait rather than embodied contradiction; medication withdrawal's physical impact lacks visceral specificity despite strong micro-choices like tracing graffiti.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully in final promise to stones, with cost legible in "raw solace" as quiet acceptance; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through river-graffiti-accordion resonance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ivy, river, and patched accordion actively constrain choices—bellows' tape stitching the coat to stone charges the final image; sensory hierarchy (rust/rain/whispering leaves) mirrors emotional progression flawlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes in self-forgiveness deepen through bathroom graffiti to river confession, but medication withdrawal's urgency lacks tangible escalation; cost ("fragile stone I dared to keep") feels earned yet insufficiently pressured by the timeline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river's "truthful" refusal to hide and mud-map drawing; final image reweights "forgiveness as river" without moralizing, avoiding the penalty for "raw solace" as earned wisdom rather than platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chronicled for years," "map references on a page") sustains lyrical compression; only minor register drift in "cartography of the soul" momentarily strains the river chronicler's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-perfect propulsion with purposeful fragments ("a sigh that resonated with the river’s own murmur"), but adjacent synonym loops ("daringly methodical" x3) and "crooked lines, as if the wall itself were a compass" slightly dilute density in mid-beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of river chronicler + accordion bellows creates organic metaphor; risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through mud-map drawing, transforming "truth-seeking" from occupation to embodied pilgrimage without gimmickry.</comment>
