<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear through "tyranny of indifference" but "underestimated rebel" label risks stock phrasing; micro-choices like pocketing warm key reveal resourcefulness without over-articulation. Interior contradiction ("quiet smile masking fierce resolve") feels earned though emotional progression lacks deeper friction beyond resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: key's final glimmer promises future resistance with visible cost ("battle would be long"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; "liquid memory" reflections create coherent pressure without causality breaks. Orientation anchors firmly by paragraph one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Auric lagoon constrains choices (navigation via reflections) and charges final image ("lagoon whispering approval"). Sensory hierarchy excels—starlight on ripples, cool metal key—but "molten gold" verges on cliché despite context. Micro-setting (puddle reflections) directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fighting indifference) tightens via transmitter activation; Mara's whisper forces rulers to "confront ghosts" with conceptual cost. Pressure escalates through accumulating sensory density (ripples → broadcast → citizen hope), though secondary cost to Mara remains slightly abstract beyond "long battle."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "coded ripples" not moralizing; final image ("lagoon whispering approval") reweights "revised histories" as organic resistance. Avoids thematic echo by embedding "tyranny of indifference" in action (regime ignoring ghosts), though "seed in cracks of stone" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "scattered coins" of starlight and "cracked walls" reflecting routes. Rhythmic control under pressure ("whispered coded phrase") avoids uniformity. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing but overall voice stays grounded in tactile details.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with "salvaged phone booth key—still warm" doing triple duty, but "phantom fireflies" edges stock metaphor. Zero loops; final third ("glittering waves") avoids overwriting through motif cohesion. "Liquid memory" metaphor sustains physical logic without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "rebel with key" trope through puddle-reflection navigation and "coded freedom" as ripple physics. Emotional truth in "dormant hopes reappearing" avoids generic defiance. Risk-taking (water as living map) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity of "defunct company" salvaged parts anchors freshness.</comment>
