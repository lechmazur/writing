<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation ("chemistry of homecoming") drives action, but interior contradiction is underdeveloped; no visible struggle between skepticism and awe during pivotal vibration moment weakens earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("home was not a place but a pattern"), but the felt cost of "surge of belonging" lacks concrete embodiment in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower/moss/rain constrain choices (amber on slab, prisms from droplets) and charge the final image ("shining with faint inner light"), meeting 9+ gate for micro-setting shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when vibration matches amber's rhythm, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Arin's passive observation during convergence undermines pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "chemistry of homecoming" as dialogue, avoiding moralizing; final line reweights "home" as curiosity's pattern without stated moral, achieving Q5 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous skeptic," "bronze quiet") and rhythmic control during vibration beat; no head-hopping, with elision of scholars' dialogue taught through sensory focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "bronze quiet" repetition (4x) risks tic; final paragraph's "promise that home could be rebuilt" slightly overwrites the earned image, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of first contact through chemistry-of-return lens; "fly amber" as contact tool transforms trope with specific, verifiable detail that avoids generic universality.</comment>
