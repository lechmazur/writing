<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; vandalized portrait triggers no visceral struggle despite past sins. Micro-choices absent during key decisions like setting the blaze, weakening earned redemption. Strength: embodied tracing of glyphs mirrors internal reckoning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (reborn mural crystallizes guardian stance with felt cost in "past judged his earlier sins"). Accumulative lens holds through pattern recognition, but "volcanic tenderness" borders on thematic echo, slightly muddying cost legibility at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Archive murals and basalt dome create vivid atmosphere ("dust danced like ash"), yet setting remains backdrop rather than active constraint. Misses 9+ gate: no environmental/tool pressure on choices (e.g., tapestry "fit perfectly" without friction).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes clear (protect stories), but escalation lacks protagonist agency; clues solve problems passively. "Controlled blaze" decision shows moral calculus, yet no tightening of options—path feels preordained, weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through phoenix imagery and "stories traded like fire," avoiding moralizing. Final mural reweights premise with conceptual cost, but "volcanic tenderness" repetition risks sentimentality, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading silent equations of color as fire equations") shines, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages. Register drift occurs when "analytically intuitive" feels like label, not lived experience, during high-pressure discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong density in opening, but "volcanic tenderness" repetition creates paraphrase loop (3x), and "fierce love tempered by gentle heat" mixes incompatible metaphors. Closure beat weakened by figurative muddle despite vivid phrasing like "murals spread like lava."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist/librarian duality and "smoke signal to guide mind" elevates trope. Yet phoenix imagery lacks transformation, and redemption arc feels familiar despite poetic execution—emotional specificity insufficient to fully transcend template.</comment>
