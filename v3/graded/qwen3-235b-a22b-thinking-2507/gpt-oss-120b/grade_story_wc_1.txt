<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (trembling yet steady) manifest in physical choices like following frost. Epiphany about "purpose in pauses" is earned through glass refraction imagery, though "steadily adaptive" label risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: melted frost reveals path, but the fire's ashes remain a "scorched testament." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned frost/ledger recurrence, though coincidence in ledger discovery slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Canyon walls as "glass towers" constrain movement and charge the finale—frost patterns literally guide her path, while basalt grooves enable the hidden route. Micro-setting (frost veins) directly alters tactics and reweights the final image with rebirth symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when frost melts to reveal the path, narrowing options to one hidden route. Cost (fire's destruction) is visible early but lacks visceral felt weight in climax; "purpose" realization feels earned yet slightly abstract without tangible physical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: frost melting into grooves, glass humming with heartbeat. Final image ("frost returned in delicate veins") reweights loss as rebirth without moralizing—no thematic echo, only earned resonance through the canyon's teaching.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: glass artist notices "light fracture" and "amber pulse." Rhythm modulates from "glassy hush" to "glass sang," with patterned "drifting resonance" taught early and paid off. Minor deduction for one elevated phrase ("steadily adaptive") breaking POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "scorched testament" metaphor evolves meaningfully. Deduction for "drifting resonance" repetition (4x), muddying peak beats. Final line ("glimmered like molten glass") avoids overwriting—textural specificity elevates without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "artist reborn" trope through smuggler’s ledger/frost mechanics. Fresh synthesis: charcoal trade routes become artistic rebirth map. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the canyon’s quiet teaching feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
