<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in dismissing grandiose visions while pursuing intimate connection, but motivation ("texture of connection") remains abstract without embodied cost beyond sensory description; "powerfully gentle" trait lacks visible tradeoffs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("effort of sustaining connection" implied in lingering echo), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural dominates yet "questioning assumptions" suggests Causal framing, weakening causality proof at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Golden shadows and carbide lens charge final image ("light dimmed, leaving reverberations"), but micro-setting (chimes/lens) doesn’t constrain choices—e.g., no tactical shift when lamp lowers; specificity excels yet misses 9+ gate for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen accumulatively (each chime blurs light/sound divide), yet cost remains diffuse—"texture of connection settling like dust" lacks visceral, on-page price; agency drives escalation but without concrete forfeiture altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "synaptic sparks" and "hand reaching across void," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights pilgrimage as daily ritual, but "texture of connection" risks thematic echo without sharper embodied cost in closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("velvety hum that caressed the air," "fingertips brushing worn stone"); rhythmic control modulates with pressure—e.g., cadence shift at "golden shadows dancing to rhythm of discovery"—with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("room filled with low hum" → "cascade of synaptic sparks"), but scaffold appears in "powerfully gentle in their touch" (telling vs. showing) and "texture of connection" phrase risks thematic echo in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis of sensory fusion (carbide lens fracturing light into "audible ribbons") feels inevitable; bold quiet closure rejects grandiosity for "daily ritual," heightening stakes through specificity of "synthetic pilgrimage" mechanics.</comment>
