<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in atlas work ("marginal notes could tilt balance") but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear though "worrying tranquility" borders on label-speak without sufficient embodied tension during key decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("ice sang, and the world listened") under Accumulative lens, but cost proof slightly oblique; condensation-to-transmitter sequence tightens meaning without causal loopholes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Frozen lake and glass pane micro-setting constrain choices (heat-revealed symbols, transmitter alignment) and charge the final vein-of-water image; sensory details reflect urgency without checklist performativity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (rivers' origin) deepen through atmospheric pressure, but "after falcon returns" timeframe lacks live-clock tension; agency in Mara's transmitter action feels earned though escalation leans slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Kaltwasser" revelation and final water vein—no moralizing—but "ice born from silence" risks near-platitude; conceptual repricing avoids sentimentality via concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dry-witted," atlas-editor lexicon) modulates rhythm under pressure; "cracked spine cracking like a tiny gun" exemplifies voice-coherent metaphor without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density issues ("worrying tranquility settle over her" slightly overwritten) but zero loops; final line’s cadence shift ("ice sang, and the world listened") achieves high-propulsion closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms exploration tropes via atlas-editor specificity and condensation mechanics; "phrasebook as herald" risks cliché but redeemed by transmitter glyph integration, avoiding derivative middle-ground.</comment>
