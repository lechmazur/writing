<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo’s internal contradiction (rebellious duty) drives choices with embodied cost; "weight of rebellion ease into quiet purpose" shows earned endurance without tidy resolution. Minor deduction for limited interaction depth with rival pilot beyond nod.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: drones crossing paths crystallizes fragile peace while "weight of rebellion" easing proves felt trade-off. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density buildup to storm’s release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade’s neon directly pressures tactics (dimming enables envelope slip) and charges closure; bottle’s transformation from "roiling clouds" to "calm sky" constrains choices and reweights final image. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Milo’s agency under Accumulative lens: bottle’s static intensifies to flash that forces drone retreat, narrowing options to truce. Cost legible in "weight of rebellion" easing—a visible trade-off for peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of healing through "linking absences" emerges from concrete actions (envelope’s "honor the voids"), not moralizing. Final image reweights storm as "quiet thunder" offering resonant, non-literal answer to broken promises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("neon hummed," storm’s "electric sigh") with rhythmic control under pressure; sentence cadence shifts from lyrical ("coat flapping like surrender") to clipped during drone confrontation. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("clinking token" anchors scene economically). Metaphors coherent ("storm erupted in flash that blinded optics"), final line recharges motif without muddle. Propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Linking absences" transforms mailman trope into fresh inflection—specific to arcade’s context. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes; emotional truth in quiet resolution avoids cliché. Synthesis feels inevitable.</comment>
