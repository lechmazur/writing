<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped (no visible internal conflict during climax); "trembling fingers" shows embodied emotion but lacks layered irrationality. Strength: actions like tucking the cracked crown reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is flawless causal Decisive Change: the crown-touch triggers sundering, exposing the pretender with undeniable conceptual cost (temple's collapse as lie's dissolution). Orientation is immediate; every beat links through "because/therefore" without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Temple library functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (shelves "melt into walls," papyrus scent signaling collapse) and charges the final image (stones' "hymn of graceful collapse"). Spent ink pellet's spilled essence sealing truth into stone elevates tool-as-setting beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: ink pellet decoding forces movement through cryptic messages, culminating in the crown-touch that narrows options to truth/revelation. Cost is visceral (temple destruction) and conceptual (sovereignty stripped), unmistakable in "ceiling bowed in graceful collapse."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "power taken by deceit crumbles" reweighted by final image of stones singing "lament for the lost but also promise of renewal." Avoids moralizing; no character articulates the thesis, satisfying the non-literal answer requirement without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("rune of drift pulsed beneath it," "air heavy with scent of old papyrus") with rhythmic control under pressure (short, fractured sentences during collapse: "Cracks spidered outward"). Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during the sundering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ink spread like a slow tide" avoids cliché while advancing plot. Final line "turned treachery into dust" crystallizes theme with high density. No figurative muddle in peak beats—collapse sequence uses concrete verbs ("spidered," "bowed," "mourned") without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "library guardian" trope through specific, grounded choices: iron gall ink pellet as truth-telling device and "rune of drift" mechanics feel inevitable. Risk-taking (elegant collapse as thematic resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "diminutive titan" borders slightly on archetype.</comment>
