<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trauma-as-method but "remembering through trauma responses" lacks embodied cost early on; micro-choices like bracing against bark feel earned though the interrogation backstory summary risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the strap's transformation, but the ultraviolet penance escalation lacks causal linkage—light flashes feel ritualistic rather than narrowing options until the crystal roots climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest functions as vital micro-setting: its pulses constrain choices (proprioceptive pathfinding) and charge the final image when ordinary moss replaces violet light, making environment inseparable from thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory cost (light searing skin), yet the "mathematics of mercy" revelation lacks meaningful escalation—the crystal roots climax emerges abruptly without sufficient pressure buildup from prior bracing moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through the strap's evolution from shackle to beacon, but Lira's whispered equation risks thematic echo; saved by immediate embodied consequence (light softening) that reweights prior suffering without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "lattice of bruised memories" and proprioceptive phrasing, though tense shifts ("she recalled"/"she wondered") momentarily fracture psychic distance during high-pressure beats near the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she braced") cluster in pivotal beats like the crystal roots revelation, dulling immediacy; otherwise lush prose with rhythmic control earns points but caps high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of interrogation trauma and ecological mysticism feels fresh, yet ultraviolet forest leans on familiar speculative tropes; elevated by the strap's irreplaceable role in transforming "mathematics of mercy" from abstraction to embodied truth.</comment>
