<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>No contradictory impulses under pressure; traits like "richly perceptive" remain stated not demonstrated with trade-offs. Closure choice (singing lament) lacks prior causality—unmotivated by internal struggle despite clear external goal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density increase (child's laughter → lover's sigh → lattice), but cost at closure ("quiet ache") is abstract, not legible on-page. No exact image anchors the price paid for dissolving echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Whispering seashell functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (urgency to sing before dawn) and charges final image (whole shell humming). Lattice projection in cavern decisively shapes the ending's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through progressive disclosure, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the canyon "reveals" layers passively. Cost at closure (echoes released) is conceptual but not felt; no visible price alters her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ending reweights echoes as "bridges to the living" through the whole shell's hum—a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; thematic complexity ("unfinished promises") emerges organically from the lattice revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hearing subtlest vibrations in stone") and rhythmic control ("voice threading the night") shine. Minor register drift in "dormant fireflies" cliché slightly undermines pressure in cavern scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High density with vivid "quartz light" imagery, but stacked modifiers ("trembling chord," "luminous threads") in climax risk figurative muddle. No scaffold loops, though "serpentine nexus" feels ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echoes as emotional residue transforms familiar tropes. Bold Accumulative structure risks clarity but pays off—canyon's "ancient grief" resolving into "bridges" feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
