<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirela’s motivation to measure swallowed truth is clear and embodied (“stone in chest”), with contradictory impulses (clarity vs. sorrow) driving micro-choices like smudging ink. Interiority avoids stock phrasing but internal conflict lacks active friction in pivotal beats; fever’s lesson remains abstract rather than compounding choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: console’s weight-matching number makes emotional shift legible. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (“humidity gradient,” trembling barometer”), but orientation anchors slightly past 120 words weaken causality tightness for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Weather station and botanical illustration constrain choice (smudging margins alters data) and charge closure (folded paper carried into wind). Micro-setting specificity—cold glass, antennae swaying like vines—makes environment indispensable to the final image’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory deepening (“ink bled, faint lines emerged”) narrows options under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the console’s truth-weight revelation. Agency-driven pressure lacks one concrete trade-off; barometer adjustment’s stakes feel conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through smudged illustration’s evolution—truth’s weight shifts from burden to “cloud that knows density”—without moralizing. Final aurora image (“sorrow lights the path”) reweights sorrow as beautiful cost, avoiding tidy resolution while deepening the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“chlorophyll tones,” “auroral sorrow”) and rhythmic control under pressure (“needle tremble sang a note”) showcase voice as character. Oracle’s technical lexicon (“fault-tolerant algorithms”) integrates seamlessly, modulating intensity without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; “peripherally aware” slightly jars as corporate diction but fits oracle POV. Final beat (“weight seemed to lift”) achieves high density without muddle, though “swaying certainties” repetition edges toward scaffold in mid-section.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of botanical art and oracle tech feels inevitable, transforming “swallowed truth” into measurable weight. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry; specificity (“pine sap lie”) avoids derivative abstraction.</comment>
