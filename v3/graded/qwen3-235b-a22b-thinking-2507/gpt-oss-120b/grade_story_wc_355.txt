<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority relies on poetic labels ("theatrical sincerity," "intuitively descriptive") without embodied contradiction; no visible cost to empathy quest beyond abstract "pulse of stories." Flawed by diagnostic phrasing in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: fireworks moment crystallizes stakes with felt cost ("collective breath released"). Orientation anchors early; lens consistent from midpoint with density escalation via vibrational cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Workshop functions as micro-setting constraining choices (crystal plates, locked clasp); "tarnished silver" recharges final image with cost. Sensory hierarchy vividly filters urgency through pacifist’s perception ("ripples of copper, lavender").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early (cataloging silence for empathy) but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; tuning method appears late without middle development. Cost ("unheard stories being heard") resonates but isn’t tethered to prior tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (midnight roses, battlefield hush) but final paragraph’s "whispered promise that every silence would someday find its voice" commits Thematic Echo, undermining earned resonance with moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vibrations as ripples of copper") with rhythmic control; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure. Minor register drift ("intuitively descriptive") slightly fractures POV lexicon during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Overwriting in peak beats ("walls expanding like lungs prepared for a collective exhale") creates mixed metaphor; scaffold phrasing ("moved with theatrical sincerity, bowing...") dulls immediacy. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Synthesizes "empathy through silence" with fresh specificity (cataloged silences as "hush of sunrise over a battlefield"), but "locked diary clasp" trope lacks transformation. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
