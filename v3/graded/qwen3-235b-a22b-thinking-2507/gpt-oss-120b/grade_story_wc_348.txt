<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("loosened grief rise, not as a weight but as a gentle release") and micro-choices under pressure, but contradictory impulses lack sufficient simultaneity; grief-to-purpose arc feels slightly tidy without deeper irrationality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: the bridge's pulse embodies "loosened grief" while the child's chrysalis gift crystallizes the cycle of loss/reconnection. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly through foam-to-polymer progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The river foam functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—it guides scaffold construction and directly charges the final image ("bridge pulsed faintly, echoing the rhythm"). Recurring bubbles evolve from observation to recorded data.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Mara's agency: her foam tracing sparks the lattice insight, which she physically implements. The "translucent bridge" reweights the dominant stake (failure→connection) with undeniable conceptual cost in the chrysalis' transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—foam lattice, bridge, chrysalis—not abstraction. Final image ("child... slipped a stray chrysalis shell") offers resonant non-literal answer: "every ending bears the seed of a fresh composition" avoids moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("heard the wind's gusts as movements in a grand score") and rhythmic control shine, though "symphonically minded" exposition slightly over-explains early without immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frosted the canyon with foam that rose and fell in rhythmic arches" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in DNA simile ("twisting like intertwined strands") but redeemed by later specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science and natural patterns feels inevitable—foam as lattice blueprint avoids cliché. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, as the bridge's pulse crystallizes emotional logic.</comment>
