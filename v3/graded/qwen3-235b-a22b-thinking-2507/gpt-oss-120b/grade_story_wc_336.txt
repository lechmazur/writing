<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>No interior contradiction or earned transformation; motivation ("preserve wonder") lacks friction with cost. "Insatiably creative" appears as label without testing under pressure. Traveler's arrival too late for relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is valid Charged Poise (garden as living chorus) but cost remains conceptual ("sorrow transmuted") without specific price paid by pruner. Lens ambiguity: shifts from causal (seed cracking) to accumulative (spore dispersal) without clear midpoint anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Waterfall mist enables seed germination but doesn't constrain choices; parapet remains postcard backdrop. Micro-setting (seed pool) charges closure via luminous spores, yet environment fails to shape tactics during storm resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("preserve wonder") declared but never viscerally tested; storm threat resolved via convenient singing without narrowing options. Traveler's arrival is coincidental complication, not protagonist-driven escalation. Missing visible trade-off for "succor" action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (luminous spores, transmuted storm rain) avoiding moralizing. Final image ("hope blossomed anew") reweights "color of wonder" with conceptual cost, though secondary stake ("distant gardens") remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (light/sound focus) with rhythmic control, but filter-verb stacks ("he sensed," "he felt") weaken immediacy in high-pressure beats. Voice contamination via "radiant hush" repetition dilutes tension during storm sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose loops weaken closure: "radiant hush" repeated 3x in final paragraph. "Succor" synonym-churn (4 uses) creates scaffold without pressure. Final line summary ("hope blossomed anew") dulls the earned image of glyph-imprinted rain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of horticulture and multiverse via "stitching realms" metaphor. Emotional truth in "weary saplings yearning for wonder" avoids fantasy tropes. Transformation test passed: generic "farmer" would collapse the premise's specificity.</comment>
