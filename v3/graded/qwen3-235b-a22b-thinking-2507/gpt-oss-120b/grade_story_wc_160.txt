<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses (engineer precision vs. empathic decoding) drive her micro-choices under pressure, with the elder's arrival crystallizing stakes through visible cost. "Slyly heartfelt" motivation is embodied in adhesive analysis and valve connection, though trait-label risks slight abstraction. Final choice earns unity via chain clasp with tangible emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as water flow becomes "conversation," reconfiguring the stake with undeniable cost in the elder's trembling doubts. Accumulative lens holds through binary pulse escalation narrowing options to harmonic balance. Cost proof lands in "doubts tremble into silence" amid ash alignment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dormant volcano amphitheater functions as active micro-setting: its "breath" constrains Mira's timing while the surveyor's chain charges the final image through clasp symbolism. Basalt floor tremors and adhesive residue directly shape decoding tactics, avoiding postcard description through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preservation vs. progress) tightens via Mira's adhesive-to-binary discovery, forcing trade-offs in valve adjustment. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the elder's shifted stance and "ash settling" as conceptual price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: water as "sapphire thread" reweights "conquest" into "conversation" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant CR where "encrypted compassion" becomes operationalized empathy, avoiding thematic echo through the chain's living ledger and ash-particle score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's machinist perceptual signature filters details ("pressure points," "bronze wheel") with rhythmic control from "muted drums" to "lullaby." Purposeful compression in glue-refraction beat teaches pattern early, paying off in binary pulses without head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor sensory repetition ("stone walls trembled"/"tremble into silence") creates a 0.2 loop deduction. Otherwise high density with propulsion: "rustled links singing," "ash particles aligning like ancient score" avoid muddle. Final line’s "ongoing encrypted compassion" achieves clarity without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering and empathy transforms "technology vs. nature" tropes through specific machinery (floodgate valve, surveyor's chain). Risk-taking in making technical processes lyrical heightens stakes without gimmickry, with adhesive analysis feeling inevitable through volcanic city logic.</comment>
