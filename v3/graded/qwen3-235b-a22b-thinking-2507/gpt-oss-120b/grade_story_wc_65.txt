<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction and embodied emotion lacking; "humbled by his own ignorance" is abstract label without specific struggle during modeling. No micro-choices under pressure—success feels unearned as predictions work flawlessly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: cartographer’s humility crystallizes cost ("humbled by his own ignorance") while transformed spire charges the final image. Causal lens holds tightly from lattice diagram to barley harvest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Frozen lake and obsidian spire create vivid atmosphere but fail to constrain choices—barley rows "echoed the lattice" shows thematic resonance, not causal pressure. Misses 9+ gate as setting doesn’t alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant famine stake signaled early, but escalation lacks friction; scholars’ skepticism resolves off-page ("agreed to test"), and no visible cost paid during implementation. Pressure tightens via model predictions but agency feels frictionless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (ignorance as "canvas"), but final paragraph’s explicit moral—"true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know"—triggers -0.6 thematic echo penalty, undermining earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("groundedly imaginative," "mythic birds") and rhythmic control shine, though "humbled" slips into abstraction. Voice modulates effectively from mythic dawn to technical modeling without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "groundedly imaginative" repetition; otherwise clean propulsion. Final line ("bright horizon of a transformed people") recharges motifs without muddle, but "blank page bounded by ice" slightly echoes earlier phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" premise transforms tropes via crystal contraption and kingfisher quill, but flawless execution lacks genuine struggle—no meaningful obstacles test the concept, muting emotional risk.</comment>
