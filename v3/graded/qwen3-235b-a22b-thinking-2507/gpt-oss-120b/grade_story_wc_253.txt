<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on abstract labels ("emotional void," "hollow") rather than embodied contradiction; micro-choices lack visible tradeoffs despite moral ambiguity. Final renunciation feels earned but prior causality for her "quiet transformation" remains underdeveloped in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: "silence that now seemed less imposed" reconfigures the remade hush under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens through sensory density (turbine hum, shavings) rather than plot turns, but one decisive deepening suffices for length. Cost legible in hollow-as-purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Turbines and cedar block function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure ("shadows racing... as if to chase emptiness"). Sensory details avoid cliché through character-specific filtering ("grief could be fragrant as well as heavy"), making environment indispensable to the final image's resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (expressing grief under joy mandate) signaled early; Accumulative pressure intensifies via sensory accumulation (shavings, turbine hum) culminating in baton completion. Agency through quiet creation lacks overt reversal but deepens knowledge, with cost felt in "hollow that could be filled." One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: dried flowers holding decay-stories, whittling as "carving lightness." Final image ("silence that now seemed less imposed") offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the mandate's oppression through art's quiet coexistence with grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shavings fell like snow in a world that no longer remembered winter") and rhythmic control shine, though "morally ambiguous performer" slightly tells. Elision of other characters taught early pays off in solitude, but minor register drift in "cultivate lightness" slightly undermines voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops in final third ("remade hush" repeated with minimal variation) and slight overwriting ("soft pulse of a remade hush") dull closure's edge. Figurative language remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle despite high density in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "happiness mandate" trope through specific, grounded choices: whittling as resistance, grief's fragrance. Avoids derivative safety by committing to quiet art over rebellion, with emotional truth in "decay could hold a story." Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
