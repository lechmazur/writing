<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority remains observational; lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro-choices (mirror arrangement) reveal dedication yet omit internal friction. No visible cost to character beyond physical effort. Final endurance feels unearned without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with cost (ferocious storm vs. fragile dawn), but causal thinness in Accumulative lens weakens escalation. Lens inferred early and held, yet pressure lacks meaningful tightening—rallying clans occurs off-page. Orientation anchors within 120 words, avoiding penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (mirror alignment, copper coils) and charges the final image. Sensory details (ozone, oil) are purposeful and POV-filtered. Avoids white-room syndrome through tactile navigation of environment. Final sunrise reweights shadows as essential tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forging variant allegiance) signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. Pressure grows through atmospheric density rather than tactical narrowing—copper coils' success feels coincidental. Cost (storm's ferocity) is visceral but not directly tied to choices. One deepening (radio frequencies unfolding rebellion) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (shadows as lanterns), avoiding moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to "ancient darkness forging hope." Minor thematic echo in "covenant" phrasing slightly undermines subtlety. Emotional aftereffect lingers via sensory specificity (ozone, prismatic bars).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in selective storm observations ("jagged lightning sketch patterns"). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure (fragmented radio vs. sunrise cadence). Avoids head-hopping with clean single-POV focus. Slight register drift in "lyrically prophetic" repetitions reduces consistency under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in climax ("heart a steady drum of gritty whimsy") triggers overwriting penalties in final third. Paraphrase loops on "variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows" dull immediacy. Strong opening/final lines anchor momentum, but template cadence in mirror-arrangement beats impedes propulsion. Artifacts prevent 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes "variant allegiance" trope through specific stormlit mechanics, avoiding generic revolution narratives. Emotional truth in visionary's quiet resolve feels fresh, yet prophet trope lacks transformation. Bold risk in Accumulative structure heightens stakes but proximity to familiar "light-from-darkness" arcs caps originality. No safety-hedging in moral ambiguity.</comment>
