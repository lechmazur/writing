<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interiority lacks contradiction; no struggle during sealing despite years of effort. 'Translating heartbeats' borders on thematic echo but remains embodied. Final covenant feels earned yet uncomplicated by flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: covenant crystallizes options with felt cost ('seal holds only as long as she tends'). Accumulative lens holds through pattern density; orchard's shiver charges final cost. Minor slip: no visible consequence during sealing act weakens immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard functions as micro-setting: frost-kissed roots and dead trees constrain material choices (fragile glass, ash mound). Final image ('trees standing as sentinels') charges closure by embodying devotion. Subarctic crater deepens stakes through implied cold but lacks active pressure during key beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sealing starlight) lacks concrete on-page test; 'world holding breath' urgency remains abstract without narrowing options. Escalation relies on internal rhythm, not external pressure. Cost (lifelong tending) is conceptual but not viscerally felt during the sealing act itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through 'cartography of love and loss' rendered in light. Final image ('moving stillness settle like snowfall') reweights patience as gentle steps without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in framing endurance as covenant rather than triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: 'fingers moving like glacier ice,' 'bark creaking like old song.' Rhythmic control under pressure intensifies during sealing ('whispered... flared... burst'). Zero head-hopping; syntax modulates perfectly from tense precision to calm resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: 'cascade of quiet fire' binds action/image without overwriting. Minor density risk in 'luminous veins' metaphor but payoff in heartbeat mapping justifies it. 'Moving stillness' repetition functions as intentional lyric motif, not scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alchemy/emotional cartography synthesis feels fresh and inevitable. 'Flash-paper alchemist' transforms trope through specific stakes (fragile starlight seals). Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens coherence; no derivative safety-hedging in the covenant's irreversible cost.</comment>
