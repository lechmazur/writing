<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (refusing faces vs. awakening empathy) drives key choices; "pressed the brush harder" shows micro-choice with cost. Slightly underdeveloped backstory on why empathy was sealed, but embodied emotion ("tremor of dormant empathy") avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: stone tear glinting like "promise fulfilled" crystallizes cost of remembrance under Accumulative lens. Fissure revealing carvings risks coincidence but serves pressure intensification; cost ("dormant empathy awaken fully") is legible on final page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry constrains choices (sound swallowed, mist limiting light) and charges closure (stone tear). Ribbon fragment evolves from talisman to evidence-carrier; micro-setting (limestone slab) directly shapes Mara's tracing action. Environment meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening empathy for cold cases) tightens when ribbon reveals child's name, forcing Mara's physical/emotional escalation. Cost (reclaiming sorrow) is visceral but quarry's fissure response edges toward coincidence under Accumulative lens; agency remains Mara's.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (truth in feeling absence) emerges through void-eyed portrait and stone tear—no moralizing. Final image reweights "unifying opposites" as earned wisdom: "silence forever altered" avoids tidy resolution while charging prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingertips sensing grain of sand," "furrowed hush") filters all description. Under stress, syntax compresses ("pressed the brush harder"); only minor abstraction ("strange alchemy") in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "thin line of blood" metaphor sustains without muddle. Final line ("silence forever altered") recharges "furrowed hush" with precision. One borderline abstraction ("strange alchemy") in peak beat prevents 9.2, but propulsion remains flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Blindness transformed from limitation to asset for cold cases; "void eyes" insight grows organically from tactile method. Specific detail (ribbon catching light like blood) avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking (quarry as active participant) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
