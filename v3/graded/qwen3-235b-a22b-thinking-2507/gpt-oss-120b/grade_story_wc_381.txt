<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Summoner lacks interior contradiction; motivation is archetypal but not humanized through flawed choices. No visible cost beyond ritual completion weakens Earned Stasis. "Smoothed hush" remains external technique, not embodied struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: ritual succeeds without sacrifice. Orientation anchors by line 15 pass test, but Accumulative lens falters as pressure never tightens—no complication alters tactics. Cost proof test fails at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting: its reflective surface enables cosmic lattice imagery and charges final closure ("river of stars"). Sensory specificity (pine, water's hum) filters through ritual urgency, constraining the summoner's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent celestial rupture) remains abstract—no on-page complication tests commitment. Ritual proceeds without resistance; "cost" is merely fatigue, not a trade-off. Pressure never escalates under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "smoothed hush" evolution from technique to embodied state, but final paragraph's "sang of peace" triggers Thematic Echo penalty. Avoids moralizing yet lacks conceptual repricing; cosmic/terrestrial synthesis feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ritual-focused sensory hierarchy (ignoring pain for cosmic resonance). Rhythmic control sustains trance-like state, though "tranquil blaze" repetition risks monotony. Voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("smoothed hush" variants) and "tranquil blaze" repetitions dull precision in high-pressure beats. Otherwise stellar propulsion: "paper feathers fluttering without wind" exemplifies textural density. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami cosmology and ritual ecology, but summoner archetype lacks specificity. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure succeeds, yet prophecy framework remains derivative. Emotional truth diluted by archetypal purity.</comment>
