<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied ("gnaws at the conscience I try desperately to quiet"), micro-choices like aligning driftwood fragments reveal value hierarchy, but "tempered regret" edges toward abstract label-speak in peak beats, slightly undercutting emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with legible cost ("weight of that withheld truth had finally been lifted"), but the "promise to pay enough gold" motivation remains underdeveloped, failing to constrain tactics despite early signaling, weakening causal escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The watch hand functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (ticking "metronome of redemption"), constraining choices during the driftwood search; however, "cobalt terrace" descriptions remain postcard-like without altering tactics, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate through tool integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting manufactured lies) tightens through the driftwood alignment, with visible cost in "memories... turning against me," but the gold motivation lacks integration—it doesn't alter search tactics or deepen the moral calculus, limiting escalation impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: the driftwood phrase reweights "truth's weight" without moralizing, and the final watch image offers resonant closure; near-miss for 9.0 due to "tempered regret" bordering on abstraction in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("sieved hush," carvings "pulsing faintly"), with rhythmic control under pressure, but "tempered regret" creates minor register drift from the narrator's plausible lexicon into academic abstraction during the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion overall, but "sieved hush" repetition risks synonym churn (three near-identical uses), and "metronome of redemption" slightly muddles metaphor—mechanical precision clashes with organic redemption—though neither artifact dulls the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogy-as-crime with tactile truth mechanics (driftwood carvings as ledger), transforming "weight of truth" through specific, irreplaceable details; risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry, fulfilling all 9+ criteria with emotional specificity.</comment>
