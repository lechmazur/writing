<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "rhythm of belonging" remains abstract without dramatized struggle or cost. No visible trade-offs in choices despite high-stakes setting, reducing motivation to thematic label rather than lived conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt triggers -0.4 penalty (facility revealed at 152 words), but Earned Stasis closure lands with conceptual cost: "ash can illuminate new horizons" reconfigures loss as illumination under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 due to Q2 orientation penalty; bioluminescent algae and fireflies create vivid atmosphere but function as decorative backdrops rather than constraints on action (e.g., coral pedestal alters no tactics).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes ("rhythm of belonging") lack tangible opposition; escalation is atmospheric intensification (fireflies multiplying) not agency-driven. Conceptual cost lands in final image but misses visceral trade-offs required for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ash" motif's transformation (comet memory → horizon illumination), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights loss as belonging but lacks meaningful ambiguity or counter-readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Capped due to Q7 line-level debt; voice has strong perceptual signature ("breath held in amber") but filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she understood") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Template cadence cripples propulsion: 10 consecutive "She [verb]" openings in first 200 words. Mixed metaphor ("ash-black tip still humming") creates figurative muddle in pivotal feather placement beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes astrologer + underwater lab with distinctive lyric voice, but "burnt feather as comet memory" relies on familiar magical realism tropes without transformative specificity.</comment>
