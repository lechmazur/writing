<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("compress eternity") is clear but told, not tested by conflicted choices; no contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. Micro-choices lack hierarchy (e.g., pressing bottle feels inevitable, not earned).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) reconfigures the library into portals, but conceptual cost ("fragile illusion" shattered) lacks felt weight—Mara's smile undercuts loss. Accumulative lens holds, yet cost isn't undeniable on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (frost, glass shards) but setting rarely constrains tactics; the frost "map" guides action abstractly without physical stakes. Final lattice image charges closure, yet environment doesn't shape mid-scene choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (system destabilization) signaled early, but escalation lacks Mara's agency—she reacts passively to the whisper's "rustling." Cost is conceptual yet framed positively ("true wonder"), diluting felt trade-offs under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through frost/crack imagery, but near-final line ("rustling awakenings can rewrite...") edges toward thematic echo. Conceptual Repricing works, though "captured the impossible" slightly overstates the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline geometry," "ink-stained fingertips") with rhythmic control under pressure. Fragile voice consistency in rupture scene ("shivered," "sigh of a universe rewritten") avoids overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor figurative muddle in peak beats ("shards scattering like rain" redundant with "shards fell"), but zero loops/scaffold. Final line ("clouds whispered back") resonant yet borders on cliché, avoiding closure harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress operator + frost as temporal code transforms "fragile systems" trope. Emotional specificity in Mara's quiet triumph avoids genericity, though motivation lacks depth for true risk distinction.</comment>
