<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's trembling voice while reading the riddle, embodying her truth compulsion versus longing for restored wonder. But the "involuntarily truthful" trait lacks sufficient micro-choices showing tactical cost during the box-opening climax, weakening the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the drone's "Echo" revelation reweights the tower's purpose from utility to wonder-carrier with felt cost in Mara's confession of hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric pressure buildup to the glyph revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lightning tower functions as essential micro-setting: glass rods channeling "amber veins" directly enable the climax's light cascade, while the lacquer box's oily sheen constrains Mara's tactile choices. Environment charges the final "honeyed light" image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through atmospheric deepening as the drone's hum shifts from symbol of loss to wonder-bearer, but Mara's agency in triggering the resolution feels passive—the box opens upon reading, not her choice. Visible cost in her confession lacks sufficient tactical alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "echo" reconfiguration: the drone's glyphs transform blackout silence into communal resonance without moralizing. Final image of citizens "tasting nectar dusk" offers non-literal answer to "what awakens to taste silence?" with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "voice as clear as silver bells she tended" filters all description through Mara's sensory bias. Rhythmic control peaks in the glyph revelation beat with purposeful compression ("The glyphs rearranged themselves, spelling the answer: 'Echo.'").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in closure beats, but "nectar dusk" slightly risks purple prose in high-pressure moment. Final line's "wonder would never again be dimmed by routine" leans toward thematic echo despite otherwise crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in merging drone mechanics with lyrical wonder—beehive failure transformed into "pause" awaiting echo—avoids tech-fantasy tropes. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off through atmospheric coherence, though the truth-compulsion device feels underexploited.</comment>
