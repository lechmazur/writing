<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied grief ("pull cord handle trembled as if remembering every startled gasp"), but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; "mournfully eager" trait remains label-bound without visible tradeoffs during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when conductor lowers baton with "eyes wet with gratitude," crystallizing the cost: his permanent role as mediator between sorrow and joy, charged by "the house would now hear laughter again whenever the wind dared to sing."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leaf blower functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (e.g., "blade of sound sliced through darkness like a surgeon's blade" directly enabling the ash-reassembly of jokes), charging the final image where it "fell silent, its blade of sound finally at rest."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract until late ("kitchen bowl clanged with sound of plates being set down in laughter" summarized not dramatized); pressure tightens via Accumulative lens but visible cost lacks visceral immediacy despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "broken compass" metaphor evolving from disorientation to restoration; avoids moralizing but "true haunting" tone (9J) lacks modulation under pressure, limiting resonance at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind that roared through the tunnel's arches" filtered through conductor's grief) and rhythmic control elevate tension; non-standard punctuation (em-dashes) taught early and paid off in lullaby fragments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "maculate" (Q9E) should be "macerate"—semantic error in pivotal verb triggers -0.5 penalty; otherwise, high density ("gusts to macerate stagnant air and reshape it into trembling chorus") fuels propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-melody avoids tropes; emotional specificity ("faint giggle slipped from [photograph] lips") transforms familiar premise, but safety-hedging in "sorrow and mirth can coexist" slightly dilutes boldness.</comment>
