<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>No internal conflict or contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but lacks layered struggle under pressure. Strength: embodied emotion ("copper veins tingled"). Weakness: no micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values beyond surface determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: language locked in canyon with conceptual cost ("locked forever in echo tunnel"). Accumulative lens holds consistently. Weakness: escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening—birds' response feels coincidental, not earned pressure shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice (resonant walls require rhythm) and charges final image (canyon sealing language). Bone towers' "whispering song" reweights closure. Minor flaw: "perpetual dusk" slightly generic but redeemed by tactile specifics like "wind-carved bone."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save language) tightens via diamond's cracking, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the birds' altered flight is passive observation, not active choice. Cost ("locked forever") is conceptual but not viscerally felt on the storyteller beyond abstract "weight of legacy."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: translating texture into resonance becomes "ripple across time." Final image reweights language death as potential ("might be heard by those who listen to stones") without moralizing. Near-slip: "rekindling dead words" borders thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: POV filters world through texture/sound ("wings flashing like punctuation"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("muted chimes rose") with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; lyric density taught early and paid off in closure's "whispered song."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with minimal loops, but minor overwriting in "flawed diamond rumored to be cursed" (redundant "rumored"/"legends"). Final beat strong ("shadows whispered the same song"), though "audible sculpture" slightly strains metaphor. No closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translating texture via bird patterns avoids trope clichés. Emotional truth in "weight of legacy settle like dust." Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though "cursed stone" convention is transformed through tactile specificity (spider-web fissures).</comment>
