<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; Mara’s change of monks feels unearned without visible struggle or cost to her scheme. Kovan’s transformation lacks embodied resistance—clenched jaw “unfurling” without micro-choices reflecting internal conflict. Strong cellular memory concept but edges toward therapy-speak (“rewire emotional pathways”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity undermines closure: Accumulative/Textural buildup (“shifting grace” density) conflicts with Situational pressure of the ritual. Cost is felt (“weight of anger dissolve”) but lens inconsistency past midpoint weakens causality. Strong Charged Poise ending, yet ambiguity triggers -0.4 deduction per guardrails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Obsidian sanctuary actively constrains choice—sound absorption enables whispered manipulation and charges the final image (“stone walls recognized traveler’s pulse”). Sensory details (cool lid, vibrating pin) are filtered through Mara’s pacifist bias, with micro-setting (music box) directly shaping the closure’s cellular memory payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (releasing resentment) lack protagonist agency—Mara “waits” passively while the box’s magic resolves conflict. No visible price paid; monks’ change feels effortless without trade-offs. Pressure grows texturally but fails band guardrail for 8.8+: no tangible cost altering tactics despite strong conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cellular memory reweighted at closure when wanderer recalls his mother’s lullaby, avoiding moralizing. Final image (“cradled peace instead of a sword”) offers resonant answer to resentment without stated moral. No thematic echo—Mara’s “rewire” line stays diegetic, not authorial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“muted mural of shifting grace”) but voice lacks stress modulation—lyrical cadence remains uniform during high-pressure moments (Kovan’s transformation). No head-hopping, yet psychic distance is too stable; Mara’s internal texture doesn’t compress under tension like a scheming pacifist’s should.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor synonym loops (“shifting grace” repeated without pattern payoff) and slight overwriting (“living tapestry of soft, invisible currents”) but no closure artifacts. Propulsion excels (“Mara slipped the box... waiting”) with strong textural specificity. Density remains high without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms pacifism trope through cellular memory’s fresh mechanics, but music box healing resentment echoes familiar magical realism. Specificity saves it: obsidian sanctuary’s active silence and pin’s vibration feel lived-in. Risks bold structure (Accumulative/Textural lens) yet falls short of 9+ due to derivative premise guardrail.</comment>
