<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation for discovering "texture of connection" is embodied through weaving actions, but interior contradiction is minimal; calmness lacks struggle despite high stakes. Flaws don't compound choices, weakening causal urgency at pivotal dissolution moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost: gallery dissolving into golden-rain bridge forecloses illusion with visible emotional price ("unsettling calm settle like dust"). Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks one meaningful tightening beyond steady intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Optical illusion gallery functions as micro-setting where "liquid glass" walls actively respond to weaving, charging the final bridge image. However, environment rarely constrains choices—it reacts rather than pressures tactics during key turns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through weaving-driven eruptions that narrow options toward reality's dissolution, with cost legible in the architect's irreversible shift from illusion. Agency feels passive during golden-rain eruption; pressure accumulates without active protagonist adaptation at climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through golden-rain bridge as "realistically imaginary proof," avoiding moralizing. Final line ("endless eruption of quiet wonder") resonates non-literally, but "rational enchantment" label risks thematic echo near closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "walls bent perspective like liquid glass," with rhythm mirroring weaving cadence. Minor register drift in "conjectured" and repetitive "unsettling calm" dilute pressure during high-stakes dissolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density, but "soft, golden rain" → "delicate strands that stitched ground to sky" borders purple prose in climax. Overwritten modifiers slightly dull closure's immediacy despite strong propulsion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "rational enchantment" elevates trope, with sinew thread as organic conduit for emotional texture. Gallery setting leans derivative, but risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence without obscuring closure.</comment>
