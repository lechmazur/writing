<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority relies on labels ("realized," "knew") without contradictory impulses during pivotal discovery; release decision lacks visible internal cost beyond action. Strength: embodied professionalism in probe navigation under inversion pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure (Earned Stasis via tip dissolution) lands with conceptual cost (irreversible sacrifice for cyclical renewal), but lens wavers between Accumulative (atmosphere) and Causal until climax. Anchors clear by 100 words; soft reset glosses prior tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (arrow tip) charges closure through dissolution into renewal particles, while gravity inversion constrains tactics (timed release with descending flow). Cap at 8.8 per 9+ gate: environment shapes final image but lacks occupational depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via discovery-to-release escalation under Causal lens, but agency feels passive—the tip "emitted a hum," trees "responded instantly." Cost (dissolution) is visible yet lacks tradeoff; luck nearly resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "listening to echoes" as cultural memory vs. physical artifact, reweighted by final image (humming orchard). Avoids moralizing, but early "source of resilience" risks thematic echo; cost stays conceptual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("whirling silence," "fruit floated like quiet balloons") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor deduction: "realized/knew" flatten interiority; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density multiplies jobs per line ("river ran upward, its current defying expectation"). Final image avoids abstraction through sensory "humming," though "murmurs of past pilots" edges cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ecological fantasy via gravity-inversion cycles and star-metal as growth catalyst. Risk-taking in quiet closure (dissolution over triumph) heightens stakes; specificity (echo resonance, moss-veiled tip) avoids trope reliance.</comment>
