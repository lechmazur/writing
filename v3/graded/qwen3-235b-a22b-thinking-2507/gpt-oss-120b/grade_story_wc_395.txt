<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action ("traced metadata," "fabricated a lie") with embodied motivation shift from curiosity to lifeline. Contradictory impulse (truth-seeking via deception) lacks deeper flaw integration; micro-choices reveal values but internal conflict remains surface-level under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation clear by line 3 (vaulted archives, hum of data). Causal lens holds: metadata → fabricated post → algorithm response → terminal discovery. Closure as Charged Poise ("absence transformed into quiet presence") with visible cost in Lia's vow to guard archives, crystallized by the crew's final message.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Archive setting actively constrains choices: obsolete emojis hide server, terminal file paths vanish when copied, static air forces tactile navigation. Final image of the patch "connecting humanity’s past" charges closure through environmental specificity, not generic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding crew's truth) tightens via Lia's lie triggering algorithm redistribution. Pressure grows through protagonist agency: fabricated post → phantom breadcrumbs → checksum realization. Cost is visceral—"building itself mourned what it had lost"—reconfiguring Lia's purpose into responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: numbers as lifelines, archive as digital afterlife. Final line "We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence" delivers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing, reweighting "sensed absence" into tangible connection through the patch’s resurrection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices "amber light," "rustled rack," "faded chorus." Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during terminal discovery). Slight register drift in "hypothesized" early on, but voice remains cohesive through lyrical compression in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("glowed like phantom breadcrumbs," "resurrected log singing echoes"). Final line crystallizes theme without telling. Figurative language serves pressure: "hum of forgotten data like distant choir" establishes tone without muddling causality in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "lost expedition" trope via social media archaeology: metadata as survival tool, deleted files as digital afterlife. Risk-taking (archive as character) heightens stakes through specific, verifiable detail like the 17-42-108 checksum mechanics, avoiding generic sci-fi.</comment>
