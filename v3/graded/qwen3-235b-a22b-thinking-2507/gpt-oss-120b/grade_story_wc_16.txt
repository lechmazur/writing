<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows "carefully reckless" tension through measured steps amid exuberance, but lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal glyph-unraveling; final covenant renewal feels earned though shadow scholars' appearance strains causality slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the archive's breath and keepers' nod crystallize the "renewed covenant" with conceptual cost of broken trust mended; accumulative/textural lens holds through glyph progression tightening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass ink well functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (whispering promises to glyphs) and charging the final image as "beacon"; sensory details like "luminescent script fell like droplets" embody the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through glyph progression from curve to storm-knot, with "time pressed" tightening options; cost is felt in the weight of "renewed covenant," though vague urgency lacks concrete clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "symphonies of truth" reweights silence as covenant breach without moralizing; final image of archive breathing offers resonant answer to "restore trust" through tangible renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cautious exuberance," "fragile bridges") modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "pulsem with quiet, urgent melody" slightly jars linguist's plausible diction during high-stakes transcription.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density falters with paraphrase loop: "cautious exuberance" repeats verbatim; "carefully reckless" label lacks embodied contradiction, diluting propulsion in climax beat despite otherwise vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic restoration as covenant renewal avoids fantasy tropes; risk-taking in "interconnected promises" method heightens stakes, though "glass ink well" edges toward familiar magical object without full transformation.</comment>
