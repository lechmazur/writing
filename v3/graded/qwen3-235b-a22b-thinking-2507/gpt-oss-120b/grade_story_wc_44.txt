<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for "where shadows go" is childhood-rooted and consistent, but lacks contradictory impulses; "quietly deliberate" trait shows in tracing actions yet interiority remains observational without internal conflict under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—key winding down and island settling shows expended energy cost—but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful deepening; single tightening (rune completion) insufficiently narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clockwork key functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (glyph alignment) and charges final image (winding down); observatory's copper plates and scent of parchment actively shape tactics during rune tracing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding shadow paths) tightens when key activates doorway, but pressure lacks teeth—no tangible opposition or cost escalation; agency is present but conflict remains abstract without visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of closure/loops emerges through action (relearning glyphs), not statement; final image of shadows migrating to luminous chamber reweights the quest without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber glyphs," "scent of old parchment") persists under pressure; rhythmic control varies with scene intensity (e.g., "soft chime" vs. "thrummed with heartbeat"), no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loops ("quietly deliberate" repetition); "thrummed with the heartbeat" borders cliché but final beat remains clear—no figurative muddle in closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow mythology via "sealed awakenings" and spoon-bending backstory; specific details (copper plates, gear-etched runes) transform tropes without gimmickry.</comment>
