<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority rich but lacks contradictory impulses; "meticulous" trait drives action without meaningful internal conflict. Motivation clear but endurance lacks visible cost escalation beyond quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with tube rising on the gust, but quarantine pressure remains situational rather than escalating causally. Cost felt but not concretely demonstrated on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as micro-setting: the shaft beneath the fountain directly enables the solution, charging the final image. Moss/stone constrain choice and embody the "layered tranquility" theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Quarantine stake signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation; lateral thinking resolves tension without narrowing options or raising cost. Pressure remains static despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of integrity through solitude emerges organically via action, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "truth will find a way" with tangible hope, though cost remains oblique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised violet" sky, "whispered secrets" vines) with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor filter verbs ("she could intuit") dilute immediacy in key beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion but "layered tranquility" repetition creates subtle synonym loop. "Pulse in her own chest" metaphor borders on cliché yet avoids full artifact penalty through context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lateral thinking transforms quarantine trope through occupational specificity. Risk-taking heightens stakes, but emotional complexity lacks the required "non-obvious synthesis" for 9.0.</comment>
