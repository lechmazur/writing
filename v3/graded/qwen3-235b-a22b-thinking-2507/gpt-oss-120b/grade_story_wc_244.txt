<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Lira’s "desperately jocular" facade masking earnest mission, but her flaw (treating cure as external object) lacks visceral struggle during the pivotal ivy-cutting. Micro-choice depth falters as crew assembly feels consequence-free.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the chime’s "fleeting lift" crystallizes reciprocity’s cost—connection as ongoing labor, not magic fix. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory density buildup to the final "less isolated" image with undeniable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (puzzle pattern) and charges closure—its "emerald tangle" falling like curtains mirrors the revelation of connection. Final image of "ivy-clad arches" reweights the neglect motif with earned hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (curing loneliness) deepen via the moon rock’s ripple effect, but escalation lacks tangible friction—the ivy-cutting puzzle resolves too neatly without cost. Protagonist agency drives the action, yet the "polite anarchy" concept isn’t tested under pressure until payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "cure... not a potion but the act of catalyzing connections" reframes loneliness through action. Final image rejects tidy resolution, offering "quiet laughter" as non-literal answer to isolation’s complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rustled hinge" laugh, "captive star" moon rock) persists under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks in the chime’s spread "along rumor chains," though "polite anarchy" label slightly disrupts voice cohesion in mid-scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "ivy fell back like curtains" merges action/image. Minor overwriting in "captive star" metaphor, but density soars in closure—"sun slipped behind ivy-clad arches" recharges the opening with zero scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "polite rebellion" as logistical empathy avoids cliché. Risk-taking with quiet closure pays off, though moon rock premise edges close to derivative—saved by grounding in Lira’s disaster-relief pragmatism and tactile reciprocity mechanics.</comment>
