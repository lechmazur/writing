<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "heart beat steady with purpose" avoids self-doubt despite "cry wolf" history. Final choice lacks visible cost beyond emotional resolution, weakening Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (transforming legend into guidance), but the lattice's "hum" implies future protection without tangible sacrifice. Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant) holds through final beacon image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Recurring "copperlight repose" charges closure, but reef setting fails to constrain choices—stepping on slick rocks causes no physical consequence. Lattice qualifies as micro-setting but doesn't alter tactics beyond glowing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stake (proving warnings true) tightens via map discovery, yet cost remains abstract; no visible price paid (e.g., injury, exhaustion). Agency in "threading labyrinth" drives escalation, but conceptual redemption lacks felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Every warning is a thread, not a wall" avoids moralizing, but "beacon of truth" oversimplifies thematic complexity. Bodies rising "grateful" undermines moral ambiguity, though map-as-story offers resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "hush" as character), but "lattice from confessional" repetition feels scaffolded. No head-hopping, though sea anthropomorphism ("whispering") strains POV consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Overwriting weakens peak beats: "stone walls breathing salty wind like an old sermon" muddles metaphor. "Copperlight repose" repeats 4x without pattern-teaching; final image ("beacon of truth") is clean but preceded by density issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "cry wolf" trope via magical realism, but "lattice as protection" feels derivative. Emotional specificity in chasing hush elevates, though "bodies awaiting discovery" leans on mystery tropes.</comment>
