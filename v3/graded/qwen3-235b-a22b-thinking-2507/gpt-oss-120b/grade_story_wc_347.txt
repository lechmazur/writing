<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "reluctant caretaker" role and "bitter sweetness" endurance, but mechanical birds lack reactive pressure; micro-choices like reed impressions reveal hierarchy without secondary character friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("ash on tongue," cyclical burden), but frost deadline lacks dramatized escalation; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though time pressure feels undersold before the stump.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard's curse constrains every choice; "hollow stump" and "frost" charge the final image as the nut's glow spills through roots, transforming the labyrinth from death-trap to beacon through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via frost deadline, but urgency remains declared not embodied; no visible struggle against time despite "pulse-rhythm" gears—cost is emotional (bitter ash) not tactical, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" risks thematic echo but avoids moralizing via concrete image: travelers' safety glowing "brighter than any curse" reweights redemption as cyclical wound, not victory, with conceptual cost in the orchard's sigh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "tracing patterns in wind with reed only birds see"; rhythm modulates from patient surgeon to pulse-rhythm gears, with lyric compression ("frost retreats like dying dragon") taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "fruit to ash" to "ash on tongue" reprises with cost, but "jagged elegance that feels like a wound" risks stock metaphor—elevated by context yet slightly overwrought in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed orchard" trope through mechanical birds and blueprint-in-nut; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes, but "reluctant caretaker" archetype lacks fresh inflection beyond the graceless redemption angle.</comment>
