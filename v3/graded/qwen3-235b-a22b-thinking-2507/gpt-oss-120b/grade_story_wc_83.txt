<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "dread and exhilaration" at the fissure, with grief-as-fuel embodied through "breath that tasted of rust." Lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle; grief’s persistence isn’t tested beyond the single action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as "bleak exhilaration floods his veins" amid the hovering shards—reconfiguring "unused potential" as state-of-being with visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: pressure tightens via sensory density (geode’s hum → chord) without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Geode crystal constrains choice (calibrating visor to read frequencies) and charges closure as "tangible echo" shards. Floating observatory’s "seam" directly enables the energy pool discovery—micro-setting as essential pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the fissure appears: "unused potential" shifts from external hunt to internal state. Protagonist’s agency ("thrust his palm") drives escalation under Accumulative lens; cost is palpable in "bleak sky could no longer drown his resolve."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "hunt was not for external treasure" crystallizes the shift from loss to potential. Final image ("shards like constellation of hopes") reweights "unused pools" without moralizing—complexity intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky...bruised violet," "grief was a fuel") with rhythmic control: short sentences at climax ("He thrust his palm") mirror tension. Compression taught early ("circuit breakers cooled...hissing") pays off in closure’s density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("valves hissing like dying beasts" → "thrusted his palm"). "Intangibly tangible" avoids abstraction through physicality ("air feel heavier than stone"), though one borderline label instance prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via scientific lens (perturbation theory as emotional framework). "Unused potential pools" as state-of-being feels fresh, with shards as "tangible echo" synthesizing loss/clarity—risk-taking heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
