<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pacifist vow drives climax ("no force, only compassion"), but "hidden grief that bound the veil" uses diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, triggering -0.5 penalty. Contradictory joy/sorrow embodiment remains strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: "resolve as cold as the void" and ship's emptiness after Nara's step through. Accumulative lens holds through shimmer-to-garden intensification without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recycled hull functions as micro-setting: "hull sighed" when gravity loosens, charging final image. Fades photographs constrain stitching method, but environmental specificity narrowly misses 9+ gate for final image constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via joy-induced weightlessness enabling the final stitch, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—pale wind breakthrough feels coincidental rather than earned by Nara's choices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sorrow transformed into new beginnings" without moralizing. Final garden pulse reweights grief via unnamed colors of "worlds that never came to be," avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "shimmer of long-dried tears" filters grief through light physics. Tense shifts in climax ("stepped through... continued its drift") intentionally modulate emotional distance without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Gravitationally lighter" phrasing ("impossible physics whispered through her bones") uses abstract label instead of concrete sensation in high-pressure beat, triggering -0.4 loop penalty. Otherwise strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pacifism with physics-based grief work; "mournful fireflies" metaphor transforms sorrow into action. Avoids derivative post-apocalyptic tropes through luminous garden closure.</comment>
