<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "agreed upon lies" framework and sugar oversight amid cosmic spectacle; embodied humility at closure ("feeling both humbled and newly fluent") earns endurance with visible cost. Slight abstraction in "purpose of my quest became clear" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes: weekly lessons and "building itself could speak" reconfigure options with humility as cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—meteor intensification and sugar ritual deepen density without causal breaks. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop garden’s rosemary bush, rusted rail, and borrowed sugar constrain choices (forgotten sugar forces neighbor interaction) and charge final image. Mossy bench and seal’s waxed impression mirror internal shifts without symbolism. Micro-setting as crucible elevates beyond vivid description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Accumulative lens: meteor shower’s "fleeting hymns" deepen density as narrator moves from decoding inscriptions to "hearing heartbeats of forgotten walls." Cost is humility and reframed purpose, visible in "newly fluent" realization. Single tightening sufficient for scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through seal’s sigil ("pact of agreed upon lies") reweighted as "stepping stone toward truth," avoiding moralizing. Final image—"building itself could speak without secrecy"—resonates as non-literal answer to "language of stone" quest. Complexity in lies/truth dialectic lingers without resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fingertips brushing rusted iron rail for hidden meaning" reflects narrator’s architectural obsession. Rhythmic control under meteor shower pressure ("each streak a fleeting hymn") avoids ventriloquism. Slight register drift in "murmurs embedded in brick" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with zero scaffold but "murmurs embedded in brick" risks abstraction in high-pressure beat. Final line’s "speak to us without secrecy" crystallizes propulsion. Near-miss figurative muddle in "stitch the night’s fleeting light into brick’s silent grammar" limits score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "language of buildings" trope through "agreed upon lies" framework and meteor shower urgency. Specificity (hummingbird feeder, rosemary bush) grounds universals. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though not quite inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
