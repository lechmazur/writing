<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority poetic but motivation ("capture possibility") remains abstract; transformation via "murmured allegiance" lacks embodied contradiction or earned cost despite strong physicality in armor-to-moss dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (knight dissolving into orchard with "endless tomorrows"), but escalation under Accumulative lens feels gentle—no meaningful tightening of options despite vapor-bridge creation; cost (armor melting) visible yet weightless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as active micro-setting: rusted glyphs require program knowledge, luminescent moss directly enables closure; "factually mystical" vapor constrains choices by demanding forgotten patterns, charging final image of stitched-night tapestry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("capture possibility") never concretizes into trade-offs—knight shifts allegiance without friction; "endless night" pressure accumulates texturally but lacks deepening under Accumulative lens, leaving cost (armor melting) emotionally unearned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "loyalty was not a chain but a song" crystallizes via spore-stitching and unsnapping, avoiding moralizing; final "endless tomorrows" image reweights "endless night" with conceptual cost (self-dissolution) without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath a tiny bell," "vines exhaled vapor") modulates perfectly from oppressive gloom to symphonic bliss; rhythm shifts from languid ("night stretched like canvas") to urgent ("unsnap the lock") without syntax monotony or POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "pages curled like wilted petals" does triple duty (image/theme/motif); minor overwriting in "breath rang with promise of futures" redeemed by concrete "iron and jasmine" scent; zero loops or scaffold even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: alchemical orchard reimagines theater as ritual space, "knight" as solitary steward; "capture possibility" motivation feels fresh through iron/jasmine paradox and spore-stitching, avoiding derivative fantasy via specific sensory logic.</comment>
