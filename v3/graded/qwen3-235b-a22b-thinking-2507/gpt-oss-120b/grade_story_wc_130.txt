<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conjurer's motivation ("gently inventive") lacks embodied contradiction; emotions remain abstract ("pulse of hope") without specific physicality. Micro-choices align with goals but omit genuine struggle against flaws. Interiority leans on lyrical telling ("delicate dance between curiosity and compassion") rather than character-particular sensory evidence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: unclear who/where past 120 words ("secretive conjurer" in "cavern orchard" lacks anchoring). Closure achieves Charged Poise (grief+hope=renewal) with conceptual cost, but causal pressure is thin. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cavern orchard is vivid but functions as decorative backdrop; stalactites and moss don't constrain choices or alter tactics. Micro-setting (glass eyes) charges the final image, yet environment remains postcard-like. Sensory details prioritize lyricism over urgency-driven selection (e.g., "silver notes" during high-stakes ritual).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation: "ambiguous loss" is thematic but never tests the conjurer through concrete stakes. The drip-on-stone "chime" is coincidence, not agency-driven pressure. Dominant stake (understanding emotion's math) lacks opposition or trade-offs; no narrowing of options occurs before closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glass eyes' transformation ("subtraction that made room for new addition"). Final image ("garden of possibilities") reweights grief as growth without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insights in concrete ritual ("vibrations translated loss into numbers").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fruits that glimmered like pale lanterns") and rhythmic control elevate tension. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: short clauses during ritual ("He placed... aligning each iris"), lyrical flow in reflection. Zero head-hopping; consistent focalization through conjurer's sensory lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in high-pressure beat: "His purpose was gently inventive, a delicate dance..." tells rather than shows motivation. Otherwise, exceptional density ("polished ivory gleaming as if they held a secret heartbeat"). Rhythm varies naturally; no figurative muddle despite lush imagery. Final line achieves resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of taxidermist eyes as emotional calculators transforms magical realism tropes. "Mathematics of emotion" premise avoids abstraction through concrete ritual (stone cracks → numbers). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure works, but "secretive conjurer" archetype lacks specificity to feel fully inevitable.</comment>
