<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through concrete embodiment ("numbness cracking like ice"); contradictory impulses act simultaneously as Kael merges "compassion and resolve" before slicing. Final choice earns change via prior causality, but Syndicate/Guardians lack sufficient pressure to compound stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "numbness cracking" and shattered glass reconfigure coexistence stakes. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density ("air sang," "luminous fluid") tightening emotional stakes. Only minor flaw: Mara's introduction slightly dilutes final image focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating dojo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (glass cylinder placement) and charges closure ("stones hummed, resonating with twin beats"). "Blade of paradox" as recurring object reweights meaning, though "sea of shifting chronologies" lacks tactile specificity to reach 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens through Kael's internal deepening ("pair each breath of calm with a strike of purpose"). Cost is visceral in "numbness cracking," but Syndicate/Guardians apply generic pressure without adapting tactics, limiting escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "complementary opposites" motif, culminating in non-literal closure ("shared heartbeat that promised a future"). Avoids moralizing, though Mara's "fragile self" dialogue risks thematic echo near endpoint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("veins pulsing with faint bioluminescence") and rhythmic control under pressure ("The jar cracked..."). Free indirect style clean; lexicon stays within Kael's conceptual framework ("paradoxical truth," "vivifying"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "slicing through pretense" phrase recurs with purposeful variation. Minor synonym churn ("luminous fluid" → "luminous fluid") in awakening beat costs 0.2, but peak beats maintain crystalline clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms clone trope via emotional coexistence premise. "Blade of paradox" as conceptual object feels inevitable, with risk-taking (abstract concepts as physical stakes) heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
