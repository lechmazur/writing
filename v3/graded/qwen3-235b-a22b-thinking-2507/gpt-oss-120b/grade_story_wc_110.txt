<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in forgotten case feels earned, but interior contradiction lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; Mara's flaw of passive observation isn't tested under pressure during key lens placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (mistrust thawing), but causal linkage to doodles-to-mic sequence is vague; "residual light" physics amnesia slightly undermines Accumulative lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: puddles constrain choices (reflected confessions) and charge final image; rain's cessation directly enables the "chorus of murmurs," meeting 9+ gate through environmental pressure on truth-telling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thawing mistrust) tightens through lens projection deepening the town's collective honesty, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; Mara observes rather than actively overcomes opposition under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (puddle reflections, ink shimmer), but "honesty had freed them without a single accusation" risks thematic echo; avoids moralizing yet conceptual cost lacks visceral weight at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ledger closed/thoughts folded like origami") and rhythmic control shine, though "trembling honesty of the walls" edges toward abstract personification during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose flows with high density, but adjacent synonym loops ("ambiguously clear" ×5) and stock metaphors ("sigh of a city") trigger −0.4 penalty; final image remains clear despite minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of projector lens as truth-amplifier transforms trope, yet "freed by honesty" core concept lacks non-obvious moral calculus; specificity anchors universals but safety-hedging in resolution limits risk.</comment>
