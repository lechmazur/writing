<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through claustrophobia vs. mission drive, but Mara's pivotal transition lacks embodied struggle—tide apex pressure triggers phase shift without visible panic micro-choices that would cement her flaw-complication arc under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: burying the codex with "claustrophobic heart finally at ease" crystallizes cost through transformed relationship to tight spaces, though "quiet triumph" slightly tells rather than shows the earned peace.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The codex’s gold flecks charge the final image—constraining Mara’s choices throughout while evolving from fragile artifact to "promise that invisible threads would never be forgotten," perfectly embodying the micro-setting rule for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten credibly as tide rises toward apex, but the phase transition’s danger ("strand her in a void") lacks felt cost escalation—Mara’s fear of tight spaces isn’t tested *during* the shift, missing a chance to deepen the dominant stake through agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "standing by the unremembered," culminating in the codex burial as resonant answer—no moralizing, though "invisible threads of the world" risks slight abstraction where concrete sensory payoff (salt-crusted hands?) would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath shallow as tide rose," "pressure tasted of brine") sustains under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from crashing hush to breathless instant without head-hopping—lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Overwriting in "hulking mouth that swallowed any hint of daylight" creates mixed metaphor (mouth/light), and "crashing hush" repetition dulls momentum; otherwise pristine propulsion with zero scaffold in closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking claustrophobia with undersea phase transitions avoids genre tropes—specificity of "phosphorescent ink cables" and tidal mechanics transforms familiar themes, though codex margin detail feels slightly convenient for the climax.</comment>
