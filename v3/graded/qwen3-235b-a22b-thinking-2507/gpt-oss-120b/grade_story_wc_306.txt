<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("sincerely insincere") is embodied in micro-choices like the "genuinely insincere grin," but the magistrate remains a symbolic cipher; Mara's flaws lack concrete stakes beyond thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (magistrate's softened resolve), but causal links between wind chime patterns and decree-unraveling feel undermotivated; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds yet pressure lacks visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting actively constrains choice: wind chimes dictate Mara's method, the lantern's glass enables the mirror's reflection, and the hollow shard becomes the final image charging closure; sensory details serve pressure not ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes (nuance vs. certainty) deepen through Mara's actions, but pressure lacks tangible cost escalation; magistrate's internal shift feels earned yet abstract, missing a visceral price like revoked authority or public consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (unhooking the knot, mirror shard's emptiness) rather than moralizing; final image reweights "truth" as multifaceted without stating a thesis, though nuance occasionally borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind whispered against stone," "tide's pulse") weaves voice with pressure; rhythmic control tightens during the mirror placement beat, though "sincerely insincere" phrasing risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with strategic figurative language ("cloak of doubt," "prism of possibility"), but minor scaffold in "Mara, who was sincerely insincere..." dilutes immediacy; no closure-impairing artifacts yet slight overwriting in dawn descriptions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "conscience for hire" with lighthouse symbolism avoids tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative lens pays off via wind chime mechanics, though emotional specificity lacks raw edges of genuine vulnerability.</comment>
