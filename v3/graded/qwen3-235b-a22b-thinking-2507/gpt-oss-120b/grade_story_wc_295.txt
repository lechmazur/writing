<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; emotional progression feels tidied rather than layered. Final choice to share burdens is earned but "weight lift" stated not embodied (e.g., "fracture within her own doubts" repaired without visceral cost). No secondary character to create relationship dynamics or status shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: temple opening crystallizes "contract between seekers and sky" with felt cost in repaired self-doubt. Accumulative lens holds through star-glyph pattern deepening. Minor cost abstraction ("burden lift, not removed but shared" lacks physical manifestation) prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting that charges closure: telescope alignment and crystal reflection directly constrain decoding tactics. "Ozone scent blending with daylily perfume" at revelation moment proves environment shapes the final image. Meets 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding alone vs. sharing burdens) tightens through Accumulative deepening as symbols accumulate pressure. Agency clear in whispering to sky and telescope alignment, but cost remains conceptual ("fracture within doubts") without tangible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: telegram as key, crystal reflection, and "lullaby of midnight solace" reconfigure "shared burdens" without moralizing. Final image of "living bridge between sky and stone" offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo in closing paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "glyphs lingered... echoing variable stars" and scent-driven memory. Rhythmic control falters slightly in climax ("She lifted the telescope...") with repetitive syntax. No head-hopping; POV stability supports Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "midnight solace" appears three times with near-identical phrasing (paragraphs 3,5,6), dulling closure impact. Strong verbs ("humming with residue", "flickered acknowledging") offset occasional elevated diction ("lucid dream chronicler"). Final line avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astronomy and dream-chronicling via specific details (daylily-pressed telegram, heart-rhythm star alignment). Emotional truth in "burden lift, not removed but shared" avoids generic healing tropes. Transformation test passed: removing observatory breaks decoding logic.</comment>
