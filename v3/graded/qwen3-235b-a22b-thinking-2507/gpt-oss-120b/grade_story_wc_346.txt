<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (trembling hands/mending cracks) but diagnostic "bruised awe" label in peak beat undermines embodied emotion; micro-choices like dial-turning reveal values without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes time’s fragility through lullaby’s woven resonance, but conceptual cost remains abstract—no on-page price for borrowed pause despite "weight of lifetimes" hint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse stones and broken puppet head constrain choices (dial placement) and charge the final image; "glass eye glittering like a promise" transforms into vessel for lifetimes, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through pane-of-hush activation narrowing Elara’s options to whispering, but cost remains conceptual—no tangible forfeiture (e.g., vitality loss) to ground the "borrowed pause" trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "beauty in being beautifully flawed" crystallizes via puppet/lighthouse parallels, but final "promise echoing forever" edges toward moralizing, weakening earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breath a thin thread of frost," "fossilized rhythm") modulates with pressure, yet repetitive "bruised awe" dilutes emotional specificity in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Zero loops but "bruised awe" paraphrase cluster (3x in 150 words) and "like a promise" simile in peak action violate density rules; "glowing with quiet fire" rescues closure image from overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-as-texture (nested echoes) avoids doomsday clichés; risk-taking in lyric escalation pays off through lullaby’s woven resonance, though "pane of hush" concept borders on familiar.</comment>
