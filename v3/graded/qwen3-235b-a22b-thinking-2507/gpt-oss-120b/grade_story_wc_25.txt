<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; interiority remains stubbornly steadfast without visible internal conflict during pivotal moments like the whisper test. Final validation feels unearned as no prior struggle shows competing desires beyond his single-minded belief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (key vibration, "labyrinth breathe with his rhythm") with conceptual cost, but map's self-reconfiguring path strains causality under Accumulative lens. Storm-driven escalation tightens meaningfully though the tunnel's sudden appearance relies on coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers actively constrain choices—map guides through aisles, radios require storm frequency, key opens hidden seams. Final image of containers as "silent sentinels" charges closure by embodying the whisper theme through physical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Milo's agency: whisper triggers map glow, key vibration guides tunnel discovery. Cost is conceptual (proof of whispers' power) but feels abstract; physical toll or emotional vulnerability would deepen stakes beyond intellectual validation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "tides will turn" evolving from literal phrase to metaphor for hidden communication. Final parchment avoids moralizing by being diegetic, with "whispers are true currents" reweighting prior material through charged image, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("creases like age-worn veins," "electric tang on skin") modulates under pressure—syntax tightens during storm surge. No POV leaks; "calculated spontaneity" laugh shows voice-specific emotional contradiction without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and specificity ("hiss of geomagnetic storm," "moth’s wing" voice) marred by minor artifacts: "calculated spontaneity" is clinical phrasing, and final "labyrinth breathe with his rhythm" borders on purple prose despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms shipping containers via geomagnetic lens—whispers riding electromagnetic waves feels fresh. Avoids cliché by making zodiac coin practical (radio amplifier), though key's "smooth useless teeth" risks symbolic convenience without sufficient prior grounding.</comment>
