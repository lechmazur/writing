<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; motivation is clear but internal conflict remains abstract ("stitching hope" without tangible struggle). Micro-choices absent—sewing is ritualistic, not pressured by stakes. "Hauntingly optimistic" trait stated but not tested through embodied tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: the woven labyrinth guides travelers with conceptual cost (empty tide pools, broken precedents). Accumulative lens holds—density of luminous threads reweights "ruin to reverence" with felt cost in the final image ("echo of her song lingered"). No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Red canyon walls and storybook plate constrain choice: the plate evolves from "painted scenes" to "living map," charging the closure. Sensory details ("orchid solace," "cracked tide pools") filter through weaver’s purpose, avoiding white-room syndrome. Micro-setting (loom, yarn) charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carving reverence from ruin) tightens via the plate’s evolution and guilds’ crumbling, but pressure lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or protagonist-driven deepening. Cost (empty tide pools, broken precedents) is felt but not actively paid; reliance on atmospheric accumulation weakens causal agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "ruin to reverence" reconfiguration in the final image, avoiding moralizing. However, "every ruin could become reverence" borders on thematic echo, nearly triggering Q5 penalty. Orchid/tide motifs charge closure without abstraction, but secondary stake ("broken precedents") lacks depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("orchid solace," "luminous veins like orchid veins in frost") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control in high-stakes beats ("her feet brushed cool stone while her mind painted new corridors") avoids scaffold. No head-hopping; lyrical elision taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("each brushstroke seemed to sing a hauntingly optimistic lullaby" compresses action/theme). But "orchid" repetition verges on ornamental—three adjacent "orchid" references in final paragraph dull closure propulsion. No figurative muddle; cadence shifts with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "wharf weaver" in a canyon labyrinth transforms tropes via specific stakes (empty tide pools as silence that "sings"). Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens coherence—closure’s conceptual cost feels inevitable. Avoids derivative safety; emotional truth in "hauntingly optimistic" endurance.</comment>
