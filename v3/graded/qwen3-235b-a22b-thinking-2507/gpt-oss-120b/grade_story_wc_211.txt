<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction weak—Harel’s archiving duty faces no tangible conflict despite prophecy stakes; third-grade memory functions as deus ex machina without prior anchoring. Final choice lacks earned cost beyond metaphorical "dew."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: prophecy reconfigured into cyclical promise with felt cost ("weight settle like dew"). Orientation solid early; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening to final ink-sealed vellum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard’s pomegranates tremble from prophecy vibrations, phonograph wax directly enables climax. Micro-setting (wax cylinder) constrains choice (shaving releases sighs) and charges closure image—environment essential per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract: "archiving emotional patterns" vs prophecy lacks concrete test. Third-grade memory "bridge" feels inserted, not earned escalation. Cost is conceptual (dew-weight) without tactical forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wax cylinders as "living archive," children’s soil-questions reweighted in final line. Avoids moralizing; "teaching the living to listen" resonates non-literally without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature (Akkadian vibrations, wind-pause at Persian line) sustains Accumulative lens. Minor POV breach: "city below breathed easier" exceeds Harel’s limited knowledge, capping near-9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "needle scraped a cracked groove, a thin thread of sound unfurled" avoids loops. Minor "rust" repetition (steel/wax) serves texture, not scaffold. Final line’s lyricism charges closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "accidental prophecy" as emotional map subverts trope; sky orchard’s plum that "sings" grounds abstraction. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes coherently—closure image inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
