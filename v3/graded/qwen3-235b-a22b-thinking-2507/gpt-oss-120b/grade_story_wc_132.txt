<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlowe's interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "circuitously sincere" is stated not tested through meaningful choices. Closure choice (stepping back) feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly with sensory accumulation toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is palpable in "reluctant metamorphosis" as the leaf's slow surrender charges the verdant green payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but mossy trellis/rain function as backdrop, not constraint. Final image lacks environmental pressure per 9+ gate—copper coil matters less than the leaf's inherent biology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (observing transformation) is clear but unchallenged; no active opposition. Escalation via accumulation works for lens, but "reluctant" leaf isn't resisting Marlowe, limiting tension depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through action: "releasing control" shown via copper coil/mycelium, not stated. Final image of "circuitous loops" reweights the premise without moralizing, hitting the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose has distinct rhythm but "circuitously sincere" becomes a tic; high-pressure beats risk overwriting ("refracted light like tiny prisms"). Final paragraph's lyrical density slightly obscures momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Most lines achieve high density, but final paragraph's template cadence ("He felt... He built... He introduced...") triggers loop penalty, dulling closure propulsion per Q7 artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elevated by specific horticultural details, but emotional arc feels derivative of quiet epiphany tropes. No bold risks—avoids safety middle yet lacks transformative synthesis for higher bands.</comment>
