<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Diagnostic label-speak ("phosphorescence like a disease") triggers penalty; interior contradiction under pressure absent despite high stakes. Micro-choice (swallowing clasp) lacks layered values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost proof; "carry luminance forever" stated but not embodied. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost remains conceptual, not felt on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Funhouse functions as micro-setting: carousel horse dissolution directly charges climax. "Copper and rot" air taste constrains Mara’s breath, making environment essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Mara’s "vanish" whisper feels unearned. Visible price ("carry luminance") charges final image yet emerges too late.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through cursed rose reprise (clasp→ink smears), avoiding moralizing. Final bargain’s "beacon for dread" reweights fear without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sour scent like syrup," "photon haze") sustains under pressure. Rhythmic control in climax ("shards exploded into lingering luminance") avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphor clash in climax ("shudder rippled... unspooling shadows like ribbons") obscures causality. Final third artifacts ("repulsive allure" repetition) block 9+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Photographically cursed" transforms fear trope through specific object logic. Derivative carnival framework elevated by cursed rose’s causal role in dissolution.</comment>
