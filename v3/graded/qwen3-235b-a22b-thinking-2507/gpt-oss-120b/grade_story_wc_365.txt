<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via sensory mapping ("cartographic ribbons that only I can read"), but emotional contradiction lacks depth during climax—discovery to "sudden compulsion" feels abrupt without layered struggle. Motivation ("weight of withheld truth") is embodied yet the final renunciation lacks micro-choice stakes scaling to closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost: shard fracture ("countless specks that drifted like stars") directly enables crew awakening. Causal lens holds tightly (shard redirect → slit → discovery → resolution), though merging realities via redirection lacks full foreshadowing in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Green shard functions as micro-setting: constrains choices (must align maps to "prismatic aura") and charges final image ("scattered among the stars"). Repair bay details ("rusted hulls sighing in relief") evolve causally with plot, avoiding static description through Lira’s sensory POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Lira’s agency: redirecting flow to access hidden log forces moral trade-off (truth’s "weight" vs. crew’s freedom). Cost is unmistakable—the shard’s destruction—yet escalation’s sole tightening feels slightly underdeveloped in the log-revelation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lightness of shared knowledge" reweighting the shard’s fracture, avoiding moralizing. Final whisper ("weaving between worlds was not a task but a promise") slightly softens conceptual cost, edging toward sentimentality without undermining resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breaths caught like pearls in a glass bottle") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("rivers of light") to urgent ("whispered command"). Zero POV slippage, though "cyclically spontaneous" repetition slightly dulls texture in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("sensory maps pulsed stronger here, each line now a bridge" advances plot/theme). Figurative language avoids muddle even in climax ("walls dissolved into a cascade of light"), with final line recharging shard motif without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sensory mapping as literal world-weaving avoids sci-fi tropes through "weight of withheld truth" moral calculus. Shard’s role transforms "parallel universes" into organic stakes-shifter, with risk-taking heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
