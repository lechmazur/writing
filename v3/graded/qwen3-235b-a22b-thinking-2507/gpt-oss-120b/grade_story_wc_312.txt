<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in "earnestly naive" belief vs. fragile loyalty lacks sufficient on-page tension; micro-choices under pressure (dripping rate measurement) reveal values but emotional progression remains tidily resolved without visible struggle during the repair climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the bell's restoration creates Charged Poise where cosmic tilt correction and river revival manifest cost through the "ghostly echo" of the last caught fish swimming upstream—a tangible, felt price for rebalancing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: its dripping mist directly constrains the mage's method (dripping rates as metronome) and charges the final image where sunrise refracts through the bell, making environment integral to both tactic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—dripping rhythm alignment narrows options to a single resonant pulse—but cost legibility falters; the "ghostly echo" fish is potent yet insufficiently foregrounded as a trade-off against the river's revival during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "brittle devotion" reweights from fragility to cosmic key in the final realization, avoiding moralizing; the "plausible impossibility" of lukewarm magic mending the universe offers non-literal answer to endurance vs. fragility without abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in mist-dripping measurements as heartbeat cadence; rhythmic control under pressure ("Each new droplet struck... fragments seemed to remember") avoids syntactic monotony while teaching the accumulative pattern early for the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "rivulet of water traced the viaduct's stones" simultaneously advances setting, atmosphere, and dripping-rate motif—but "frozen river of light" risks stock metaphor in opening, narrowly avoiding figurative muddle under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "lukewarm magic" trope: specificity of dripping-rate methodology transforms cosmic repair into tactile, human-scale endeavor; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes through resonant reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
