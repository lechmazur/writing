<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion ("luminescent ache") and micro-choices (stone carvings), but "contradictory impulses" lack simultaneous tension; the safety/bottling motivation is clear yet internal conflict stays contemplative rather than visceral during pivotal lamp-out moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: stone spiral's pulse when lamp dies reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (light now carried inward), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors ("crumbling beacon," "haunted lantern room") by line 3 serve the disorientation payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea glass and stone spiral function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("tiny lighthouse in his pocket"); "iron ribs" and "cold stone slab" provide tactile specificity, though "haunted" leans slightly generic without deeper environmental constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Marek's agency: lamp failure tightens stakes, forcing ritual adaptation; visible cost ("luminescent ache settling like a tide") forecloses reliance on external light, but the single deepening lacks sharper trade-offs beyond emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—sea glass reweighted from "trapped sunrise" to "talisman"—avoiding moralizing; final image ("lantern room glowed... from collective memory") resonates as non-literal answer to "can hope endure darkness?" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant," noting "sigh of wind against iron ribs") modulates rhythm under pressure, but "luminescent ache" repetition creates slight cadence rigidity; voice remains coherent though minor register drift occurs in "fragile chain of feelings."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "luminescent ache" in peak beats risks overwritten abstraction; no loops, yet "ghostly light"/"faint echo" proximity edges toward cliché without sufficient textural distinction in high-pressure lamp-out sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse tropes via stone-spiral ritual transforms familiar material; emotional specificity ("bottle the feeling of safety") avoids quirkiness, though "haunted" setting slightly relies on established convention without radical reimagining.</comment>
