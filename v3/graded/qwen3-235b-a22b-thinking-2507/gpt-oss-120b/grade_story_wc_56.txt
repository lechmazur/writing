<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses ("serene upheaval of purpose" vs dismantling lies) but "diagnostic label-speak" ("thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval") undermines embodied emotion; motivation remains abstract despite micro-choices with the sundial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Orientation debt: "twilight barge canal" lacks geographic anchors past 120 words, capping Q3 at 7.0; closure (Charged Poise) has conceptual cost but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Situational) weakens causality in pivotal lock scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Canal water functions as micro-setting that charges closure ("portal where past falsehoods could be salvaged"), but spatial choreography falters—rusted lock mechanics lack tactile specificity during the critical repair sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via "architecture of lies" unraveling, but cost remains abstract; "serene upheaval" lacks visceral trade-off despite the sundial’s physical use—pressure tightens but price isn’t unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic echo in final paragraph ("salvage not only the lock, but the narrative") triggers -0.6 penalty; "truth measured by invisible hand" offers conceptual repricing but moral complexity feels glib without earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water reflected like mirror of memory") with rhythmic control, but uniform "He [verb]" cadence in climax beats dulls immediacy; no head-hopping but psychic distance flattens under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Template cadence in pivotal lock scene ("He drew... He lifted... He moved... He realized") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty; "thoughtfully clear" synonym churn obscures closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally per rubric rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "woven falsehoods" architecture with sundial mechanics, but "Liar’s Cathedral" trope lacks transformation; specificity in canal water’s reflective symbolism elevates, though risk-taking avoids gimmickry.</comment>
