<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shown through bone-setting micro-choices, but "shrewdly innocent" label recurs without embodied tradeoffs. Diagnostic phrasing in "forgiving skeptic" triggers -0.4 penalty despite credible journal reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "cleft now a gateway" and marrow's "new map of belief." Accumulative lens holds through vertebrae clicks becoming symphony notes, though no persistent constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Garden functions as active constraint: tooth's curve matching vertebrae directly enables the repair. Final "shy light" charges closure with micro-setting specificity, satisfying 9+ gate through recurring object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via textural escalation—hollow ribs narrowing to gateway—but tooth's efficacy relies on coincidence rather than earned mechanics. Agency clear in Mara's hands navigating bones, though cost remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Mistakes are dark matter" journal entry avoids final-paragraph moralizing, reweighting the cleft concept through concrete action. Resonant answer emerges from tooth-to-galaxy transformation without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "midnight perfume" and "brittle bones," but "shrewdly innocent" repetition creates tic under pressure. Rhythmic control strong despite lyric mode compressions taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density weakens climax: "glowing point of possibility," "melody of repair," and "embryonic galaxy" stack without pattern-teaching. No closure artifacts, but synonym churn in "shrewdly innocent" repetitions dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms bone-setting trope through cosmic repair metaphor ("coaxing stars"). Risk-taking heightens stakes via "nostalgic innovation" synthesis, though changeling tooth risks derivative resonance without specific lived detail.</comment>
