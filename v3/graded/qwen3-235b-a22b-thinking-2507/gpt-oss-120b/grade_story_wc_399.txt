<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "strangely honest" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs. Embodied emotion shines ("echo settle like dew") but micro-choices lack escalation toward closure. Prophet functions as prop, not pressure source.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: dunes shifting into footpaths crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("sand stretched beyond horizon"). Minor deduction for no visible stake escalation despite strong lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting (kinetic parapet) constrains consecration but fails to charge final image. Sensory hierarchy masterful ("pillars humming like wind through reeds"), yet murmuring pavilion remains ornamental rather than tactical pressure point. Caps at 8.8 per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve echo") stays abstract without dramatized cost escalation. Prophet's arrival creates tension but no narrowing of options; consecration feels inevitable rather than pressured choice. Accumulative density compensates for weak causal escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "peripheral awareness" motif without moralizing. Final stars-as-teachings image reweights "fleeting oasis" question with undeniable conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo despite Keeper's explanation; wisdom's fragility resonates through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "sand shift beneath boots" and "flickering light" reflections. Rhythmic control under pressure exceptional ("breath as soft as sand slipping"). Minor register drift in "consecrate" (ritualistic vs character voice) prevents 10.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats but "conjured clearing" repetition (4x in 80 words) triggers −0.3 loop penalty. Textural specificity triumphs ("whisperfield calm", "violet robes"), yet synonym churn on "peripheral awareness" dulls closure's final impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms desert mystic tropes via kinetic parapet mechanics and half-masked specificity. "Dunes shifting into footpaths" image synthesizes theme with earned risk. Emotional truth in wisdom's fragility avoids spiritual clichés through tactile consecration ritual.</comment>
