<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete observation driving action (sorting fragments by scent/ink), but lacks contradictory impulses in peak pressure; motivation clear though emotional complexity remains underdeveloped during storm climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Mira’s placement of the diamond crystallizes the stillpoint’s true nature with visible cost ("weight of responsibility"); causal chain (fragments→map→revelation) holds tightly under Causal lens with radiation’s dissolution as conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard’s radiation actively constrains choices (working under lantern during storms) and charges the final image (dust ceasing as truth "blooms"); micro-setting (rusted table, phosphorescent fruit) shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency (reassembling fragments narrows search), but the epiphany feels slightly convenient; cost is legible in her responsibility shift though internal tension lacks sufficient friction during critical moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the diamond’s inscription and Mira’s actions, avoiding moralizing; final image ("truth could bloom") resonates as a non-literal answer to "comfortable lies" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes darted across chaotic script") reflects Mira’s observational nature; rhythmic control shifts with pressure (short sentences during storm), no head-hopping, and lyrical compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("shredded letters, torn from old corporate memos") with concrete propulsion. Minor deduction: "pulse in the air" borders cliché but redeemed by immediate physical consequence ("world held its breath").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transforms "cursed object" trope through scientific framing (radiation stillpoint) and psychological resolution; avoids middle-ground hedging but risks undercut by slightly pat epiphany in final realization.</comment>
