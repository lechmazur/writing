<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation ("sweet and dangerous as rosewater") lacks contradictory impulses; interiority remains abstract ("dread," "intoxicating") without embodied conflict. Mute potter/X-poet are ornamental, failing relationship-as-crucible test despite strong cultural stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: dread "melts like sugar" amid bittersweet acceptance, with conceptual cost of displacement legible in "imprint their initials upon the world’s crust." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto’s stone veins "glowing with revived talent" charge the final image, while rosewater dread evolves from "wilted lilies" to "bittersweet acceptance," constraining Liora’s ritual and the murals’ "exhale." Micro-setting (bread initials) shapes identity stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Escalation via Liora’s ritual (bread → lens light → artisans rehearsing) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but "thaw" agency feels diffuse; cost ("lost craft took displaced souls") is conceptual yet insufficiently visceral in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through bread initials and lens refracting hope: "true rescue lay not in preserving objects but in thawing hearts" reweights displacement into "art could breathe again" without moralizing. Final image answers central question with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice has distinct texture ("air tasted of mist and wilted lilies"), but POV slips occur ("beekeeper’s ghost, lingering"). Perceptual signature shines in lens magnifying "ghost of memory," though "rosewater dread" repetition borders on tic under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "anxiety melting like frost" shows rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in "emerald-tinted lens caught a flash of emerald light," but density serves Accumulative lens without muddling closure’s "prism of hope" image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesizes displacement tropes via fresh details (bread initials, honeyed sorrow), avoiding derivative safety. "Rosewater dread" transforms from wilted lilies to bittersweet acceptance, but risks poetic abstraction without deeper moral calculus.</comment>
