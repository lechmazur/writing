<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong (scars as failures vs. healing), but micro-choices lack pressure-driven hierarchy; "unfinished symbols" risks diagnostic phrasing without sufficient embodied struggle in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost (dissolving shards = released trauma), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks one decisive intensification to narrow options before climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tea platform and crow quill function as micro-setting that constrains ritual choices and charges closure; "moonstone steaming jasmine" actively slows time perception, shaping the final image's renewal hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scar transformation) signaled early, but pressure accumulates without meaningful tightening; ritual proceeds smoothly without setbacks that would force adaptation or deepen cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (scars→luminous runes), but "youthful superstitions" method slightly echoes thematic intent without sufficient friction in the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (rune scholar's glyph-filtered observations) with rhythmic control; lyrical compression of "breath between storms" taught early and paid off in final sigh without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("saturated hush" repetition) and slight overwriting in high-pressure beats ("suspended breath of floating rock"), but no artifacts dull closure's luminous runes image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual tropes through specific constraints (quill's stress-crystallization), though premise slightly derivative; emotional specificity in "scars not erased but transformed" elevates beyond template.</comment>
