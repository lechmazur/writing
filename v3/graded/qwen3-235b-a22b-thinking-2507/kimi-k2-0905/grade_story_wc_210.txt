<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("integrity of endings" vs communal wishes) manifests physically in bottle confrontation; embodied cost in burning lanterns rejects comfort without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: bottle cooling "defeated" while ashes become ink for "remember imperfectly" scroll crystallizes irreversible trade-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (lanterns) charges closure: reed frames evolve from memory vessels to ash for new ink, constraining every choice from recipe retrieval to ritual design.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: bottle confrontation forces "burn memories" ritual, narrowing options with visible cost (rejecting bottled comfort for kinetic memory).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final scroll’s "remember imperfectly" reweights theme non-literally; avoids moralizing by embedding insight in action (ash-ink), rejecting resurrection myths through charged particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: alchemist’s "retort" metaphor for memory shapes syntax; rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("paper blooming into orange petals that lifted").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "gray spiral" ash image demonstrates textural specificity; strategic density in "copper wire to flagpole" compresses history without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy/memory mechanics avoids trope; risk-taking in burning rituals heightens stakes, though gulls-to-bylaws feels slightly forced.</comment>
