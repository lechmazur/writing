<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Arin’s embodied motivation (dust as ancestral breath) and micro-choice (turning handle despite blood cost) earn closure, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; tears-to-mud specificity avoids label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (blood treaty, name burned clean) under Accumulative/Textural lens; standing waves to confession to public revelation tightens pressure via density increase.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sepia dust and brass handle constrain choices (kneeling, bloodied map wrap) and charge the final image (bloodied page as lantern); sensory hierarchy (taste of brass/rain) reflects urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Arin’s agency (turning handle against Muse’s warning), with visible cost (bloody wound), but "prepared to lose your name" lacks escalation of the dominant truth-uncovering stake before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (blood-ink map, river flowers on statues), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "dynasty ender" as bridge-builder without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust like powdered light," "ghost-frequency that tasted of brass") with rhythmic control; "eloquently silent" refrain taught early and paid off in Muse’s gesture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("click echoing like a cell door closing") with clear propulsion, though "standing waves" metaphor risks abstraction but is anchored by physical tremors in carpet.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography/confession tropes through specific tools (atlas page as bandage); risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
