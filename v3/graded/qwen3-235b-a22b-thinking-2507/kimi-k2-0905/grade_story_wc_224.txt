<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via embodied emotion ("memory hurt because every prophecy chained another friend"), but custodian interaction lacks layered status dynamics; micro-choices under pressure (feather-guided turns) reveal values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stone sinking seals talents while seeding communal memory, with cost legible in "thunder rolling quietly behind her eyes" under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by word 10.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crow feather) constrains choices throughout and charges final image; "storm-cloud suede" folio and basalt walls evolve causally with pressure, avoiding static description through tactile navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when custodian demands reburial, forcing renunciation; cost is unmistakable in shattered talents and sealed stone, driven by seer's agency under Accumulative lens with lightning strike as earned consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "seed yourself where they cannot name you" reframed by final stone-sinking—a resonant, non-literal answer to memory ownership without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in mercury-glass scrying ("reflecting not her face but the town"); rhythmic control under pressure ("syllables older than air") with no head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "sparrow’s heart" metaphor recharges closure; sentence rhythm accelerates during lightning strike ("spilling books in a cataract of burning alphabets") without muddying causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms seer trope via "mercury-glass skin catching rising sun" as non-oracle; bold structural compression makes labyrinthine logic inevitable; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
