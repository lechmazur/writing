<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses crystallize in the "third path" choice, with visible cost in the key's worn teeth. "Logically emotional" calculus isn't labeled—it drives the pivotal tradeoff between marina destruction and nightmare proliferation, embodied in her heartbeat syncing to "ice’s slow centuries."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands unmistakably: shadows soften into "luminous with forgiven longing" silhouettes while the marina remains intact, with cost legible in the key’s "teeth worn smooth as river stones." Orientation anchors within 40 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sonic escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The crypt keeper’s key functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (driving it into the pier) and charging closure as a "sleeping child." Sensory hierarchy reflects Mireya’s whale-song attunement ("ice remembered when it was glacier"), with the marina’s calving ice actively forcing the third-path solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Mireya’s vibrational agency under Accumulative lens: her tempo shifts narrow options to the third path, with cost undeniable in the calving ice and key’s "teeth glowing like coals." Stakes deepen from abstract nightmare suppression to literal spatial collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vibrational matching—teaching darkness to "listen instead of consume"—with the final star-spiral image offering non-literal absolution. No moralizing; cost is embodied in "tears that tasted of salt, iron, and whale song," reweighting mercy as active sonic labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is whale-song attuned ("micro-shrieks only she could detect"), with rhythm modulating under pressure: staccato during crisis ("shadows slid closer"), fluid during resolution. Zero head-hopping; deep third consistently filters reality through sonic engineering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "fleshly ethereal" risks overwriting but is anchored by concrete "salt and iron" sensory payoff. Final line’s rhythm ("coat carried the horizon’s last gold") crystallizes closure without abstraction. Minor register drift in "fleshly ethereal" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sonic absolution transforms lighthouse tropes into ecological-emotional calculus. The "third path" solution feels inevitable yet fresh, with vibrational matching synthesizing engineering and mercy. Avoids safety middle by making darkness’s transformation hinge on precise, character-specific frequency work.</comment>
