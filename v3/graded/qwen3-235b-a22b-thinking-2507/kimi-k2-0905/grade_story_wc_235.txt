<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (envying past selves while kneeling in snow), but "grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live" edges toward abstract label-speak, slightly undermining visceral impact at a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: snow dissolving the scroll makes "erasure is also a form of continuation" legible with conceptual cost ("chaos settle into something almost bearable"), under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens taught by the scroll's unraveling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Snow functions as micro-setting that constrains the ending—kneeling on it to let the scroll vanish charges the final image, while "moonlight so sharp it sliced the snow into blue glass" filters environment through the chronicler's fractured perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (escaping time's wheel) tightens when the eagle flight reveals her body "still in bed," forcing the earned renunciation of narrative control—stepping into moonlight forecloses the path of "landing" with visible cost in the "almost bearable" chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: snow dissolving words reweights time as cyclical without moralizing, while "map its spokes, to name the splinters" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("lungs full of cedar smoke," syntax fragmenting under stress: "She knelt. Laid the birch bark."), with rhythmic control heightening pressure—lyric compression in the eagle flight taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels ("sparks write brief constellations on the iron door" conveys setting, emotion, and theme), with figurative language precise ("edges curled like autumn tongues") and no muddle even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lucid dreaming tropes through specific, grounded details—the chronicler's job distilling "rabid dreams," jealousy of "the corpse asleep in the future grave"—where risk-taking (nonlinear time) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
