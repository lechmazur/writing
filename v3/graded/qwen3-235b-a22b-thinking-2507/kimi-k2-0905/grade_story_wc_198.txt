<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied contradictions (moth-flutter reed vs. copper chord), but secondary pressure from villagers lacks on-page friction; micro-choices under prophecy pressure earn high marks despite off-screen antagonists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: backward note erasing prophecy's consonant carries undeniable conceptual cost (time's gate unlocked), with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding through erasure's ripple effects on grotto/prism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prism atrium and saxophone bell function as micro-settings charging closure: distorted reflections in dewdrops constrain identity choice while reweighting the final image's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency (diminished chord forcing hush retreat), but prophecy's death-date threat lacks tangible mid-scene cost escalation; sun's finger-width climb provides sufficient narrowing under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through negative space mechanics: "spaces between sounds" reweights prophecy's power, with final walk through negative space offering resonant, non-literal answer to bargaining-with-fate premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in saxophonist's brass-filtered reality ("reed flutter like trapped moth"); rhythmic control intensifies during prophecy pushback without line-level artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Dewdrops form" refrain risks template cadence but earns purpose through prophecy linkage; minor synonym churn ("quietly vivid" repetition) deducts 0.3 despite otherwise immaculate propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prophecy-as-sleeping-animal transforms tropes through sonic physics, but "copper and rust" chord leans on familiar synesthesia; prism atrium's spectral voices elevate to 8.8 via fresh constraint.</comment>
