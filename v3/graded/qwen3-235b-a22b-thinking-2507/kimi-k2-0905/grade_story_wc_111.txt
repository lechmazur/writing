<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("tasted every season... compressed into perfect sweetness") and embodied emotion avoids clichés, but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; the deception realization feels accepted rather than wrestled with under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("moving to another room in a house that had been hers") crystallizes the symbiotic relationship with undeniable cost—the marbles' warmth and glove ritual prove the garden's recognition, making the deception's collapse legible through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden maze actively pressures choices (shifting hedges create the apple grove path), while marbles function as micro-setting objects charging the finale; sensory details like "spider-silk cloth" are purposeful, though climate-specific horticultural constraints could deepen tactical relevance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes (control vs. servitude) deepen through the 0.03% score forcing Elara's ritual, culminating in the apple grove reversal where the garden's agency proves her deception; cost is visceral in her shifted understanding that "broken things... become maps," driven entirely by her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the apple tasting "every season" compresses decades into sensory truth—avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights "mended deception" as mutual dance without stating a moral, achieving earned resonance through the glove ritual's quiet symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("heirloom tomatoes to dream of rain") and rhythmic control shine, though "understood this place wisely pragmatic" slightly disrupts voice with diagnostic phrasing; compression is taught early (marbles' fractured memories) and pays off in the glove ritual's closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character ("marbles clinking softly" implies ritual history), with final line's "raised her gloved hand" charging closure; only microscopic deduction for "wisely pragmatic" phrasing momentarily flattening immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "garden as metaphor" through specific mechanics (luck scores, cracked marbles as broken-memory talismans); the "blooming withering cycle" concept feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (lyric structure) heightening emotional stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
