<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Quince’s superposition of astronomer’s logic and widow’s grief; micro-choices like tasting "hunger for pattern" versus "hunger for presence" reveal irrevocable trade-offs with visceral cost at the reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "heart blank as unprinted paper" crystallizes the conceptual cost of releasing borrowed souls, with the restored sky reweighting the premise under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Topaz dome and halo fragment constrain choices (press reversal) and charge the final image—cracked fragment in pocket embodies the theme’s "release," fulfilling the 9+ gate through micro-setting necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalation falters slightly in mid-beat as Quince absorbs the astronomer’s calculus; the pressure deepens meaningfully but the "spectral tears" vision lacks immediate tactical consequence before the balcony climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final line’s "mathematics of emotion ends not in proof but in release" reweights the entire premise as a non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing while crystallizing the theme through the halo’s transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "leaden fractions of sense," "gears clicking out half-truths in Morse" reflect Quince’s printer-mind; rhythmic control peaks with "ink flowed uphill, letters lifted" during reversal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lucid turbulence" slightly abstract but justified by voice—only minor deduction as it doesn’t dull the closure’s "weightless and suddenly terrifying" charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of letterpress mechanics and emotional transposition feels inevitable; "vanishing stars gathered into a radiant variable" transforms cliché into fresh, high-stakes imagery without abstraction.</comment>
