<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (past war chronicle attempt vs. present witness role), but climax lacks layered hesitation; transformation into swan is earned through library's rules, though micro-choices under pressure could deepen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "mirror-water bore her weight without ripple" crystallizes the keeper's erasure; accumulative lens holds via density shifts (paper cranes dissolving, silence pooling), though lens inference could tighten earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian lectern and mirror-water function as micro-settings that constrain the climax—stepping onto the water recharges the river refuge's meaning; "scales knitting into wings" charges the final image with irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving non-interference) tighten through accumulative pressure, but protagonist agency remains passive; cost is visceral ("edges soften," memories drain), yet escalation lacks clear protagonist-driven causality per Q4's quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the swan's evolution into the keeper's new form, avoiding moralizing; the final feather and silence offer resonant non-literal answer, though "fold the world into a shape that holds no weight" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("river damp," "parchment leaves budding"); rhythm modulates perfectly with library's breath-like cadence, though "regenerative silence" slightly drifts into academic register during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "saw no reflection" delivers crystalline closure imagery. Minor repetition of "river damp" in closure beat (lines 12/36) borders on synonym churn but doesn't obscure cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms library tropes via obsidian scales and moon-berries ink; emotional truth in surrender avoids abstraction. Freshness anchored in specific mechanics (scrolls regenerating into blankness), though keeper-becomes-myth arc has familiar echoes.</comment>
