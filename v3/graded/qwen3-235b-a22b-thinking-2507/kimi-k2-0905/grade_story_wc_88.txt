<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority excels with "delicately robust yearning" embodying contradiction, but the dirty past lacks concrete specifics to fully root motivation. Final choice to absorb pain feels earned through lake visions, yet vague backstory weakens the "inevitable mistakes" requirement for high-band scores.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: "shoes filling with cold fire" crystallizes empathy as "consent to fracture." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each lake image deepens stakes without causal gaps, and the water's "borrowed rhythms" reconfigures the seeker's identity with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake charges closure as micro-setting—glow under skin illuminates bones like "paper lanterns," directly constraining the seeker's final stance. Storm drains lack similar pressure, but the baseball's orbiting constellations and "wet silence" elevate specificity beyond vivid description into active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: choosing diagonals in the drains, then wading into the lake's bargain. The dominant stake (redeeming guilt) tightens through the lake's visceral cost—"nausea: smell of bleach masking blood"—with the heart-skip moment foreclosing the hollow-man path decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like "ticket stubs to games that never happened," avoiding moralizing. Yet "redemption isn’t a doorway; it’s a turnstile" edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting the final image's resonance as a non-literal answer to the empathy question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "nurses spoke in pastels" and "silence felt wet," but late metaphors like "bones like paper lanterns" drift into overwrought register. Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though minor syntactic repetition ("stitching constellations," "stitches would imprint") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose excels in rhythm ("He pocketed the sports page, stole an orderly’s coat") but suffers minor loops: "stitches would imprint... stitching constellations" risks synonym churn. No closure artifacts, yet "conceptual repricing" phrasing in the lake's bargain slightly disrupts POV lexicon during peak tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms memory-erasure tropes through "obituaries bled ink" and time-loop mechanics, but "labyrinth of choices" (left=forgiveness etc.) feels unoriginal. Risk-taking elevates stakes via the bioluminescent lake's non-linear empathy, though the "diagonals" path lacks sufficient groundwork for maximum freshness.</comment>
