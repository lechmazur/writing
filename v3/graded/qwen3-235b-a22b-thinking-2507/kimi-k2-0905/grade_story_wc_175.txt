<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation for honoring overlooked histories remains abstractly stated ("I'm building this for the histories that dissolve") without contradictory impulses or visible internal struggle; grandmother's quote explains rather than shows conflicted commitment. Embodied emotion lacks specificity beyond "crying" with indeterminate cause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: butterfly arrivals deepen meaning through density increase ("living shroud" transforming the memorial), culminating in Charged Poise closure where dissolving wire carries stories upward with undeniable conceptual cost ("cargo of stories that now migrated across skies"). Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cloud-soil dissolving by nightfall actively constrains Elara's urgency, while the moth wing's "curling edges" charges the final image ("feeling the ghost of its texture"). Environment shapes tactics—fern fronds become structural elements—and final starlight catch reweights the grotto's transience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: dissolving cloud-soil creates deadline pressure, deepening when butterflies transform the memorial into "something breathing," forcing Elara to accelerate her weaving. Cost is legible in the memorial's dissolution ("lift piece by piece") and her ambiguous tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the midwife/librarian stories reflected in butterfly eyes—not abstraction. Final image ("silver wire caught starlight... wings that would never land") reweights "temporary permanence" as weightless migration without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("blushing stillness," "mechanical hunger of time") modulates under pressure: rhythm accelerates during butterfly landing ("weightless yet somehow anchoring"). Zero head-hopping; "esoteric realist" label slightly abstract but anchored by wire-weaving actions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or theme ("bowl of emerald ferns suspended in sky" conveys urgency and beauty simultaneously). Final line’s "bl" truncation taught early as "blushing stillness," enhancing closure without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms butterfly symbolism through specific mechanics: knotting wire as "temporary structures" reframes ephemerality as active preservation. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes ("living shroud" intensifying memorial’s purpose) without gimmickry; avoids sentimentality through precise cost ("imprint of her knees... already beginning to fade").</comment>
