<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s trembling "nervously confident" hands—simultaneous fear/legacy-pull embodied via copper nail’s coffin origin. Final renunciation (staying to catalog) earns cost through generational stakes in the helm-log reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "Return is exile seen from the other deck" reweights the Act’s meaning with visceral cost (verdigris thumbprint linking sacrifice to saved lives). Accumulative lens holds through stanza-decoding pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weather Station’s mildew and spongey plankwalk constrain choices (journals stink of kelp; glass walls become map canvases). Final image charges setting as living library—environment directly shapes closure’s "memory refracted across purposeful rain."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Voss admits his brother’s loss, forcing Mara’s question: "What bravery is so inconvenient we erase its coordinates?" Cost crystallizes in the helm-log’s verdigris signature—bravery literally saved the Ministry’s own ancestors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: copper nail’s coffin origin mirrors "bravery and burial separated by one thin board." Final image ("truth the wind must remember") resonates without moralizing, reweighting erasure as active remembrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature gleams in "barometers screamed" and "kelp stench as first honest thing." Voice modulates under pressure—lyric decoding stanzas shift to terse dirigible action ("clutched the copper nail so tightly it imprinted her palm").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "verdigris thumbprint" crystallizes motif without overwriting. Final line’s "reversible as breath, eternal as weather" achieves rhythmic propulsion while charging closure—no artifacts dull the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes exile/weather/memory into fresh "library whose shelves could never mildew." Risk-taking (coded stanzas as maps) heightens stakes organically—the jet stream’s shift becomes both setting and moral compass.</comment>
