<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s "affectionate skepticism" manifests concretely in muttering to the geode, driving her shift from privacy-seeking to active solution-building; Mrs. Chen’s test lacks embodied cost, weakening the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (community trauma), but the final image’s "hope solidified" lacks visible felt consequence; Accumulative lens holds via density of light patterns tightening mental privacy stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Light studio functions as micro-setting: projectors/mirrors constrain Mira’s photographic choices, and the final "beacon for silence" image charges closure by reweighting the space’s purpose through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mental privacy) tightens via Mira’s agency—photographing patterns evolves into devising shields—but cost remains abstract; Mrs. Chen’s relief implies rather than viscerally shows the anguish it resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "hidden pathways" motif evolving from light refraction to thought-shields; final image ("trusting science and intuition") reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice shows Mira’s perceptual signature ("fractally precise movements"), but "willowglass hope" feels author-imposed rather than character-particular; rhythmic control falters during the pill-recall reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with clean propulsion, but "fractally precise" repeats within 50 words (synonym churn); no figurative muddle, though "teeth ache" lacks specificity in high-pressure static shock beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mineralogy and mental health crisis: "thought-shields" feel inevitable from muscovite’s properties, with risk-taking (somatic markers as solution) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
