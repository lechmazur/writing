<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost bride's interiority shines through concrete details ("hollow where her face should have been"), but boy's ancestral guilt lacks contradictory impulses; his sudden understanding of the orchard's purpose feels unearned despite strong embodied choices like offering his wrist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully when the greenhouse dissolves and she touches earth—"yanking the guilt out of his blood like a splinter of iron" makes cost visceral. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through the ripening fruit and accelerating bead pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard isn't backdrop but active constraint: silver fruit becoming currency directly shapes the climax. The cracked stone bead charging the final image ("seed warm against his lifeline") satisfies the 9+ gate by charging closure through micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Debt-as-vine stake tightens through the seven nights with escalating cost (frost on lashes → bead in heart), but the boy's sudden comprehension of the orchard's purpose lacks causal escalation; agency shifts feel abrupt rather than deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bead's transformation—"debts can become gifts" crystallizes in the final planting act without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding "resonant awakenings" in physical stakes (bead's pulse) rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: ghost notices "frost gather on lashes" while boy perceives "eyes black as sky." Minor register drift when "resonant awakening" appears clinically in peak beats slightly dulls the ghost's voice like broken bells.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "hush of winter-cracked fields" repeats verbatim (synonym churn risk), and "resonant awakening" appears three times with diminishing texture. No closure impact, but prevents 9.0 under tightened artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transcends ghost-debt tropes via alchemical mechanics—orchard as crucible where sorrow becomes fruit is a fresh synthesis. Risk-taking (Earned Stasis closure) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, avoiding safety middle through specific "steam and starlight" logic.</comment>
