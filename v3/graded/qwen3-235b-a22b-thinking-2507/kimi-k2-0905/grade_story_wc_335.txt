<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's embodied contradiction (fear-driven backwards walk vs. defiant spitting) and micro-choices under pressure (sealing exile clauses) earn her renunciation. Child's passivity slightly weakens secondary pressure but single-POV focus holds interiority tight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: library's "exhale" and teacup's mended circle reconfigure exile with undeniable cost (Lira becoming "next text"). Orientation perfect; Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first shard-scatter to final honey-sliding shadow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library's sentient shelves and ghost swing actively constrain choices (backwards navigation through collapsing stacks). Teacup's evolving tea leaves charge the final image—environment shapes tactics and closure without symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: sealing exile clauses with backwards circuits directly forecloses her return path. Cost crystallizes when mentor's erased name "burrows into the glass"—conceptual price made visceral through shard-mirror physiology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tea-leaf geometry and backwards walking; final annotation ("path agrees to follow you") reweights opening "hush" without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence—Lira's memory sacrifice carries irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "shadow caught in glass above lintel" filters time through archivist's lens. Syntax compresses under stress ("spat into dust—combative tenderness") while maintaining rhythmic control through ritualistic movements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line multi-tasks ("mirror shards... scattering three o'clock across cracked spines" advances setting, character, theme). Final honey-sliding shadow recharges opening with devastating precision—no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope via shard-mirrors and tea-leaf divination. "Walking backwards as resistance" synthesizes setting/stakes with emotional truth—specificity (three o'clock shadows, bronze plaque) avoids genericness while risking unconventional structure.</comment>
