<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arlo’s "spark of defiance" motivation is concrete in micro-choices (palming seed, twisting tendril), but Voss lacks depth as pure pressure. Interior contradiction—scholarly charm vs. taxed dreams—drives action yet lacks visceral emotional layering during peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: seeds planted, "Resist" vine blooming, cost is the Revenue Bureau’s ever-present threat. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via escalating sensory pressure, but satellite pass timing lacks felt consequence on Arlo’s immediate tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting actively constrains choices (hiding from drone, soil depth precision) and charges closure via firefly-readable "Resist." Orchid bees as "tax auditors" and moonlit soil filter perception through Arlo’s urgency, avoiding symbolic cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thought taxation vs. rebellion) tightens via satellite deadline, narrowing Arlo’s options. Escalation is agency-driven (planting seed, activating pollen), but cost remains atmospheric—Voss’s near-miss lacks irreversible loss or tactical shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "candidly cryptic" glyphs and bees carrying "subversive pollen," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "taxed imaginings" into refunded dreams without stating a moral, though "stand guard over your spark" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors" reflects Arlo’s scholarly defiance. Voice modulates under pressure (compressed syntax during drone sweep), though Lucretius quote risks academic register clash without deeper character justification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose propels with "gourd rattle seed clicked like a clock counting down to chaos," but "candidly cryptic" repeats three times, creating near-synonym churn. Final image’s "untaxed thought unfurl" avoids overwriting yet edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical resistance and thought taxation avoids dystopian clichés. "Living patterns" language club transforms tropes, though "charming rogue" archetype slightly limits character surprise. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
