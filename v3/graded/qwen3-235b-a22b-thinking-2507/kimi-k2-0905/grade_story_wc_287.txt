<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: theft as "translation," knuckle-whitening pressure on brass tooth. Final petal gift over stolen tool earns endurance with tangible cost in its dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: boy’s descent "with rhythm of oars" crystallizes reconfigured stakes. Harbor’s phosphorescence motif pays off in "small reflected moon," making conceptual cost undeniable through light-as-courage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (watering can’s empty slosh) constrains stealth tactics; harbor’s diesel-starfish air charges final image. Moonlight evolves from blade simile to "scatter of seeds," directly shaping Mara’s resourcefulness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (lighting dark corners) tightens through Mara’s agency: gauge tooth theft → lockpicking → petal revelation. Cost crystallizes in the dissolving petal’s dust riding "into corridors still waiting for light."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: "harbor water reflects a lantern on a departing mast" refracts emotion through setting. Rhythmic control peaks in lockpicking beat ("pull, lift, glide"), with lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "papery petal lay like eviction notice" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Figurative language ("blade pressed flat against skin") remains precise in high-pressure beats without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "urban gardener" trope through lockmaster’s tooth mechanics and harbor’s oar-rhythm motif. Fresh inflection: nasturtium rooting in gutter where tool fell, synthesizing theft with reckless hope.</comment>
