<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in "crimes I could not name" vs. "come back whole," but the brother's frozen state limits relationship crucible depth despite poignant micro-choices with the shard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "words did not echo; they seeded" reconfigures the apology's cost with the lip cut healing in moonlight, fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through visceral reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mangroves constrain choice ("roots that never quite touched") while the shard charges the final image; "heals in moonlight" evolves from description to active mechanism altering tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the shard's transformation, narrowing options to the corridor moment; cost is unmistakable in the narrator's lip cut healing only after speaking the apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard's metamorphosis and moths carrying syllables; the final line reweights "fierce tenderness" as path not destination without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hair dripping tide-pool silver") and rhythmic control peak in the corridor scene; elision of brother's backstory taught early and paid off in the window revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density ("paper lungs collapsed around verbs too sharp to inhale"); single minor register drift in "twenty-seven" slightly muddles peak apology moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms apology trope through concrete mechanics (shard → glass → breath); "mangroves exhale" reprise feels inevitable yet fresh, risking lyricism without obscuring stakes.</comment>
