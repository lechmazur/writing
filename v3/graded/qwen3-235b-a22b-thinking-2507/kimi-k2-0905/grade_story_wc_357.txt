<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied choices (clutching arrow, memory offering) avoids stock phrasing, though near-label in resilience realization risks thematic echo; contradiction between childhood trauma and present endurance earns change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (memories drawn outward); Accumulative lens holds through density shift during inversion; orientation clear by first sentence anchors who/where/when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard planet constrains every choice (water navigation, gravity inversion); mossy bark shelf and arrow tip as micro-settings directly charge closure via sapling graft; specificity avoids generic worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via inversion’s live clock forcing stance crystallization; agency in arrow insertion drives closure, but water flow guidance slightly passive—pressure coherence strong yet one escalation nuance short of 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final blossom exhalation reweights "where does resilience come from?" non-literally without moralizing; theme emerges from sapling’s memory graft, avoiding thematic echo despite prompt-like closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water’s upward crawl," "whirling silence") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control flawless except minor register drift in "polished jade" during descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion impeccable through inversion sequence; single borderline metaphor ("kaleidoscopes") in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0 despite purposeful density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological resilience as echo-transfer avoids tropes; emotional specificity in loneliness and first crash elevates beyond surface novelty while honoring genre conventions.</comment>
