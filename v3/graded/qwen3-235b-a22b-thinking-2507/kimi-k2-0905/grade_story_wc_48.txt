<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s dual drive to hoard/abandon hopes; embodied cost in throat-closing confrontation with Lira. No diagnostic labels, but micro-choices lack one visible tradeoff beyond the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: offering shell back crystallizes cost (abandoning cynicism) under Accumulative lens. Orientation secured by line 3; mist-to-dawn progression tightens pressure without redundancy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Feral nexus isn’t backdrop but active constraint—tides deliver cameos, mist becomes quotation marks. Shell fragment evolves from ear trumpet to lighthouse, charging the final image with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (lost advance/lockout) tighten via protagonist’s agency: collecting then releasing hopes. Cost is felt in Lira’s accusation and the shell’s weight, but "against current" remains thematic rather than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: unfinished hopes as physical fragments. Final image reweights "collecting" as releasing without moralizing, though "hope was angular" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("marginalia" mist, "pages rubbed together" voice) stays consistent. Lyric compression taught early; no head-hopping despite multiple cameos. Rhythm modulates perfectly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "salt and wet paper" achieves high density. Minor overwriting risk in "hope was not bright or soft but angular," but shell’s transformation offsets it. Closure beat pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms writer’s-block trope via tidal nexus mechanics and hopes-as-physical-fragments. Emotional specificity in refugee boy’s freckle and pianist’s quartz grain avoids gimmickry, though "feral nexus" borders on familiar lyricism.</comment>
