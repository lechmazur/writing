<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in cartographer’s embodied perception: "flickered now" shows methodical curiosity destabilized by video’s "scream wearing silence." Final choice to carry "no footage" earns renunciation through tactile engagement with stone and film alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: silence reconfigured as "map framed upside-down" with visible cost in "carrying no footage." Accumulative lens holds through density buildup (rain, film, fresco layers) to crystallize stakes in final beam of stormlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice and charges closure: rain both erases work and "rinses the world," while the stone bench with "disciplined beam of stormlight" directly enables the final realization about silence as language.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: noticing the map tear aligns with henge shadow deepens knowledge, narrowing options to witnessing "the seam." Cost crystallizes in "shielded openness" as she sacrifices proof for understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: torn map’s "edges knitted together" reweights silence as language without moralizing. Final image (stone bench/stormlight) offers resonant answer to "unknown as inked continent" with no abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "painted saints seemed to lean forward, also trying to read the difference" filters action through cartographer’s eyes. Rhythm modulates from "soft hammer" rain to slackened "single note" without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mineral hush" exemplifies textural specificity. Every line advances atmosphere or character: "rain hissed... each drop a soft hammer erasing the day’s work" compresses sensory detail with causal pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "mysterious chapel" trope through cartographic lens: silence as "map framed upside-down" synthesizes setting and theme. Risk-taking (lyric structure over plot) heightens stakes without gimmickry or abstraction.</comment>
