<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest in micro-choices: labeling noise "dirge" risks punishment while narrating "watering of nothing" summons rain. Officer's late entrance creates meaningful pressure through his unbuttoned uniform and scratched badge, crystallizing the performer's endurance. Minor thinness in officer's motivation, but sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly; pressure tightens through sensory accumulation (shavings, turbine sounds, feather drop). Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost: the vanished tear leaves "soil darkened as if remembering rain," reconfiguring silence into potential song. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Wind turbines actively constrain choices—updraft snatches shavings, silence ordinance risks whittling. Dried bouquet evolves from "apologies no one accepted" to vessel for resurrection, charging the final image. Micro-setting (whittling stick) directly shapes tactics; all senses serve urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("Can lightness grow in grief?") escalates through Accumulative lens: each sensory addition (wooden feather, real tear) reweights options. Cost legible in the tear's vanishing yet transformative soil darkening. Agency is endurance/planting; officer's participation narrows paths meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "grief is soil" becomes literal with planted stems. Final image ("grief... might now be allowed to weigh something") reweights "remade hush" as potential song without moralizing. Crow's line ("guilt fits like a splinter") and officer's scratched badge carry earned subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "blade kisses the grain at seventeen-degree angle," "turbines choreographing remade hush." Voice modulates under pressure—flat narration shifts to active "repetition as sedative." Officer's dialogue ("You still believe...?") has clean distinction; rhythm varies with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density throughout ("turbines above snatched before they touched the ground" does triple duty). Final line's "flag for the morally ambiguous" recharges motif without abstraction. Minor abstraction in "emotional void" redeemed by immediate concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms dystopia: grief "cultivated" into weight enabling song, not cured. Whittling becomes rebellion via wooden feather in turbine joint. Specific details (joy coupons, seventeen-degree angle) avoid generic templates. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via Charged Poise.</comment>
