<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear of curse vs. fear of silence) drive every choice; calcification as earned renunciation with visceral cost in "skin turning ivory" while eyes conduct symphony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly; closure as Charged Poise where calcified statue's "palm cupped as if releasing a bird" crystallizes cost with her eyes "conducting the symphony" amid irreversible transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Diamond's crack and copper veins function as micro-setting, constraining climax ("kissed the flaw, swallowed it") and charging final image where "veins lit like filaments" project texture-sounds onto walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: curse "seeping" not raging forces trade-off where decelerated heartbeat releases clearer phonemes, narrowing options to calcification as the only path to language revival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sand-dune consonants" and "clay-vowel pauses" in final line—a non-literal answer to language preservation that reweights texture-as-grammar without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature centers tactile/auditory senses ("taste the lost language’s grammar of textures"); rhythmic control peaks in "corduroy riverbed, knapped-flint sorrow" as stress compresses diction without voice fracture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere ("bone towers answered with a minor seventh that rattled her copper veins like loose wires") with crystalline propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic anthropology and mythic sacrifice; "copper-veined" conceit transforms familiar tropes through specific tactile translation mechanics that heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
