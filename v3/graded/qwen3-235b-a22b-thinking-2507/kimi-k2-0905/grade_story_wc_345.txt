<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; Mara’s altruism feels consistent without visible struggle. Kai’s shift from loneliness to leadership occurs off-page, weakening earned change. Strengths include embodied "altruistic pulse" and labor proving trust, but closure lacks layered values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Earned Stasis: Mara’s tether loosens as altruism lives in colonists, with conceptual cost (her fading) made undeniable by "violet on tongues." Orientation anchors by word 5 ("ghost of Mara drifted between twin suns"). Minor deduction: "doubt crawled in" paragraph slightly tells rather than dramatizes stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard planet constrains every choice: floating arches tilt to create stakes, anti-grav seeds force harvest, and Mara’s frost messages rely on dew. Final image charges setting as Mara "became the violet itself," with micro-setting (watering bell’s bronze rim) altering tactics through rhythm. No white-room syndrome; sensory detail mirrors urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save orchards before eclipse) tightens meaningfully: "seed-fruit must ride together" terrifies/thrills, forcing collective chains. Agency is Mara’s frost guidance driving tactics, with visible cost (arches sighing as they right themselves). Minor flaw: Kai’s coffee moment slightly eases tension without earned friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "family is the crop" chalked message avoids moralizing, while "brambled hope" evolves from "berries caught in wire" to "pure" bell tone. Final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost (Mara as reservoir), resisting tidy morals. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers in "survival is a collective verb."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "condensation swirling where ankles should be," "clang like berries caught in wire." Rhythmic control under pressure with "Share breath, share weight, share sky." Minor flaw: "altruistic spirit" borders on label, but no head-hopping and POV remains stable through collective action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "brambled hope" metaphor sustains throughout with concrete texture ("frosted whisper"). Propulsion via strong verbs: "arches sighed, righted themselves." Minor deduction: "altruistic pulse" slightly tells, but no figurative muddle near closure. Final line’s "slow ripening into shared life" charges stakes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope through specific mechanics (frost messages, nebula respite) and "brambled hope" emotional texture. Risk-taking: multi-POV via collective action without head-hopping. Freshness in "human ropes swaying above cloud," but premise (community harvest) lacks non-obvious moral calculus for 9.0+.</comment>
