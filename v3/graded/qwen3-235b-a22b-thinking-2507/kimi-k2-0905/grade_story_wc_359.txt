<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete (breath crystallizing into chords, tasting fear), with contradictory impulses (wonder vs. utility) culminating in the earned swallowing of the sheet—a visceral renunciation of passive preservation for embodied witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elian climbing toward light with bells quiet but eyes blazing crystallizes the cost of internalizing wonder, under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density shifts reweight stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as micro-setting constraining choices (aurora stripping scales, frozen eelgrass strings) and charges the final image—walls "clear as conscience" mirroring Elian’s transformed state after swallowing the sheet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elian’s agency: the test to "value wonder over utility" narrows options to swallowing the sheet, with unmistakable cost—his pulse retuned, aurora released—foreclosing bureaucratic certification for lived proof.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (swallowing sheet as certification) not moralizing; final image reweights "hush" as active space for song, offering non-literal answer to wonder’s necessity without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic "violet ripples," "tasting childhood fear") with rhythmic control under pressure; cadence shifts ("oscillating repose") taught early and paid off in the final climb’s crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("breath crystallized into brief golden chords") with propulsion that never muddles closure, and "fossilized sunrise" refracts meaning without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synthesis of wonder/utility trope through synesthetic specificity (prism-song, amber sheet) feels inevitable; swallowing the sheet as certification is a non-obvious turn that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
