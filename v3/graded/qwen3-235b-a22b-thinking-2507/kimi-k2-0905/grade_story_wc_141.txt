<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("gloomy cheerfulness") and embodied emotion ("taste of mildew and star-dust") drive micro-choices; flaw: myth-buster motivation leans intellectual over visceral, slightly undercooking emotional stakes despite strong micro-choices like retelling voices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: walls turn transparent revealing cultures holding the three sounds, reweighting the riddle's meaning with conceptual cost ("why listeners insisted on difference"); lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density escalation to the resonant hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (half-finished cello) constrains choices and charges closure: its growth feeds on voices, culminating in "strings aligning like meridians"; tool-as-setting elevates to 9-band by directly shaping the final image and Arlen's heartbeat-driven completion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the riddle) tightens through cello notes that narrow options, with visceral cost in the cracked seashell and dissolved compass; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens falters slightly in the telescope's unexplained movement, muddying pressure coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally from the final hum "tasting of tide and turning pages," reweighting the riddle without moralizing; avoids anti-patterns by making the insight ("why listeners insisted on difference") resonate through concrete action, not abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("boots crunching on glass that once measured starlight"), but register drift occurs when "ephemeral compass" introduces clinical diction mid-crisis; rhythmic control under pressure is otherwise masterful, with elision (memories) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density ("gloomy cheerfulness clung to him like salt spray") propel momentum; minor flaw: "had sworn he had forgotten" exhibits paraphrase redundancy, but closure image ("resonant hum that tasted of tide and turning pages") remains crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of myth-busting and acoustic resonance feels inevitable; risk-taking (cello as memory conduit) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "ephemeral compass" borders on over-familiar magical object tropes despite strong contextual integration.</comment>
