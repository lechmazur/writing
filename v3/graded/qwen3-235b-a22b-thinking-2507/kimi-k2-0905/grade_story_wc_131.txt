<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's embodied emotion ("elbows worn smooth") and contradictory impulses (hiding fragments yet craving connection) earn his final visibility. Girl's characterization remains thin despite pivotal role, lacking specific worldview beyond memorized words.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "I see you" crystallizes the cost of invisibility with palpable emotional weight. Orientation anchors firmly within 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through fragment density buildup to the palm-on-floorboards moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library setting actively constrains choices—steam pipes dictate movement, candlelight creates "sapphire hush" pressure. The copper pipe caching site evolves from physical detail to closure-charging object when Lorca's voice emerges beneath the girl's ear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through fragment density (lullaby → Lorca → Elias's own voice), narrowing options until visibility becomes inevitable. City lights' flicker creates atmospheric urgency but doesn't actively tighten decisions like the pipe chase mechanics do.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges through action: "caching" as literal/figurative memory preservation avoids moralizing. Final image of girl reading with hand on boards offers resonant answer to "how stories guide"—no abstract statements, only embodied continuation of the chorus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("oxide surface flaking like dried blood") and rhythmic control shifting from staccato fragments to lyrical flow during voice sequences. Zero head-hopping despite dual perspective; psychic distance modulates flawlessly with the candle's pulse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "moth wings" simile for lullaby demonstrates precise textural density. Only hairline slip: "sense memory flooded him" risks cliché but is redeemed by immediate concrete sensory follow-up (lavender water, needle scratch).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tape fragment trope through methodical caching mechanics and sensory specificity. Emotional truth in "I see you" transcends premise—Elias's visibility earned through action, not magical realism. Risk of sentimental "heartbeat" line avoided by concrete final image.</comment>
