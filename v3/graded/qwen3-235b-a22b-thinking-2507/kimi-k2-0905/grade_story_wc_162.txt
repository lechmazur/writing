<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; "featherly determined" remains abstract despite strong motivation. Final choice earns cost through prior causality but interior conflict lacks simultaneous tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "stepped off... into air that felt thick with memory" crystallizes the threshold concept with palpable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drifting terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (westward drift forces action) and charges the final image. Wood grain analysis elevates environment beyond description into tactical necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Juniper’s realization about thresholds, narrowing options to a single leap. Cost is legible in "falling not down but through," though escalation under Accumulative lens could deepen visceral urgency slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "necessary distances" transforms from weather code to existential truth. Final line ("necessary distance she’d been traveling toward") reweights the journey without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in wood-grain reading, but "learned to read necessary distances in the way wood remembered storms" slightly over-explains. Rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "moth wings" simile integrates flawlessly. Minor anthropomorphism ("wood remembered storms") risks figurative muddle but is redeemed by narrative context. Final image propulsion is immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "lost child" trope through weather-code mazes and prism terrace. Risk-taking (time-bending thresholds) heightens stakes, though "butterfly effect" terminology slightly echoes familiar physics concepts.</comment>
