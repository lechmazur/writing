<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority leans poetic over concrete; "blood-watered seed" dream lacks embodied contradiction. Micro-choices like kneeling on fractured skull show strong pressure response, but caretaker boy’s motivation remains opaque despite pivotal role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: bell tower ringing "without a tongue" crystallizes faith’s return with undeniable cost in "spaces her exile had hollowed." Accumulative lens holds through mirrored reflections to root-knitting climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard functions as essential micro-setting; roots knitting femurs to fig trunks directly constrain choices (aligning sundial on vertebrae). Slight sensory imbalance—over-reliance on visual vs. tactile decay under stress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (rebuilding faith) tightens meaningfully when mirrors fracture her reflection into ancestors, forcing stance crystallization. Agency clear in planting rib-gnomon, but "rob or rebuild" question lacks early escalation traction until climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: fractured mirrors and blood-watered seed avoid moralizing. Final image ("shadow to follow") resonantly answers "interrupted journeys" without stating moral, achieving non-literal closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes the color of oxidized copper") shines, but cadence stutters in high-pressure beats: "Each noon she aligned..." creates subtle template rhythm. No head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "fossilized petals" and "myrrh-scented air" do triple duty. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" phrasing during climax, but earns thematic weight. Zero loops or scaffold in closure unit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora tropes through catacomb orchard’s bone-root symbiosis; "roots knitting femurs to fig trunks" is fresh inflection. Emotional specificity avoids safety middle, though faith-restoration arc echoes familiar spiritual rebirth.</comment>
