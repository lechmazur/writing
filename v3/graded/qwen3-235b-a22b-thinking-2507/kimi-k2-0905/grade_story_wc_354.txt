<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("cruel" teacher teaching beauty in difficulty) is concrete and drives the final choice, but exile motivation lacks visceral embodiment; no secondary character to test relationships under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (exile as transposition), but backstory about the covenant arrives too late to anchor causality early; twilight-to-night progression saves orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus actively constrains perception ("boundaries blur between thirty-two pieces and infinite variables"), while the worry stone's evolving dent charges the final image as a "perfect fit" for action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through electromagnetic pattern recognition narrowing options, but political consequences of the "eclipsed covenant" remain abstract; cost is felt but not viscerally dramatized in the present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Beauty in difficulty" emerges through concrete particulars (stone dent, twilight geometries), with the final image ("darkness lit by certainty") offering non-literal thematic resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—chess lexicon ("algebraic notation," "crystalline beauty") shapes every observation; rhythmic control mirrors strategic calculation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "hopeful melancholy" repetition and slight overwriting in cosmic descriptions prevent 9.0+; closure image remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms chess allegory into cosmic resonance through specific execution (correlating silence as notation), though "exiled tutor" trope lacks sufficient subversion for 9.0+.</comment>
