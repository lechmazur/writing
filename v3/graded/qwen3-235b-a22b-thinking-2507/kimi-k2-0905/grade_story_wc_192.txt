<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but motivation under-dramatized; "burned bridges" backstory told not shown in choices, missing contradictory impulses during ritual climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but "cost proof test" fails—final suffocation practice lacks legible consequence despite strong Accumulative escalation through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sanctuary actively constrains ritual in scorched circle; starlight-as-tears motif charges final image with micro-setting precision under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early but escalation lacks protagonist agency; ritual feels rote rather than narrowing options under Accumulative lens, weakening cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dissolution metaphor, but "not an ending but a beginning" borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frozen tears," "loaded emptiness") with rhythmic control under pressure, though Q2<9.0 caps eligibility per global gate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops with high density; "burned bridges" cliché redeemed by contextual specificity, but minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of suffocation/breath metaphor through ritual specificity, but charcoal sanctuary echoes familiar post-apocalyptic tropes without full transformation.</comment>
