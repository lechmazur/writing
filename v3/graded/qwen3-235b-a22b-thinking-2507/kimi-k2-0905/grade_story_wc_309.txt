<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (guild compliance vs wonder-seeking) drives the keystone choice with embodied cost: "voice cracking like thin ice" as he confesses his quest. Final renunciation of credentials feels earned through prior micro-choices like stepping onto unstable mist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: Elian stranded yet free on snow island, with "unmeasured joy" crystallizing the cost. Orientation anchors spire/garden by line 5; "darkness felt exactly bright enough" reweights stakes with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The keystone constrains every choice—Elian’s decision to dim it directly alters tactics and charges the final image. "Unbarcoded snowflakes" transform from setting detail to thematic payload, with sensory specificity ("printer toner," "lilacs") woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through Elian’s agency: his "partial solution" forecloses both guild reintegration and passive preservation. The cost—stranded but drone-invisible—is unmistakable in "legs dangling into night," reconfiguring the automation stake under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: paper boats and unbarcoded snow reprise the "sacred in the simple" motif without moralizing. Final snowflakes as "impossible prayers" offer resonant, non-literal answer to quantification, charged by prior image accumulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lumens per citizen," "algorithmic auroras") filters all observation. Under pressure, syntax tightens ("Each footfall sank inches...") while maintaining rhythmic control; no head-hopping in single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "snowflakes unbarcoded now" crystallizes closure with high density. Minor register drift in "sacred in the simple" (slightly abstract) but quickly grounded by paper boat action. Propulsion flawless through sensory verbs ("exhaling," "dissolved").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" synthesizes automation critique into fresh emotional truth. Specific details (copper badge melting, printer-toner light) avoid dystopian clichés; risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
