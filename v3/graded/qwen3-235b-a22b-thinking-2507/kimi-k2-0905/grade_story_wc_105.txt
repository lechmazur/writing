<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Mara realizes her complicity in betrayal; embodied emotion peaks as she staggers against bark hearing "glass cracking under weight of snow." Micro-choices like preserving the "echoless gap" reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "admitting the hollow space inside every future connection" reconfigures trust's fragility while dawn seeps ultraviolet into waves. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward the obsidian shard's hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken lifeboats-as-planters constrain choice by feeding roots on "memory leached from salt-soaked wood," charging the final image where trees "hold both wound and blossom." Aurora's shifting colors mirror emotional states through tactile action like "boots grinding salt-caked slate."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara's agency: feeding the forge her preserved absence narrows options to pressing her ear against iron, making the subsonic betrayal frequency tangible. Cost crystallizes when trees taste "this fresher wound" of her complicity, altering her future design philosophy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the obsidian shard's "battered marvel of a note" – trust's fragility reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image of brother's laugh "teaching trees how to hold both wound and blossom" offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question of absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "tasting iron in the air" and hearing auroras as "lavender light" reflect Mara's designer lens. Rhythmic control under pressure shown when forge "exhaled a sound like glass cracking," compressing diction without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops but one density risk: "While cambium split and cells divide" slightly echoes earlier phrasing. Otherwise, propulsion thrives in lines like "pocketed the obsidian shard, its surface still warm, still humming," where concrete action charges atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of hearing technology and emotional archaeology feels inevitable: "collecting absences" transforms a trope into visceral stakes. Risk-taking heightens coherence as the forge's "bruised note" redefines trust's physics without gimmickry.</comment>
