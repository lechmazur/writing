<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wonder through micro-choices (recalibrating turnstile, pocketing matchbox) is concrete and flawlessly integrated; her truthful constraint creates authentic tension in the lie climax. Only slight weakness: boy's role lacks secondary pressure despite catalyzing the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: coins orbiting then clattering back etched with bees, while "gate open" versus "dawn engineers" crystallizes professional risk. Orientation clear by 112 words; causal lens (lie → lightning strike) holds flawlessly to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower isn't backdrop but active constraint—elevators dark forcing stairs climb, copper cones enabling the lie's effect. Recurring matchbox charges closure (warm as bread, placed on turnstile), meeting the 9+ gate by constraining choices and reweighting the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is pure causal agency: riddle compels ascent, truthful nature forces the lie. Dominant stake (wonder preservation vs. job security) tightens meaningfully at the summit with visible cost—coins leaping then etched with bees, gate left open for engineers' return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (whispered lie reanimating wax), avoiding moralizing. Final matchbox offering—"wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest"—resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral, though thematic weight leans slightly on riddle text.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky bruise into nectar dusk," "brass heart beat") with rhythmic control under pressure; diction stays within Mara's lexicon ("fragile varnish over wonder"). No head-hopping; single-POV distance remains consistent even during lightning strike.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances story ("wax wings melted into golden puddles" embodies loss while setting up reanimation). Figurative language sparse but purposeful—final line's "coins... newly etched with bee silhouettes" crystallizes theme without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific, grounded choices: truthful toll keeper forced to lie for wonder, drone hive failure enabling human curiosity's triumph. Risk-taking in quiet climax (no battle, just whispered lie) heightens stakes coherently; "nectar dusk" hue reprise in melted wax charges closure.</comment>
