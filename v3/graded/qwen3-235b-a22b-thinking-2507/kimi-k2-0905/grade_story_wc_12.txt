<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via ultraviolet palette trade and "starved it with ambiguity," but congregants lack micro-choices beyond thematic vessels; priest’s final loop step earns endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: priest becomes "living axle" while demon shrinks into Möbius strip, with cost legible in "body slackened" and "statue ears could see" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s "fold in space" actively constrains choices (e.g., echoes trapping sound), charging closure as "unraveled stillness rotated" becomes the priest’s embodied final state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates via sonic density ("chords of contradiction") under Accumulative lens, narrowing options as loops "overlap" with cost in demon’s dissolution and priest’s transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is acoustic-centric ("rosary of clicks," "muffled clarity"); rhythm mirrors loop mechanics with purposeful fragments, zero head-hopping despite congregant vignettes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line propulsion excels ("footstep became a rosary of clicks"), but "knot loosened in the net" risks mixed metaphor; no loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms exorcism via sound physics; "muffled clarity" as spiritual state avoids cliché, with risk-taking (sonic theology) heightening stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
