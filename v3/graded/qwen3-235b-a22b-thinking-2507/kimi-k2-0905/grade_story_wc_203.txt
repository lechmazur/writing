<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s elevator-as-fall metaphor and the looped self-confrontation, but ghost-child’s silence limits relationship crucible development; micro-choices (leaving barrel) earn closure with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara’s decision to ascend crystallizes with conceptual cost ("weightless, burdened, alive"), reweighting the elevator-as-fall premise through the ticket stub’s transformation; Accumulative lens holds relentlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dust patterns and mainspring barrel function as micro-setting, constraining choices (navigation, loop discovery) and charging the final image; abandoned circus details feel tactile and pressure-driven, never ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency (climbing, leaving barrel), with the loop revelation forcing a trade-off between artifact and self-preservation; cost is visceral in the "crack in herself" realization, though ghost pressure lacks escalation depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: elevator cables as deferred falls, ticket stubs as ascent invitations; final image ("admit one to the sky") reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing ambiguity in repair vs. surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate ("analyzing dust like Braille," "eyes like blown fuses"); rhythmic control under pressure (sentence fragments during climbing) avoids elision pitfalls; single-POV consistency elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with exceptional density, but "weightless burden" recurs with diminishing returns in the climax; figurative language ("snowfall of ticket stubs") charges momentum without muddle, though one scaffold phrase dilutes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms ghost-story tropes through elevator mechanics and time cracks; the mainspring barrel’s reprise as "heart without a body" synthesizes premise with emotional truth, avoiding abstraction while risking structural boldness.</comment>
