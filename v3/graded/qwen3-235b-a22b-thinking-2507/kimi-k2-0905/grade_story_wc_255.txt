<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied contradiction: Milo’s trembling hands seeking color he cannot see, yet realizing beauty is "the violence of it." Final choice to smash glass is earned by his "fractured" vision epiphany, with cost legible in the dimmed marble eye. No diagnostic label-speak; flaws (obsession with perfection) drive the irreversible trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the spiral garden’s "we are most alive where we are broken" crystallizes stance with felt cost (smashed glass, returned marble eye). Orientation anchored by 80 words ("glassblower’s courtyard tiles," "colorblind painter Milo"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via pattern density (plant codes, fractured hues)—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "burnt soil" and "dying plants" directly supply the spiral’s materials, while "glass-blown leaves" constrain Milo’s arrangements. Final image’s "colored rain" reweights the phoenix ash through atmospheric cause. Sensory hierarchy stays character-particular (Milo’s tactile search, Rosa’s steam-fogged goggles).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Accumulative escalation: Milo’s initial search (day 1) → plant-pattern dialogue (days 2–3) → shattered-color vision (day 4). Cost is unmistakable: "hues screaming against the next like discordant notes" and the "starlight dimmed" marble eye. Agency drives the climax—Milo guides Rosa’s hands to blow glass—fulfilling the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: the spiral garden’s "notes of imperfection" reweights "bartered awakenings" without moralizing. Final image—"vines learning to play the notes of imperfection"—offers a resonant answer to Milo’s quest, rejecting tidy binaries by embracing "terrible beauty." No thematic echo; cost is woven into the marble eye’s dimming.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV’s perceptual signature is flawless: color descriptions filter through blindness ("copper and teal where heat had scarred him"), while compression under stress ("he pressed the marble eye to his socket") heightens pressure. Voice modulates from lyrical (phoenix rising) to staccato (plant codes), with no head-hopping. Elision ("bartered awakenings" custom) is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero line-level artifacts; propulsion through multi-jobbing lines: "warped by heat into a delicate silver curl that sang" establishes object, transformation, and sound. Final image’s "hollow center" recharges the reed motif without redundancy. No figurative muddle in peak beats—clarity and density peak at "beauty was imperfect, fractured, each hue screaming like discordant notes."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing tropes through specific lived detail: "bartered awakenings" transforms artifact exchange via "failures that still held music," while "glass-blown leaves cooled into permanent autumn" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—Milo’s color epiphany reweights prior patterns—without sacrificing coherence. Emotional truth in embracing brokenness, not redemption.</comment>
