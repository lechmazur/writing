<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation via traded memories but "perceptively calm" lacks embodied contradiction under stress; pulse bucking shows one layer of emotion but no simultaneous conflicting impulses during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: gifting the heartbeat creates undeniable conceptual cost ("without compass or currency") while the final terrace vision reconfigures meaning; orientation is immediate and lens (Accumulative) holds cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism parapet actively constrains choices (rain-slick surface, spectrum creation) and charges the final image ("polishing the prism parapet"); sensory details like "cadmium hope" pigments emerge organically from pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the third mirror’s ultimatum ("surrender the heartbeat entirely"), with agency-driven escalation via her singing; cost is visceral in "risk the mirror lying" and the irreversible loss of her compass.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme resolves through the final image of citizens receiving "personal spectrum of possible selves," a resonant non-literal answer to "showing possibilities" without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via concrete vision rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised violets," "cadmium hope") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor drift in "perceptively calm" phrasing slightly violates POV modesty during high-stakes decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "song sharp enough to cut glass into grace" crystallizes theme with concrete specificity; only hairline flaw is "perceptively calm" as telling rather than showing in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "mirage painter" and heartbeat bargaining transforms mirror trope through ethical stakes; emotional truth in trading maternal memories avoids derivative safety while "cracked mirror" demand feels inevitable.</comment>
