<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("screaming tenderness") embodied through micro-choices like beacon adjustment to heartbeat rhythm, but "diagnostic label-speak" in "screaming tenderness" undermines embodied emotion under peak pressure, costing 0.3.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("vibrating with the frequency of everything she couldn't say"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant) nearly breaches high-band gate; orientation anchor in opening line saves Q3 cap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glass, salt air, and night flowers function as micro-setting constraining choices (cork placement/scattering intentions); scent progression charges final image where "vibrating cork" embodies constrained choice and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (heat wave breaking → scent release → beacon adjustment), but pressure escalation lacks visible price paid during the single tightening; cost feels retrospective rather than altering mid-scene tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "vibrations of intent" motif reweighted at closure (cork prism scattering mother's name), avoiding moralizing; final image answers "whispers vs shouts" with resonant action, though "screaming tenderness" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dawn bleeding like a wound," scent as language) with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure, though "screaming tenderness" risks register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "screaming tenderness" phrasing creates mixed metaphor (auditory/visual) that muddles physical logic during critical beacon adjustment, dulling closure's immediacy by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse mechanics and vibrational physics feels inevitable; risk-taking (beacon pulse as heartbeat) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "screaming tenderness" slightly echoes existing poetic tropes.</comment>
