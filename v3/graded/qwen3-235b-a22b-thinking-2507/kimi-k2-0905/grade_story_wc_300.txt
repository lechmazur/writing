<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in fear of unspoken living rooms drives confession scene; embodied emotion in throat aching with collective weight. Minor slip: internal conflict lacks visible contradictory impulses during pivotal crown acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: Mara's transformation into perpetual witness legible in "Mara walks forever through crystal veins." Orientation clear by paragraph one; Accumulative lens held flawlessly through mineral memory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as micro-setting constraining choice: confessions etched in seashell spiral force Mara's confession, while quartz mirror enables the climax. Mineral tears fracturing light charges final image of "crown of living light" imprint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation through density increase (confessions multiplying, silhouettes coalescing) under Accumulative lens; cost crystallized when crown "biting gently" grounds her before grief evaporates. Dominant stake (dissolving walls between hearts) tightened by her confession's physical toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: abandoned confessions calcified into stone become "filament of light" stitching silhouettes. Final image of orphans carrying seashells offers resonant non-literal answer to loneliness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in mineral-focused noticing ("mineral tears," "calcite answered"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with fractured syntax matching cave echoes. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from observational to transcendent seamlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; "pearl flared, insisting" compresses agency into two words. Figurative language ("stalactites hung like frozen chords") serves pressure without muddle. Final line achieves "resonant, non-literal answer" through "face it forgot it possessed."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transformation of bunker trope: shelters for pre-bomb loneliness, not apocalypse. Emotional specificity in "I wanted to be a violin" avoids generic despair. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making universal ache feel newly excavated.</comment>
