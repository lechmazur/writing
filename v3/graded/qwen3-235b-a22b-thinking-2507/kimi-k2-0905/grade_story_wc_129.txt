<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in reed-sculpting craft; "boldly sympathetic" flaw drives search but contradiction lacks simultaneous tension in peak beat (doubt vs drive). Final choice earned via glyph-touch cost, yet micro-choices under pressure could deepen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density escalates to Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when glyph appears. Cost crystallizes in "buckled knees" and shifted orchard tone. Orientation clear by 100 words; closure reweights kinship with felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard constrains every choice (sniffing metallic tang, moonstone paths) and charges closure via "cracks of warm light" reconfiguring seekers. Obsidian arbor's glyph mechanic is micro-setting essential to final image. Sensory hierarchy filtered through Lira's marsh-reed bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (inherited vs forged kinship) tightens through shared search; cost legible in physical collapse when lattice appears. Agency-driven escalation via tag pursuit, but "boldly sympathetic" trait's tradeoff needs sharper mid-beat friction (e.g., hesitation at arbor).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "heron cradling reed" glyph reprise: kinship as active forging, not passive inheritance. Final image ("signpost," "webs spread like dew") resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; complexity in "solitude ends when looking side-to-side" lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "calloused fingers smelling of peat," "luminescent ache." Rhythm modulates from lyrical to staccato during discovery. Zero head-hopping; "we" twins' dialogue distinct via braided sentences. Elevated diction stays within Lira's sculptor lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop: "murmur of lost languages" repeated verbatim (para 1 & 11). Otherwise, high density ("quivering mercury rippled outward") with propulsion. No figurative muddle; final line's "shimmered on" avoids overwriting. Loop prevents 9+ but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesis of "webs of kinship" as active forging (not metaphor) feels inevitable. Risk-taking: accumulative structure without causal turns lands closure via Charged Poise. Freshness in obsidian arbor's glyph ritual transforming "solitude" into procession. Avoids derivative belonging tropes.</comment>
