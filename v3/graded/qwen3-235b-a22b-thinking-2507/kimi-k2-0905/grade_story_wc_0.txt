<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (grief vs scientific detachment) manifests in concrete micro-choices like handling the wing fragment, but "kindled humility" risks thematic echo; brother's flood death lacks causal pressure in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (Mara ceasing to outrun storms), though lens ambiguity lingers until midpoint; flood timeline vagueness slightly dilutes temporal stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as active micro-setting—failing lights force headlamp work, rain-soaked gloves prove environmental pressure directly shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via accumulating storm threats and data patterns narrows options toward crystallized stance; cost legible when rain "sluiced across gloves" yet she persists, reweighting her relationship to grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust-pattern accumulation, not declaration; final line "drama is optional; change is not" reweights prior material as earned resonance without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo penalties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (neutron-star lexicon fused with botanical observation) maintains consistency under pressure; minor register drift in "galvanized steel" slightly jars scientific POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "kindled humility" repetition is a hairline scaffold slip, but "cobalt fire" maintains clarity without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic/biological time scales through dust-layer algorithm; emotional specificity in grief-stricken scientist avoids safety middle, though flood trauma archetype slightly familiar.</comment>
