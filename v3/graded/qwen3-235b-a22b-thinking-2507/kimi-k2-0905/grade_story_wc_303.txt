<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("mulberry ache") and embodied choice under pressure; micro-choice with bow earns closure, though custodian lacks sufficient pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("orchards blooming out of season"); accumulative lens holds through refracted moonlight to final image without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice violin constrains choice (heat/melting) and charges closure ("puddle reflecting tired eyes"); velvet dome cracking reweights setting's symbolic weight with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through violin's physical state (melting) and cereus pressure; cost crystallizes in empire's unraveling, driven by Lira's agency with no coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("green gossip," "fractured continent") with rhythmic control; no head-hopping despite lyrical compression, though custodian's inkblot pupils verge on ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats; "propagate" refrain and coffee-stain imagery avoid metaphor muddle. Minor density risk in "promise still cooling" but payoff justifies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of provenance research and ice-violin cosmology; emotional truth in "perforated destinies" avoids abstraction while transforming conquest tropes through botanical telepathy.</comment>
