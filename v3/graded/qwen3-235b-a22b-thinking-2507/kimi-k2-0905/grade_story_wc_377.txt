<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (silence vs. vibration communication) drives every choice; embodied emotion in "fingertips reading micro-oscillations" avoids label-speak. Lacks secondary pressure since only one character acts on-page, limiting relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: empty pockets and boy receiving wedge crystallize cost of transmitting wonder. Accumulative lens holds through comet-triggered pattern break, with iceberg's evaporation making conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Bluff constrains every choice: altitude thins air (affecting breath), wind cools bearings, cloudless sky enables comet viewing. "Sweating cold diamonds" refracting comet light charges the final image with tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stake (preserving wonder's "color") tightens via comet deadline, narrowing options to final calibration. Cost is visible in shrunken iceberg and emptied pockets, with pressure growing through density of sensory detail under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Wonder as frequency" emerges through concrete actions (tuning wedges, light-refraction), never stated outright. Final image of boy with wedge reweights opening by showing transmission without moralizing, making theme inseparable from sculpture mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("fingertips reading micro-oscillations like breath-scriptures") is character-specific and consistent. Rhythmic control peaks during comet sequence with purposeful fragments ("spin here, hiss there") heightening pressure without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or redundancies; "driplets glistened like newborn stars" shows textural specificity. Minor flaw: "kinetic monument" slightly explanatory amid otherwise vivid showing, but no muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "artist monument" trope through concrete physics (electromagnetic comet interaction). "Color of wonder" as literal light refraction avoids abstraction, with risk-taking (silence as resonant cavity) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
