<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's "warmly methodical" trait manifests concretely in cataloging "rumors librarians called coincidences" and the final catalog entry; her braiding action embodies contradictory impulses (preserving vs. translating absence) with visible cost in wax bleeding into hemp fibers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as time "folds" the village "between ticks" with undeniable conceptual cost—the hollowed chronology now carries embodied memory; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from the rust-tasting air to the rope's transformation without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The clock tower's "gears taller than confessionals" actively constrain choices by supplying the ceremonial rope; the wax-seal/rope fusion charges the final image as "warm as fresh bread," directly enabling the thematic resolution through micro-setting mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (translating absence) escalates through Elara's braiding actions under accumulative lens; cost is visceral as "oxidized time" flakes fall and wax bleeds into cord, narrowing options to a single reconfiguration that alters time's fabric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions (braiding the village into rope) not abstraction; the final image of graduates feeling "oddly full" resonates as a non-literal answer to "fables of absence" without moralizing, reweighting the erased village as lived emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "air tasted of rust and rain" and "hemp until crest and cord merged"; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical description to urgent short phrases during braiding, with no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "flakes of oxidized time" and "hollow tooth in the jaw of chronology" demonstrate high-density imagery that propels momentum without muddle, even during the high-pressure braiding sequence where every verb serves triple duty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "erased history" trope through specific mechanics (braiding rope as translation, time folding between ticks); the swan-necked seal's transformation feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding safety-middle with bold structural choices that heighten emotional stakes.</comment>
