<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied through "knees scallop inward" physicalizing grief; micro-choices like hairpin-stabbing anchor causality. Final renunciation of escape (choosing descent) earns closure but "scallop" tic slightly flattens emotional specificity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "rebirth demands death" crystallizes stakes with boy's sacrifice; cost legible in "stepped backward into air." Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts, though late "valley exhaled" slightly softens final cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Umbral grotto and hairpin function as micro-setting constraining choices (stabbing cliff, fusion ritual); cloudwater basin directly charges closure by reflecting futures. "Grape-cooled air" and tannin smells anchor urgency but vineyard hush occasionally risks white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: forgiveness → hairpin-stabbing → descent choice. Debt resolution remains conceptual (unpaid coins softening), lacking visceral on-page test; cost is undeniable in boy's dissolution but external stakes feel abstracted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through vineyard/debt metaphor reweighted by final image (coins to soil); avoids moralizing via "contentment's source was not a place but a direction." Near-miss: "cycle of rebirth" borders on thematic echo but redeemed by bioluminescent ivy's shifting names.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "lungs tasting thin, grape-cooled air"; syntax mirrors emotional compression ("she did not scream; she climbed"). Single flaw: "kindly decisive" description slightly intrudes as label rather than embodied trait in boy's introduction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters in "scallop" overuse (knees/edges/shell), creating synonym churn; "fermented forgiveness" sap risks purple prose. Final image ("lantern left on in a house") achieves crystalline density but "scallop" tic recurs in closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of debt/forgiveness through viticulture; "scallop-winged moths" transforms rebirth trope. Risks poetic abstraction but redeemed by tactile details (scalp-oil blackened hairpin). Slight derivative edge in "cycle" framework, though tannin-boy elevates it.</comment>
