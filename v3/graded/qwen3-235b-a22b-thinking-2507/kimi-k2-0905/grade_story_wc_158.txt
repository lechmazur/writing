<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in exhaustion as "hollowing blade" versus lullaby's pull, but "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drifts toward abstract conceptualization without sufficient embodied friction in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Zale sleeping while "bloom continues the watch" crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("centuries of longing stayed behind, photosynthesizing"), perfectly serving the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (spiral ascent, apex chamber) and charges the final image—bioluminescent throat singing lullaby reconfigures the cathedral's purpose with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation via the lullaby warping into "reef-shadow joy" and glow "growing shyly unstoppable" tightens pressure under accumulative lens; Zale peeling the postcard apart forecloses his path with visible cost (centuries of longing converted to petals).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—petals becoming "unaddressed prayers," cherry pits growing into future armistices—avoiding moralizing; the dawn image ("children would find cherry pits... growing armistices") delivers non-literal resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("off-key wind," "coral bruises") remains poet-specific under pressure; rhythmic control in "shyly unstoppable" repetitions teaches pattern early and pays off in closure's cadence without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-jobs ("limestone drank his voice, then gave it back multiplied" compresses causality, voice, and setting). Figurative language ("bioluminescent throat") maintains clarity even in peak lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis transforms war/peace tropes through botanical specificity (blossom armistice seeding cherry pits); risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, made inevitable by "reef-shadow joy" motif's earned evolution.</comment>
