<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract despite vivid action; "dreamless" contradiction isn't embodied in micro-choices during the ritual. Motivation ("cultivate sparks") is clear but lacks visceral friction beyond the final pulse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds impeccably: density peaks when pages turn and poppies braid into silhouettes. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost—midnight splitting reconfigures time’s cost through the clock’s motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dune sand and chess clock constrain every choice; the clock’s burial charges the final image. "Glassy sand" and "gears kissing the sand" exemplify tactile specificity that pressures the ritual’s execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the strongbox’s revelation—sparks must be cultivated before poppies dim. Cost is felt in the guard’s "coat lighter" after sacrifice, though the abstract "unspent future" slightly softens tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges from "divergent time" reweighting loss and hope; the final line ("what sings never truly ends") resonates without moralizing. Ash remembering "being leaves" crystallizes earned wisdom through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "defective film frames," "particles of ash still drifting." Voice modulates from sparse ("He did not flinch") to lyrical during the charm, with no head-hopping despite phantom children.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silver scars disappearing into starlight" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Rhythm accelerates during the chant ("Lina, Taro, Saa, Kiv"), then breathes in the closure’s "hush between heartbeats."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Divergent time" transforms archival tropes through the clock’s dual motion. Risk-taking (wave functions as ritual mechanics) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("phosphorescent poppies") avoids abstraction.</comment>
