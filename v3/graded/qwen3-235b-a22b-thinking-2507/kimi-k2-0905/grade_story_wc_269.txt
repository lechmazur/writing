<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's interiority avoids therapy-speak; "eel waking in her chest" embodies contradictory impulses (grief/curiosity). Final choice to descend earns role shift with visible cost: abandoning solitary witness for active remembering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mira's realization ("role was never to prove loss but to remember the way back") reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in final pillars sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea level station functions as micro-setting that charges closure: "drifting moored specter" evolves into "gate left ajar," constraining Mira's final tapping choice while mirroring thematic shift from sentinel to conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (memory vs erasure) tightens through Mira's agency: atlas discovery → hydrophone confirmation → descent. Cost crystallizes in her role redefinition, narrowing options from documentation to active remembrance under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image ("gate left ajar") offers non-literal answer to "why paths disappear" without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete action (inserting atlas page) and charged object (pillars sealing revelation), avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hydrophone in hand" and "limestone ridge shaved clean of life" filter setting through witness's expertise. Rhythmic control under pressure ("headlights cutting green tunnels") avoids syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "feathered by salt" and "flapping like a gull with broken wing" show textural specificity. Minor scaffold in transition ("Memory dragged her back...") slightly dulls propulsion before descent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" transforms climate fiction tropes through specific, grounded integration (tapping as both ritual and communication). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, resisting safety-middle abstraction.</comment>
