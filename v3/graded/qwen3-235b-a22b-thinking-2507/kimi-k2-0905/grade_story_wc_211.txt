<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Ambrose’s oath-archivist identity clashing with childhood trauma, embodied through micro-choices like tweezers handling wax. Final endurance (waiting to answer) earns cost via dissolved shaving and vanishing orchard. Slight flaw: childhood vision’s causal urgency lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in the immersion beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—Ambrose’s dissolution into "velvet disquiet" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Orientation airtight via "foghorn on Pier 39" anchoring. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as density builds to orchard’s vanishing. Vision transition slightly softens escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (wax shaving) constrains choices—dissolving it triggers vision, alters tactics. Final image charges quince ink/braille ledger with cost. Sensory specificity ("caramel curl of wax," "greasy rainbow") avoids cliché. Orchard’s sentient fruit elevates beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Ambrose’s agency: immersion choice triggers vision, forcing acceptance of grief’s migration. Cost legible as orchard transmutes into "velvet disquiet." Tightening forecloses archival safety with visible price. Slight under-escalation in childhood memory’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges via particulars: wax’s mutability mirrors oath fragility. Final image ("voice neither alive nor dead") answers central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—Hittite verb "to remain" charges closure with earned ambiguity. Quince ink’s braille transformation resonates subtextually.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("wax was once his ink") filters all detail through scribe’s psyche. Rhythmic control peaks in vision sequence ("cracked, then resolved"). No head-hopping; compression taught early via foghorn’s "moan." Slight overwriting in "velvet disquiet" redeemed by closure payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences multitask ("caramel curl of wax" = texture/plot/theme). Final line’s rhythm ("neither alive nor dead, only remaining") crystallizes cost. "Greasy rainbow" avoids purple prose via concrete specificity. One near-duplicate stem ("quinces rustled"/"fruit bore faces") barely avoids scaffold penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: accidental prophecy via phonograph friction transforms trope. Emotional truth in oath-archivist’s trauma avoids quirk. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes—orchard’s sentient fruit feels inevitable. Derivative safety avoided via "velvet disquiet" as tangible cost.</comment>
