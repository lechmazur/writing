<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied choices (cranking wrist, whispering promise) but "preserve wonder" motivation lacks sufficient friction; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values yet moral ambiguity feels slightly abstracted without deeper flaw exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "she guarded the still point where every story agrees to be unfinished" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens with undeniable conceptual cost—the librarian's dissolving identity and the creel's expanding ring embodying perpetual becoming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tidal atrium functions as essential micro-setting: saltwater's rise constrains movement (copper boots hissing), while the creel's bamboo fibers charging with memories directly shape the final image and thematic charge of migratory storytelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the moon's pull on contradictions, narrowing options via the filament net's lunar mechanics; cost is felt in the librarian's "hollow adjust[ing] around absence," though the "sailor who feared depth" resistance lacks concrete escalation beyond lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "I will routine you into stars, but never cage your orbit" reweights preservation as liberation without moralizing; the bleeding ink joining silver fish offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory's fragility through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon, three nights past full, tugged at both seawater and the edges of her own name") and rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping despite multi-POV potential, with syntax mirroring the librarian's mechanical biology ("gears ticking quietly").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density without muddle: "salt settled on brass like frost that had never heard of cold" layers texture and theme; minor overwriting risk in "wintersun serenity" is offset by strategic variation in sentence rhythm during the smelting sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing library/archive tropes with tidal mechanics—preserving stories via contradiction-smelting transforms clichés into visceral necessity; the bamboo creel as heart-vessel feels inevitable yet unprecedented, avoiding safety-hedging through precise mechanical biology.</comment>
