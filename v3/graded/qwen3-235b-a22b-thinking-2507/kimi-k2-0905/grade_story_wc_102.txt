<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "affection folded until it cut" and breath-sharing climax, but the man remains underdeveloped as symbolic prop rather than individual; his motivation lacks embodied cost beyond tremor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens ambiguity past midpoint (Accumulative/Textural not solidified until "storage is posture" realization) triggers -0.4 deduction; Charged Poise closure lands cleanly with "fracture knitting" cost, but late lens crystallization harms escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct actively constrains choice: wisteria scent alters breathing, camera obscura projects reality, foggy lucidity becomes "fruit flesh"; environment charges final image as "glowing lantern" without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stake ("unused love storage") tightens through protagonist agency (camera obscura use, breath-sharing), but the man's coincidental appearance risks undermining pressure coherence; cost is felt in shared breath yet lacks tangible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (breathing through jade, biting fruit), avoiding moralizing; final line's "transparent" breath offering "forgiveness" resonates non-literally without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("breathing changes reveal what eye edits out") with rhythmic control, but "hairline fracture" is bodily cliché in peak beat; voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "porous" for jade bead creates minor register drift in high-pressure beat (-0.3), but figurative language stays coherent and closure-untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Risk-taking (breathing as love conduit, foggy lucidity as fruit) transforms spiritual clichés; "pilgrim of sparks" synthesizes Buddhist/Western motifs through specific sensory logic, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
