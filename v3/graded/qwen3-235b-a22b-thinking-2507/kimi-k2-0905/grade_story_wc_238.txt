<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "rosin-clung" apology and clipped-trill metaphor; ghost's silent question ("Was any of it heard?") reveals flaw-driven motivation without over-articulation. Slight over-polish in "pizzicato whispers" edges toward stock phrasing but redeemed by embodied cost of orchard destruction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "first tree fell, sounding a low E" vibrates the empty bottle, crystallizing forgiveness's physical price. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density peaks when scent "waking every dormant score" forces stance crystallization amid chainsaw violence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Archive’s induced currents actively constrain choices (current guides hand to folder); final "low E" tree-fall recharges the bottle’s resonance. Orchards aren’t backdrop—they’re live stakes, with tractors "idling like predators" tightening tactics until chainsaws enforce brutal cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory escalation: from "iron filings" air to chainsaws’ "brutal 4/4 time," pressure narrows options to one micro-choice (drop release). Cost is visceral when the falling tree’s vibration rattles the bottle—conceptual price (lost orchard) charges the final image under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through objects: apology transformed from "press release" to "I was wrong," orchard destruction as "brutal 4/4 time." Final lilac blooming "out of season" offers non-literal answer to forgiveness—no moralizing, just resonant cost rooted in "imperfect miracle" of forgiven silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is fiercely musical ("dust motes like slow arpeggios," "microtonal lament"), but "fractured into thirty-two facets" slightly overwrites. Voice modulates perfectly under stress—apology’s "rosin" metaphor tightens syntax, while chainsaw climax uses brutal fragments ("Orchard engines roared. Chainsaws bit bark.").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "induced current" motif drives propulsion without redundancy. Near-miss with "grief is a violin without strings" (therapy-speak risk), but immediate dramatization ("drawing invisible bow") rescues it. Final "bowed to the vibration" crystallizes rhythm without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes gossip-column exorcist trope with musical physics into fresh emotional calculus: "imperfect miracles" aren’t abstract but tactile (bottle’s resonance, chainsaw’s 4/4). Orchards as sonic landscape transforms "cutting trees" into brutal time signature—specificity avoids generic afterlife tropes.</comment>
