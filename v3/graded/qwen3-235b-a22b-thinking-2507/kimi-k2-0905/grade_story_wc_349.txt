<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; vendor’s final choice is earned but emotions remain abstract labels (“quantifying absence”) without visceral texture. Boy’s micro-choice (cracked marble/sigh) reveals value hierarchy, yet flaw-driven struggle is muted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: vendor’s erasure births white space. Accumulative lens holds (density escalates via bottled absences), but bottle count constraint feels arbitrary, missing persistent tactical pressure needed for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass orchard actively constrains choices: shelves rearrange to “close the aisle,” sagging branches weigh narratives, and the final “shore of white space” charges closure. Every detail filters through vendor’s perceptual bias (“algorithm of absence”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via accumulation (“orchard grows heavier”), but escalation leans reactive (vendor responds to patrons) rather than protagonist-driven agency. Cost is legible in “floorplate dip” and self-erasure, yet pressure lacks a single decisive deepening beat under stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: “stories begin where memory ends” crystallizes through actions, not moralizing. Final image (“letters rearranged into first sentence”) resonates as non-literal answer to “where stories begin,” avoiding thematic echo while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature (“brass doors exhaled their first official breath”) and rhythmic control under pressure. Lexicon stays vendor-consistent, though “compiled from indexes” slightly drifts into academic diction during librarian’s collapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; lines like “ribbon of silver into her palm” fuse propulsion and texture. One borderline-purple phrase (“syllable of forgotten language”) is justified by accumulative lens, but density never obscures closure’s crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through concrete stakes: “bottled moonlight” quantifies absence as tradeable commodity. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens meaning—glass orchard as “seed crystal” feels inevitable, not gimmicky, with emotional specificity in trades.</comment>
