<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; the baby hair anchor is strong, yet her conflict remains meditative rather than tense. No visible flaw in the final choice, but the endurance lacks layered struggle beyond momentary doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the "pebble in a shoe" cost is legible and irreversible, reconfiguring the magic’s nature under the accumulative lens. Orientation is anchored by word 10, and the eclipse timing teaches the pattern early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sage Ridge’s micro-setting (Listening Stone, silver sage) constrains Elara’s ritual and charges the final image with the curl’s darkening. Sensory details are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve causally during totality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wonder vs screens) is signaled early but remains abstract; escalation lacks visceral dramatization of the children’s loss. Pressure tightens via the eclipse, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied in specific moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the curl’s transformation and "pebble" metaphor, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights wonder as persistent discomfort, but the abstract stakes slightly dilute thematic resonance with the children’s off-page experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara’s musical framing shapes all observation ("note was neither major nor minor"). Rhythmic control under pressure is flawless, with lyrical compression taught early and paid off in the eclipse climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise, but "cautious exuberance" risks elevated diction clashing with therapist POV. Minor scaffold in "birds rehearsed twilight trills, ants froze mid-trail" slightly stalls momentum without altering tactics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music therapy and eclipse ritual avoids tropes, with specificity in the curl’s function. Risk-taking heightens stakes, but the premise’s familiarity caps ingenuity despite strong execution.</comment>
