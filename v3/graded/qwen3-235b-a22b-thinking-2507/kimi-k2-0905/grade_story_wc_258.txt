<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority crystallizes through embodied acts (ink-stained fingers, barefoot grid-walking), but grandmother's backstory lacks concrete micro-choice impact on present stakes; closure's infinite regression feels earned though the "steadily curious" trait isn't tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the infinite regression of cartomancers reweights collapse as fractal inevitability with undeniable conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern accumulation to the sigil reveal, though the thunder-counting beat slightly over-clarifies pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The measuring tape functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (hooking to nail, retraction snap) and charges closure (vault-like echo), while rain-beaded skylight evolves from sensory detail to camera obscura projection—environment directly shapes the final image's collapse mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency as she multiplies paths, culminating in the sigil discovery that reweights leveraged debt as inescapable pattern. Cost is conceptual (infinite regress of collapse) but the thunder-adjustment beat slightly softens escalation's visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the foil-flecked footprints become "ghost protocol" for collective memory, avoiding moralizing while the final image ("footprints alone could serve as currency") reweights hope as fragile, measurable silence without stating the thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("metal tongue," "card-back foil"), with rhythmic control during grid-walking that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping; every image filters through the cartomancer's embodied focus on measurement as meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("droplet that struck the glass sounded like a coin falling into an empty wallet") but slight synonym loops in rain descriptions ("rain-dripped past"/"rain softened") and one elevated phrase ("steadily curious hunger") risk register drift without pattern payoff in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms familiar tropes (tarot, post-crash anxiety) through specific synthesis: cryptocurrency volatility mapped to The Tower, measuring tape as secular relic. Risk-taking (geometry as prophecy) heightens stakes while closure's infinite regression feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
