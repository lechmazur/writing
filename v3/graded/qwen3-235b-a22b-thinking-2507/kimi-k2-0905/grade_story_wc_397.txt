<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's shift from euthanasia tourist to active listener is rooted in embodied contradiction—the "fold in patience" manifests through micro-choices like refusing to record final words while seeking the "sound of approaching endings." The shared fracture of the parasol chip creates organic kinship with the boy, culminating in her giving away the heirloom with visible cost. Slight underdevelopment of initial motivation friction prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the marina's "low grinding hymn" reconfigures endings as "a sigh that keeps going" with conceptual cost (the mercy ship's hesitation). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure builds through density ("chime thinner than moonlight") and pattern breaks (the horn's meaning shifts via recognition). Orientation is anchored by line 1 with no debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina actively constrains choices: ice "groaned under their weight," Mara skids on "plates of sea," and the parasol tip "quivered" in ice. Micro-setting (ivory point piercing wind) charges closure as "tuning fork for silence." Every sensory detail serves pressure—e.g., the chime "tasted of salt and lullabies" embodies the thematic hinge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early: "simply watching feel obscene" vs. "grief... cleaner teacher." Pressure deepens under accumulative lens as the boy's trauma intensifies Mara's shift toward creating "windborne solace." The tap of the parasol narrows options decisively, with cost legible in her lifelong change ("never returned to the mercy ship"). Agency-driven deepening elevates beyond static conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: Mara's final "portable roofs against endings" reweights the premise without moralizing. The ending's "sigh that keeps going" offers a resonant answer to "learning the sound of approaching endings," charged by the marina's singing ice. No thematic echo—wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the parasol's chime.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "lace parasol tip balanced against her collarbone like a question mark" and "grief... cleaner teacher" reflect Mara's poetic interiority. Rhythmic control shines under pressure—"Boots skidding across plates of sea that groaned"—with no head-hopping. Slight exposition in "sanctioned endings" prevents 9.7+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: "chime thinner than moonlight" multiplies meaning without muddle, and "sigh that keeps going" crystallizes closure. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly ("a long note that folded the air like linen"), with no loops or scaffold. Final line "lace learning the shape of weather" recharges opening motif flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms euthanasia tourism through Arctic disaster relief—endings become communal "sighs," not spectacles. Risk-taking heightens stakes: rejecting passive observation for active listening as salvation. Emotional truth in specifics (parasol chip, net-mending lullaby) avoids cliché. Slight familiarity in "drift-ice marina" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
