<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s "earnestly naive" trait drives tangible choices (e.g., counting drips, holding griefs) with visible cost in his death. Brittleness of devotion manifests in micro-choices like tears syncing with the bell’s rhythm, avoiding label-speak. Minor deduction: dolphin’s thematic line risks abstraction but stays embodied in Kael’s physical reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Earned Stasis: Kael’s death halts the drip, but the ocean persists through communal continuity, with cost legible in "he didn’t wake" and the cracked bell. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via drip-rate escalation; pattern taught early and paid off in the final drip’s birth of a fish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bell (micro-setting) constrains every choice—Kael hangs it, counts drips, weeps into it—and charges the final image where its drip births fish. Sensory details ("tasted like iron and memory") are selective and POV-rooted, avoiding white-room syndrome. Cap at 8.9: no environment/tool beyond the bell shapes tactics, but it suffices for micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: doubling drip rates force endurance, culminating in the seventh-day wave. Cost is visceral (his death) and conceptual (brittle faith’s fragility). Minor deduction: "faith" stake isn’t tested until the dolphin’s mid-story intervention, slightly delaying pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell’s drip-rate progression and communal continuity, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("drip every 47 seconds... a fish is born") reweights "brittle devotion" as enduring ritual without stating a moral. Near-deduction: dolphin’s "rebuild the sea but not the faith" borders on thematic echo but stays embedded in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Kael’s focus on temporal precision ("47 seconds") and salt-crusted textures reflects his mage training. Rhythmic control under pressure via fragmented counting; elision (time jumps) taught early ("seven days") and paid off in the drip-rate shift. No head-hopping; POV stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("It wept. A single drop..."). "47 seconds. 46. 44." progression is purposeful rhythm, not template cadence. Deduction: "brittle kind that keeps a widow polishing boots" slightly drifts into abstraction mid-escalation, dulling pressure by 0.3.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: "brittle devotion" redefines magic as fragile persistence, not power. Drip-rate mechanics transform a scientific detail into emotional logic. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the ocean’s return feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
