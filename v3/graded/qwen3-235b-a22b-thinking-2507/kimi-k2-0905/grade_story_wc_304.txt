<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the emerald realization: her spark, not the dead's, is the true artifact. Embodied micro-choices (sable wand from cut hair, pressing chip to sternum) reveal hierarchy of values with visceral cost—dissolution for memory preservation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "she dispersed, particles of radiant hush drifting upward." Conceptual cost (her life for 342 sparks) is legible in the aurora's "recognition," with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding through pattern-harvesting to final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto functions as micro-setting: condensation-fed pool constrains infusion ritual, while ice orchids become seeded constellations post-dissolution. Aurora’s color shifts directly charge emotional beats (dimming for hush, flaring for transaction).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: harvesting 342 patterns narrows her path to self-sacrifice. Cost is felt in the emerald’s transformation into "a lantern," though the singular tightening lacks a mid-scene trade-off beyond the final dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final image ("dissolved into aurora") resonates as non-literal answer: beauty as ferryman requires becoming the river. Theme emerges from corpse-patterns-to-constellations shift, avoiding moralizing despite the closing line’s wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "rigor mortis traced maps across cooling flesh" filters through mortician’s gaze. Rhythmic control under pressure ("water rose to her ankles, her knees, her heart") avoids lyricism marring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No closure-adjacent artifacts, but "fractured across a thousand crystal stalactites" risks density overload. Propulsion stumbles slightly in backstory block ("seven years... first client"), though anchored by emerald chip’s tactile cue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "memento mori" trope through occupational specificity: beautician mortician’s tools (sable wand, emerald chip) and "patterns in static" method feel inevitable. Risk-taking (dissolution as triumph) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
