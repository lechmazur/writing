<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Luma’s embodied joy/sorrow duality ("sigh of present sorrow" vs "laughter echoing"), but micro-choices lack tangible stakes beyond emotional cost; grandfather memory feels earned though never on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the dissolving fragment grafting the mural crystallizes Luma’s realization ("joy had never been lost") with visceral cost in "heart over-exposed"; Accumulative lens holds through fog’s evolving pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fog functions as active micro-setting—constraining light manipulation and charging the final image ("pewter quilt" vs mural’s "private dawn"); sensory details ("plaster smelling of fermented stars") filter through Luma’s artistic bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically as the film’s requirement for a "living wall" narrows options, but conceptual cost ("sigh of present sorrow" per brushstroke) slightly abstracts physical trade-offs; agency in painting remains compelling under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the grafting fresco fragment reweights "lost joy" as developed light, avoiding moralizing; final image ("refilling orchard with color") offers resonant, non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("light pooled in her veins," "spectral dust"); rhythmic control under pressure ("sinoper, lapis, copper-resinate") teaches its lyric pattern early, with fog’s dome paying off compression at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic laughter" and "fermented stars" show high-density imagery without muddle, though "bruised pewter" risks slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat without pattern reinforcement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms magical realism tropes via specific constraints (light-painting, fog network); "pensive mirth" synthesis feels inevitable, with cider-house closure offering fresh inflection on joy’s reclamation through artistic risk.</comment>
