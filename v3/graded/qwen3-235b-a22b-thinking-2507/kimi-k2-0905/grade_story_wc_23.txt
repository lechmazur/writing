<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through tactile details (compass hand spinning free, mercury tears) rather than labels; micro-choices like soldering hair reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost during pivotal hydraulic repair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in dissolution sequence ("Weight left her; the stitched seams loosened"); Accumulative lens holds through moon-phase pressure, with hydraulics failure creating coherent orientation anchor by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Starlit signal station functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice—from dish manipulation to censer placement—while the bronze censer foot’s moon-dependent weight directly charges the final image of crumbled dust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation via "build backward" action under Accumulative lens; cost crystallizes when coat grows heavy as moon sets, with moon-phase constraint altering tactics during hose-soldering and censer-speaking beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (reversing dunes, naming vanished) not moralizing; final image of starlight flowers offers resonant answer to "geography of loss" without stating a moral, resisting false equivalence in grief’s complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "patina bronze censer foot rubbing into thigh like a bruise shaped like home"; rhythmic control under pressure ("12:33," "12:47") avoids head-hopping despite phone voices, with elision taught early via "geography of loss has no area codes."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "veins begging for a heart" metaphor deepens closure without muddle; every line propels momentum (e.g., "boots between the bronze foot and the metal veins" compresses spatial choreography and emotional stakes).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms migration tropes through specific logic of "reverse migration as translation," with emotional truth in "raw solace shaped like a lullaby sung through teeth"; risk-taking (stitching self from maps) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
