<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the unsnapping act: duty versus surrender manifests through trembling fingers and armor "falling away in petals of rust." No diagnostic labels; embodied cost of becoming "the thing possibility abandoned" charges the final transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the wooden knight’s "hollow chest" humming with "unchosen futures" reconfigures possibility’s nature under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in "silver sap sealing cracks of fear"—a factual mystical price legible in the final image’s alchemical heartbeat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Upside-down orchard constrains every choice: gravity-reversing sap dictates movement physics, clockwork seeds bleed possibilities crushed underfoot. The greenhouse roof peeling away during the exchange proves environment charges the final image’s mercury-sky transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through deepening: "capturing possibility" shifts from physical choreography to existential trade ("Trade your armor for my wooden skin"). Cost crystallizes when armor falls as "petals of rust"—a visible price that alters tactics by making the knight a "crease" for reality’s bend.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "the shape of possibility was never a single thing to capture but a continuous folding" arises from sap-coated limbs and humming futures. No moralizing; the final image of the universe "lean[ing] closer to watch" reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature remains fiercely consistent: "armor blackened by shame" and "fruits cracked open to reveal clockwork seeds" filter all details through the knight’s melancholic interiority. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks in the transformation sequence’s staccato immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "leaves of gold foil rustled" compresses setting and emotion. Minor deduction for "shivering bliss" repetition (lines 23/53), but even this serves thematic resonance. Zero scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or stakes with crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through granular logic: upside-down orchard’s gravity rules enable the mercury-sky climax; "murmured allegiance" isn’t vague magic but a binding contract that crystallizes in the puppet’s dialogue. Emotional specificity in "rehearsing forgotten patterns for the day another seeker would arrive" avoids archetype.</comment>
