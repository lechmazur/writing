<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lirael’s motivation to "shape a new dawn" is embodied in micro-choices (tightening wick, pressing it to lens) and earns her shift from herald to reader. Interior contradiction ("came only to steer the night, not to birth a sunrise") drives agency, but secondary pressure from the geas lacks tangible friction beyond conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the lighthouse dissolving into "dew that had never known ink" crystallizes the cost of vanishing wick and rearranged stars. Accumulative lens holds through density shifts (laughter multiplying, ink bleeding into sail), though the "accidentally prophetic" catalyst edges toward coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass wick functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (igniting without oil, consuming itself) and charges the final image ("shadow the first letter"). Sensory details like "granite blocks groaned, then glided" reflect urgency while avoiding symbolism, though "porcelain echo" slightly strains physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (steering night vs. birthing dawn) tighten through Lirael’s agency—her laughter ignites the wick and billows the sail. Cost is unmistakable in "wick consume itself" and "stars, thinning," but the prophecy’s accidental nature slightly undermines escalation’s causal purity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "ancient shadows are the ink of unborn mornings" becomes literal as inkless dawn prints on the planet’s retina. No thematic echo; the final line ("portable lighthouse under a sky where print had died") reweights the premise without moralizing, though "geas" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in Accumulative mode: "starlight entered... folded into corridors of green fire" filters physics through Lirael’s mythic lens. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("laugh cracked, a porcelain echo"), and elision (skipping tide’s return) is taught early via routine. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion excels ("ocean of post-newsprint silence reflected emerald glow"), but "whale remembering harpoons forged from obsolete type" risks mixed metaphor. Zero loops; final line recharges motifs with "shadowed elation" specificity. Minor density in high-pressure beats prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of lighthouse myth with post-print era: "newsprint jellyfish" and "dawn printed directly onto the retina" transform tropes through emotional specificity. Risk-taking (laughter erasing stars) heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the "blank page" reconfiguration feels earned.</comment>
