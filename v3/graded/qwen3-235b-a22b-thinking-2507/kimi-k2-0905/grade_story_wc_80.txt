<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between Mara's stoicism and visceral sensitivity ("winced as if the sound had come from inside her own chest") is embodied and consistent. Her final choice to seal confessions into stone—foreclosing communication while preserving memory—earns closure through prior causality, though micro-choices lack layered irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: Mara's submerged confessions reweight "abandoned dreams" into permanent artifacts. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through escalating density of sealed notes, culminating in the keystone inscription. Cost is legible in the inkwell's "weight now lighter by exactly the amount of a confession."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion constrains every choice—Mara's wading, crouching, and writing against water pressure charges the final image. Sensory details ("rustled chains swaying like censers," "oil-paper confessions") are filtered through her surveyor's precision, making the lagoon an active participant in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara's agency: sealing the first note ("You loved me only when the band played waltzes") tests commitment to her archaeological mission, while the keystone inscription ("I am here to mourn what we almost kept") narrows options to silent preservation. Cost manifests as emotional labor absorbed by stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts of sealing confessions into fissures, avoiding abstraction. The final image of future scholars finding fragments reweights "abandoned dreams" into permanence without moralizing, offering a resonant answer through the "hushed blaze of a drowned pavilion."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is singular: Mara's surveyor gaze transforms architectural details into emotional topography ("a code of hollows she alone could read"). Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during wading, lyrical density at the keystone—avoids elision pitfalls. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "midnight ink dissolve," "stitching a wound shut with thread made of light," and "secret bruise" avoid figurative muddle. Sentence propulsion accelerates with "crouched," "waded," "pried," then breathes at the keystone. Final line recharges the inkwell motif with devastating specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms the surveyor archetype through "interlaced absence" as both method and metaphor. Emotional specificity in confessions ("I never learned to swim because I believed you would always carry me") avoids templates. Risk-taking—lyric structure without dialogue—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
