<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shown through concrete actions (pressing orris to sill, collecting trifles) avoids abstraction; micro-choice of pocketing tissue instead of needle reveals growth. Slight abstraction in "sanctify absence" motivation lacks earlier friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise RR lands cleanly: compass stillness crystallizes "conversation" cost ("some absences need no filling"). Orientation clear by line 3; accumulative lens taught early via "slow mutations" density. Cost proof in "hushed blaze of recognition."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (orris root, compass) charges closure: violet flare "deepened shadows" reconfigures final image. Sensory hierarchy flawless—"powdery iris note bloom" filtered through Elara’s expertise; bay evolves causally from "sparkled" to "fraction straighter."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (sanctifying absences) tightens through density: "porches leaning" → "living cavities" → "conversation" reconfiguration. Agency clear in ritual choices; cost legible in "hush that keeps world from shaking." Minor escalation dip before net-shack sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: "assembling confession from pronouns" avoids moralizing. Final image ("gulls rehearsed cries against hush") reweights premise with conceptual cost. No thematic echo—insight earned via compass stillness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "sodium glow thinning like memory against bone" reflects perfumer’s POV. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure ("powdery iris note bloom, and the glass shivered"). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "violet flare that did not illuminate but deepened shadows" shows high-density propulsion. Near-loop in "drank the scent, the powder, the quiet" barely avoids synonym churn. Final line’s "rehearsed their cries" perfect cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "creeping normality noticer" transformed via ritual mechanics (displaced objects, compass physics). Risk-taking heightens stakes—houses sighing "in unison" avoids sentimentality. Derivative premise guardrail cleared by orris root specificity.</comment>
