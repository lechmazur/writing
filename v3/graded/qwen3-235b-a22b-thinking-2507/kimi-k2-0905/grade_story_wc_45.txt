<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s embodied contradiction—skeptic yearning for certainty while tasting "chalk and thunder"—drives every micro-choice; her final placement of the tooth reconfigures her value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost: the rewoven hedges and "bright fractures" map reweight truth’s cost without neat resolution, under a held Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The garden’s bone-pavers and vertebra sundial constrain Elara’s movement and choices, culminating in the final image where pear trees and "ribs of the world" charge the closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation via textural deepening narrows options when Elara confronts the yew log’s role in feeding the town, forcing moral calculus that reconfigures the lie’s stakes with felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the constellation map’s ink-salting transformation—"radiant because of, not despite, the cracks"—avoiding moralizing while offering resonant, non-literal wisdom in the final lantern imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("opalized, root curled like a fetus") and rhythmic control persist under stress; lyric compression taught early pays off in the closure’s "bright fractures" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "bruised mint and iron" and "splints for the season of falls" exemplify high-density propulsion, though "narrative clock awareness" during reflection risks slight dilation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms changeling trope through "fraud had been tender" specificity and bone-setting parallelism; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
