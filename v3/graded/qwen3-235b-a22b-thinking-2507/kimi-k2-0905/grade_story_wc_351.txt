<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("chaotically precise" screwdrivers vs. watchmaker care) and embodied cost (bloodied scalp, quivering muscles) earn closure. Final renunciation of immediate success for persistent hunger feels inevitable through synaptic rewiring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: moonlight shearing away creates undeniable cost (engines to dust, voices fading), while pockets of sketches reconfigure stakes. Accumulative lens holds through density shifts in lunar alignment and synaptic rewiring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Canyon walls glinting with new quartz seams directly charge the final image, constraining Mara’s ascent. Micro-setting (gasket pressure, copper lace grit) evolves with action, avoiding static description through "shards of drill-bit rose, magnetized by blueprint."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when moon slides—visible cost (engines clattering to dust) forecloses extraction. Agency-driven escalation via helmet calibration ("twitch of wrench both error/correction") narrows options under Accumulative lens, though corporate collapse backstory lacks pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Final image of "walking the rim where transformation never ceased" reweights "abandoned dreams" as persistent hunger without moralizing. Basalt wings sketches embody earned subtext: dreams survive as blueprints, not resurrected machines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "fracture in walls reflecting lunar silver like broken periscope mirror" filters geology through engineer’s gaze. Rhythmic control under stress ("cold fire crawled over her skull") avoids uniformity despite dense imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "synaptic plasticity gone feral" compresses complex ideas without muddle. Minor density risk in "helical, tightening until she could not tell which longing belonged to whom," but payoff in marrow turbines justifies figurative weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "entangled memories" trope through quartz veins as literal coolant and basalt wings as tangible output. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off via Charged Poise closure—no gimmickry, pure emotional specificity in "pockets sagged with sketches she did not remember drawing."</comment>
