<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses manifest concretely: balancing on rafters while mapping dust motes embodies her tension between control and surrender. Final departure as "Archivist of Airborne Refrain" earns renunciation through cataloging archives and building pigeon loft, with meteorite chip as tangible cost anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: meteorite chip pulsing beneath floorboards crystallizes the cost of erasure versus remembrance. Dust motes' "brief, bright chord" reconfigures meaning under Accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual cost—"last evidence that Mirela had ever balanced."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Dust motes under skylight constrain choice (teaching balance) and charge closure via "blooming, withering" chord. Attic isn't backdrop but active pressure: floorboards hide meteorite, disbound atlases hold Inkspot, disused space enables sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation through Accumulative density: sorted archives deepen "human refrain" weight until constables' arrival forces departure. Cost legible when they find "only Mr. Blackwood reciting Tennyson," making Mirela's physical erasure tangible through absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Inkspot's micro-sheet deliveries and children's rope-jumping—no stated moral. Final dust chord offers resonant answer to "can beauty survive erasure?" via "unfinished cadence inviting the next climber," avoiding sentimentality with "crusts of bread for proof that beauty could still fit inside a claw."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "oil-drop eyes that reflected the attic’s blooming withering light" filters setting through Mirela’s sensory focus. Under pressure, syntax compresses ("learning to trust again across learning to trust again") without losing texture or consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; every line advances pressure: "tasting iron from the meteorite chip—proof that somewhere, worlds survived collision" fuses sensation, symbol, and stakes. Metaphors stay coherent ("feathery envelopes" ties to paper trails) with no register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms refugee tropes via pigeon courier trained on Chopin etudes. Meteorite chip as memory vessel avoids cliché by linking cosmic scale ("travelers belong to no regime but gravity") to tactile cost—children hum unaware of its origin, synthesizing loss and persistence.</comment>
