<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied micro-choices (prodding leaf, building acorn cup), but lacks contradictory impulses during monument construction—determination dominates without tension between order and memory-keeping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: releasing the dust speck creates conceptual repricing where memory becomes weight, with visible cost in Mireya’s irreversible transformation ("moss-covered fingertips" anchoring felt consequence).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The moonstone dust speck constrains every key choice (decoding runes, building monuments) and charges the final image—its release literally lifts memories skyward, making micro-setting indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative/Textural lens: rising leaves narrow options as runes accelerate, but the pressure shift from "leaves fall upward" to spirals lacks tangible cost until the seventh dawn’s release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through monuments ("laughter of extinct starlings"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights memory as weight, with "sky will remember you" crystallizing reciprocity without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in seed-sorter lexicon ("moonlight struck them," "pollen spirals"), but minor register drift occurs when "folklore claimed" intrudes on Mireya’s experiential voice during moonstone handling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat; density remains high but avoids muddle with purposeful rhythm shifts at monument constructions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms memory tropes through specific labor (seed sorting) and tangible forgetting ("extinct starling laughter"); the skyborne arbor’s logic—memory as weight—feels inevitable yet revelatory in its emotional precision.</comment>
