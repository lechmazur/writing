<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Maya’s grief-driven quest yet nuanced restraint prevents therapy-speak; brother’s silent duality embodies conflict but secondary pressure lacks friction as Dr. Voss feels functional not organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost—twin heartbeats synchronizing then vanishing—under Accumulative/Textural lens; disorientation pays off in the topology fold reveal but Luc’s sudden appearance risks coincidence compounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent spores and laser pointer constrain every choice; "ionized air" and fungal breath charge the final image; sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows under pressure to stipes and footfalls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming Luc) tightens through spatial revelations; merging Lucs forecloses Maya’s path with felt cost but Dr. Voss’s exposition slightly softens the moral calculus of "revolutionizing closure."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through spores copying shapes and laser dots skipping space; final light dispersal reweights grief without moralizing though "compassionate forgery" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "nested topographies" and "porous, inviting" shelves; rhythm modulates from fragmented pulses to flowing cadence at merger; no head-hopping despite dual Lucs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "quiet wildfire" motif earns density; "spatially gifted" slightly over-told but offset by concrete breadcrumb actions; final bird-note leak avoids purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of topology physics with grief; laser pointer’s humble origin transforms trope; risks poetic abstraction but "spores copying shapes" grounds emotional truth in bioluminescent specificity.</comment>
