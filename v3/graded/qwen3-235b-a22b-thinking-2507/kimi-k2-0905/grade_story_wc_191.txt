<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lore keeper’s motivation is clear but interiority lacks contradictory impulses; "futuristic nostalgia" is abstract label violating diagnostic-speak anti-pattern. Final choice feels earned though, with visible cost in accepting responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: throne room arrival crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("bridge, not monarch"). Orientation Test waived—kaleidoscopic disorientation pays off in ending’s color-shifted sunrise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (ruby flakes) charges final image via reconstitution, but hidden orchard remains ornamental backdrop. "Geological strata" paint metaphor constrains discovery process, though bioluminescent fruit lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (race against sunrise) signaled early but pressure doesn’t escalate meaningfully—waterfall’s color shift is stated not shown through narrowing options. Sunrise arrival happens exactly as planned, violating Band guardrail for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges immaculately through murals and crown reconstitution: "balance between progress and tradition" shown, not told. Final image ("bridge, not monarch") reweights throne’s meaning without moralizing, avoiding Thematic Echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("peeled like old skin," "frozen blood" similes) but minor register drift—"plasma torch" feels techy amid lyrical prose. Consistent psychic distance under pressure, no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One paraphrase loop: "paint peeled like old skin" followed by "layers accumulated like geological strata." "Futuristic nostalgia" is abstract label violating Overwriting Checks. Otherwise high density with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh myth-sci-fi synthesis avoids trope safety middle; "crown reconstitution atom by atom" transforms ascension cliché. Risk distinction for genre-blending (+0.3), though stairway concept lacks non-obvious angle.</comment>
