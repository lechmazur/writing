<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("patient as drought-grass"), with contradictory impulses (strategic restraint vs. urgency) visible in the arrow-flicking and seed-planting. Motivation ("plant resilience") earns closure through embodied action, though flaw integration lacks deeper complication beyond competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds: sensory density and musical pattern (C, E♭, G, B♭) escalate pressure toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in regime's imminent return and scattered seeds, but timeline compression slightly weakens causal escalation during guard confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: piano bench decodes location, netting traps guards, cellophane arrow distracts. Carnival details charge closure ("seeds sleeping below"), with sensory hierarchy reflecting urgency (e.g., "dust rolled through the midway as sunlight poured in like brass band music").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seeds vs. regime) tightens meaningfully as wall falls, forcing non-lethal impeding. Agency-driven escalation (dancing guards backward) narrows options, with cost visible in regime's dusk reclamation. Single deepening suffices, though secondary conflict lacks interweaving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: scattering seeds "with reverence a child saves a ticket" reweights liberation without moralizing. Final image ("dry soil cracked wider") delivers non-literal answer to "what you plant afterward," avoiding thematic echo or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rust-grass patience," musical cipher) with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from lyrical ("sunlight pouring in like brass band music") to urgent ("boots scuffed beyond buckled door"). Minor register drift in "staggeringly graceful" phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but synonym loops ("patient and strategic" repetition) and slight figurative muddle ("dust rolled... like brass band music"). Zero scaffold in closure; final line’s chord hum elegantly recharges motif without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival tropes (Tilt-A-Whirl vault, teddy-bear feathers) transforms rebellion narrative. Specific verifiable details (minor seventh cipher, heritage grains) avoid abstraction. Risk-taking (accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though premise edges near allegory.</comment>
