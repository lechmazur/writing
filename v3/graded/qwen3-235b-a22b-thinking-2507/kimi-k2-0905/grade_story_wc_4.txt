<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in tactile ritual (pressing key into photo) shows contradictory impulses; micro-choices like whispering to bee reveal embodied emotion without labels. Final shared transmutation earns closure via prior causality, though grandchildren's arrival lacks sufficient friction to test stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: unused space "yawned like tomorrow" and footprints spelling "linger longer" crystallize the archivist's vulnerability in sharing healing. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with spiral alignment deepening pressure toward the dove formation's emotional reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lavender field functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—purple-soled kneeling alters photo alignment tactics—and charges the final dove image with scent/memory grafting. Rust/honey air evolves causally from "diesel remembered" to collective exhalation, avoiding static symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting pain) tightens through the archivist's ritual escalation: key insertion dents photo paper, inviting witnesses. Cost is unmistakable in the "unused space that yawned like tomorrow," but grandchildren's effortless awe lacks sufficient opposition to elevate pressure beyond gentle deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Final dove image reweights "pain folded into beauty" without moralizing—the boy's laugh cutting "fresh gratitude" shows earned thematic resonance. Avoids false balance by letting the factory's ghosts remain shadows within the spiral, making healing specific to lavender-field alchemy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "vines climb—slow, inevitable, fingers tasting every crack" with rhythm mirroring archival patience. Zero head-hopping; compression ("soles purple with blossoms") taught early pays off in closure's cursive footprints. Slight register drift in "conceptual repricing" phrasing barely touches peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "curling like autumn lips" and "rust seemed to chuckle" achieve high density without muddle. One borderline-purple phrase ("marriage of rust and bloom that felt like forgiveness practicing its vows") risks overwriting but stays anchored to character lexicon. Final line's cursive footprints avoid sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "healing through art" trope via specific archival mechanics—silver key in photo heart, arc alignment—making transmutation feel earned. Risk-taking in mosaic closure (dove formed from disparate photos) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "unused space" underscoring irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
