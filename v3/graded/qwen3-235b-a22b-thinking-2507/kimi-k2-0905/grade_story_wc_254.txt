<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear ("stride through sacred borders") but interiority leans abstract; "tremor of certainty" lacks embodied contradiction despite strong micro-choices like risking re-freezing calves during the phoneme shift. Final endurance earns cost through self-erasure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with cost (poet's dissolution into rumor), but "felt cost" remains oblique; citizens' uncertainty about borders/stanzas reweights stakes yet lacks concrete on-page price beyond thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz colonnade actively constrains choice—A-flat pillars singing louder when touched directly enable law's paraphrase, and "ice became membrane" charges the final image where the lake "rewriting its surface" embodies the closure's conceptual shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the single phoneme change ("stay" vs "pass"), with physical cost in hairline fissures and re-freezing risk, but escalation lacks visceral progression; the "tremor of certainty" remains abstract rather than viscerally felt pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing while offering resonant closure: "borders are parentheses we forget to close" reweights the premise through action, and citizens tasting "quartz music" implies earned thematic complexity without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("ice tremble with certainty," "taste of quartz music"), but rhythmic control falters in mid-beats; "lantern-moth hush" repetition borders on template cadence despite otherwise purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "rewrote its lattice" and "fogged the crystal" show high density. Minor overwriting in "water that had forgotten how to be solid" slightly dulls propulsion but doesn't obscure closure's crystalline image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic and poetic acts ("paraphrase the boundary law") feels inevitable, but "cloud-shadow poet" verges on archetype; risk-taking elevates stakes yet some tropes ("shuttered skies") lack full transformation.</comment>
