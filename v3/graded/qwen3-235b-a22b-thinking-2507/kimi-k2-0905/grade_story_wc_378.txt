<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (nostalgia vs. protocol) drives credible endurance; "inner static" edges toward label-speak but embodied via memory-dust visions and chest-plate merger. Micro-choices like opening the box deepen stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the farm compresses but fears transform into hope-seeds. Magnetic shift anchors orientation early; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens pressure toward the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Desert roses constrain choices via oil timing and magnetic ignition; final image of the contained rose charges closure. Glass dome’s fragility and organic box’s merger with K-17 create micro-setting pressure on tactics and the ending’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (farm preservation vs. fear transformation) escalate through K-17’s agency: opening the box, planting itself. Magnetic shift acts as live clock narrowing options, but external pressure slightly overshadows protagonist-driven tightening at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: fears becoming hope-seeds, miniaturization as preservation. Final image—"neither android nor memory, but both"—resonantly answers "nostalgia as carrying forward" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct android POV: "servos hummed with memory fragments," "synthetic skin" lexicon. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("roses burned blue and gold, their flames writing the children’s names"). No head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("controlled burn escape route through carefully maintained chaos"). "Fragmented wholeness" repetition slightly muddles peak beats but doesn’t obscure closure. Propulsion flawless except minor abstraction in "conceptual cost" phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android nostalgia + desert farm + magnetic physics. Avoids trope safety via specific stakes (oil-dependent burn timing) and emotional truth in fear-to-hope transformation. Derivative premise guardrail narrowly avoided through lived detail.</comment>
