<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hound's internal conflict lacks layered embodiment despite strong micro-choices (Jun's stamp); Marta's shoreline lullaby voice shows contradictory impulses but epiphany edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (the journey's purpose revealed), Accumulative lens held consistently; minor orientation debt in ridgeway's shifting nature doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ticket punch (tool) constrains climax choice and charges final image; sensory specificity occasionally lapses into generic twilight/mist tropes but micro-setting integration meets 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through environment (tangled routes), but resolution relies slightly on convenience (stamp instantly fixes hound); agency clear though cost lacks physical manifestation beyond realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ticket punch symbolism and hound's arc; Marta's dialogue skirts thematic echo but avoids final-paragraph moralizing, landing resonant non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (guide-specific noticing) and rhythmic control excel, but "liminal shore" register drift clashes with POV lexicon during high-pressure search.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No closure-impairing loops; minor scaffold in "amber pools"/"deepening dark" clichés, but high density and final-line propulsion prevent 9+ eligibility per text-artifact rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry guides with star-stamp mechanics transforms guardian trope; emotional specificity avoids abstraction, though "unused courage" premise borders on familiar archetype.</comment>
