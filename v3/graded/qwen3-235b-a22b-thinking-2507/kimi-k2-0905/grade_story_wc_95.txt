<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elian's interior contradiction (conquest vs collaboration) manifests in micro-choices like the needle card extension and mechanical arm's final relaxation. Vale's "diplomatically fierce" trait lacks one visible tradeoff during the foil tap that would cement its cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the floating needle card crystallizes transformed rivalry into collaboration with felt cost in Elian's "gears settling into a new rhythm." Drive lens (Causal) holds from Vale's paper reveal to the brook's reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The brook's reflection isn't backdrop but the key mechanism completing the sundial's geometry. Its "reversal at dusk" directly constrains the climax and charges the final image of the card floating "like a blade not yet drawn."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation through protagonist agency: Elian's choice to "fence for it" narrows options from waiting to active interpretation, culminating in the tangible cost of Vale's foil tapping his shoulder—a symbolic blood draw from a lie.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the needle card's evolution from "bookmark in time" to "stitched question" vessel. Final image ("brook carried the needle card away") answers the central question without moralizing, reweighting "questions are doors" as collaborative navigation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elian's perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("brass fingers drumming," "flesh hand tracing"), while fencing dialogue carries subtext as action ("You think the missing quadrant is a message?"). No register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "hydraulic grace" and "dignified chaos" compress meaning without muddle. Final line's rhythm ("somewhere in the ticking... destination began to answer") crystallizes theme through concrete sensory pairing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of dueling philosophy and physical fencing feels inevitable through the sundial's geometry. Risk-taking (time as ethical puzzle) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming "hidden overture" into shared melody.</comment>
