<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via somatic mapping (e.g., pressing scar to name plants), avoiding therapy-speak through embodied action. Flaw: "quietly talented" trait lacks tangible social friction beyond observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "air tastes... of possible mornings" reweights "memory without optimism is a tomb" with felt cost in photograph’s release. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory dissection deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dragon’s-blood pine resin functions as micro-setting that charges closure—sealing Nadia’s image transforms it from object to living memorial. Arboretum’s roots gripping stone mirror grief’s tenacity, constraining the narrator’s stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize via somatic freeze exercise: dissecting blast as "red chrysanthemum" deepens tension between memory/optimism. Cost is visceral in tears salting soil, but lighthouse timeframe’s pressure on tactics feels atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Grief is not a landmine... but a coastline" earns resonance through arboretum’s endurance, avoiding moralizing. Final image of "possible mornings" answers "anchor optimism in realism" without stating theme—though "pearl of stillness" risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "three scents, three seconds, three somatic anchors"—rhythm mirrors grief’s pulse. Voice modulates perfectly under stress: drone→heron reframing shows compression without loss of texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "wind combs the cliff like tearing paper" pays off in photograph’s rip. Near-flaw: "pearl of stillness" borders on abstraction but is redeemed by resin-sealed photograph charging closure. Momentum flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of somatic grief mapping with botany transforms trauma tropes. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—resin-sealed photograph reconfigures "outlasting us" with emotional precision.</comment>
