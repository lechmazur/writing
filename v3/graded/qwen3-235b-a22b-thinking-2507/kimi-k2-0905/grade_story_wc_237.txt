<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (terror/trust, breath-holding/release) drive micro-choices; crystallized breath embodies grief's physical cost without diagnostic labels. Brother's memory isn't backstory but active pressure shaping the twelfth stroke.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: motes reconfigure into words with visible cost (shattered quill, split breath). Accumulative lens holds—typhoon arrival coincides with lung refilling, making cost legible in "soaked but unbloodied" tatami and snapped quill.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Floating rock's lack of railing constrains choice (terror as trust substitute); jade-inked quill reappears broken in closure. Final image ("stories know how to fly") charges the rock's three-inch drift, making environment indispensable to thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lina's held breath—lungs burning, crystallized shards pricking—as plume rises. Agency is pure protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure; cost manifests in quill fracture and "bated breath" promise fulfilled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motes becoming ink: "scars become stories" dramatized by physical transformation, not stated. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "floating rock" as relief, not escape, with conceptual cost in unbloodied tatami.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature in tactile details ("crow-quill trimmed tip against grain"); rhythm compresses under stress ("one beat, two"). Voice modulates from precise ("squid-ink mixed with powdered jade") to fragmented ("Lightning spidered") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crystallized breath" motif evolves from physical sensation to shattering motes. Final line achieves conceptual repricing without abstraction. "Lake-cold wind" in tea sip shows textural specificity replacing generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual through specific mechanics (twelfth stroke/plume timing). Fresh inflection in memories becoming "luminous sentences"; avoids template by grounding emotional truth in rune-drawing physics and typhoon's saturated hush.</comment>
