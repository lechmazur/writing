<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in thief’s hesitation to cut another fragment yet demanding the ring as collateral; embodied emotion in "tears reflecting the moon like spilled mercury" avoids labels. Flaw: thief’s moral limits lack deeper exploration beyond momentary pause.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: thief’s choice to reuse the woman’s portrait forecloses further theft with visible cost (dimmed moonbeams, satchel lighter). Causal lens holds through the ring’s inscription revealing backstory, reconfiguring stakes without retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald station’s marigold perfume and emerald tiles constrain choices (flower cipher, portrait projection) and charge closure via rearranged petals. Recurring jar and station setting directly shape tactics and final image, meeting 9+ gate with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by thief’s agency: realizing the woman’s history transforms the reinterpret action from transaction to redemption. Cost is unmistakable—thinning "fabric of someone else’s tomorrow"—and reweights the final image as moonbeams dim with reconciliation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory as both wound and remedy emerges through particulars: reconstructed face bathed in "forgiving light," petals spelling "go home, memory is enough." Final image reweights the central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("read the tremble in a stranger’s pulse as easily as a timetable") and rhythmic control under pressure ("silver scissors no thicker than a filament"). Elision of thief’s past thefts taught early and paid off via the ring’s coordinates.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("jar of captured moonbeams clinking softly against her ribs"), but "fragile evidence that beauty had once existed exactly so" risks slight overwriting. Final line’s "destiny breathing back" avoids closure muddle with crystalline resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of moonbeam physics and portrait theft transforms memory tropes; flower-cipher mechanics feel organic, not checklist. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes through emotional specificity ("luminous disbelief" evolving to "tears drying").</comment>
