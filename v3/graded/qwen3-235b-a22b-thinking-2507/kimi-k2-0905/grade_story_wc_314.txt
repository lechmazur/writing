<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (logic vs. intuition) drives action, but key climax lacks micro-choices showing struggle; "rearranged in axis" tells rather than embodies cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with indigo horizon cost, but starling coordinates feel coincidental—not earned agency—and "rearranged" abstraction weakens felt cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (mica, chalk circle) charges closure: abalone dust and bark constrain choices, while the crystal’s final hover charges the orchard’s inversion with specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully around logic/wonder tension, but escalation hinges on starling patterns—a convenience that undermines protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through crystal’s dissolution and quince fruit ripening condition; avoids moralizing, though final "sing it rightly" line flirts with thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "wind sighed through canyon" and "tasted metallic"; rhythmic control deepens under pressure without elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Overwriting in climax: "fire turned transparent... sounding like wind through empty pages" muddles sensory logic, dulling the closure image’s clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and starling patterns feels inevitable, but the "coordinates via flock" device risks derivative convenience without sufficient groundwork.</comment>
