<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s embodied empathy ("pawn that wished it were a gardener") driving rebellion; Ellis’s barefoot arrival with dripping roots reveals commitment without summary. Minor deduction for cashier/janitor feeling slightly token despite strong confessions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: pawns stepping off boards reconfigures the "fixed game" premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("questions growing like moss"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—iron leaves lifting toward cobalt ceiling crystallizes stakes without causal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt library’s "stone walls breathing cold hush" actively pressures choices—Mara’s soaked collar and atlas-shelf placement of the grotto charge closure. Micro-setting (magnetic grotto) guides her compass, constraining tactics while charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara’s agency: organizing displays tightens options (2 a.m. labor), while sapling confessions crystallize moral calculus. Cost is visceral—Ellis’s dripping roots, Mara’s starlight-soaked collar—reweighting "amplified quiet" into shared pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: cashier’s coin towers and janitor’s loose bulb embody "second thoughts" without moralizing. Final image (pawns stepping off boards) offers resonant non-literal answer to "what if losing teaches?"—zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Mara filters world through chess metaphors ("reference cards stirred like roosting birds"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—Ellis’s "voice barely dust on the air" contrasts Mara’s coaching cadence. Zero head-hopping despite multiple focalizers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "saplings in plastic cups" compresses transit while advancing rebellion. Figurative language serves pressure: "mannequins, chess clocks" propels action without muddle. Final line’s "unspoken leaves rustle" crystallizes tone with surgical precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms chess tropes through specific, lived detail—knight "dreading L-shaped fate" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (magnetic grotto as rebellion catalyst) heightens stakes coherently; cobalt library’s breathing walls feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
