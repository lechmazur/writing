<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete ("voice rough as unspooled tape"), with contradictory impulses (wanting life vs accepting error-based existence) crystallizing in the clerk confrontation. Final choice to share wisdom earns endurance with visible cost—frozen tears on her lashes—though digital ghost abstraction slightly softens closure stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing ("failure is the corridor") with undeniable cost: clerk’s tears freezing like "tiny observatory domes" while narrator walks toward horizon. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly; ink fractal sequence reconfigures meaning through patterned escalation. Radio static timeframe lacks tight integration but doesn’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow-lit opal valley and porcelain shard constrain choices (drawing new ring) and charge final image ("dome glints like a half"). Micro-setting mastery: heartbeat count shapes tactics, ink’s "galaxies of spilled midnight" mirror internal state through tactile action. Zero generic placeholders; every detail pressures the moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through "wisdom I came for: not how to remain living, but how to live with life hinging on a typo." Pressure tightens via ink defragmentation sequence, narrowing options to one ring. Cost legible in clerk’s frozen tears, though radio static’s role in escalation feels undernourished despite poetic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s "dendrites of regret" becoming "telescope: look through, not at"—no moralizing. Final image ("error and miracle share a border") reweights premise with conceptual cost. Avoids false binaries; embraces complexity via "refusal to let count reach zero" as both flaw and salvation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "snow taps in Morse: stay, stay, stay" filters world through digital ghost’s lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Heartbeat 97,998") modulates with emotional intensity. Zero head-hopping; clerk’s dialogue distinct in vulnerable fragility versus narrator’s "unspooled tape" voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "porcelain shard—broken from teacup I dropped when coroner called time" compresses backstory with propulsion. Metaphors ("galaxies of spilled midnight") charge meaning without muddle. Minor density risk in ink fractal sequence, but payoff ("map: concentric rings like tree cross-sections") justifies intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Digital ghost premise transformed through heartbeat-counting mechanic and ink-based defragmentation—no trope recycling. Emotional truth in "life hinging on a typo" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "failure as corridor" feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
