<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied grief ("face thinned by relativistic years, eyes ringed with guilt") and the compass lie, but the final choice lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in the beat—renunciation feels resolved too cleanly without visible struggle in the corridor moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the compass needle spinning toward "whatever home decided to be next" crystallizes the reweighted stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as star maps accumulate pressure toward the corridor’s reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gilded compass constrains choices (Kael’s crawl into the crawlspace) and charges the final image, but the observation deck’s temporal mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactically constraining—no visible tradeoffs from time dilation alter Kael’s actions beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the compass spins toward the impossible vector, narrowing Kael’s options to either flee or enter the crawlspace. Yet escalation leans on coincidence (the compass twitch) rather than protagonist agency, softening the cost’s causal roots despite the visceral closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the compass’s evolution—from ornamental lie to beacon of connection—with the final sketchbook caption ("True north is whoever waits for you...") offering resonant, non-literal closure. Avoids moralizing by embedding insight in Kael’s action, not declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("photon arriving like a letter delivered decades late") anchors the voice, but under peak stress (the corridor revelation), syntax doesn’t fracture appropriately—maintains lyrical density when emotional compression should shorten rhythms, slightly blunting immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "lullaby for the blessed pariah" risks slight overwriting but earns payoff through the mother’s voice. Final image ("soft scratch of pencil on cardstock") achieves crystalline propulsion, though "colder than vacuum" borders on cliché without fresh specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation and grief avoids sci-fi tropes through specific, lived detail (ration-card star sketches), but the "dead parent guiding child" framework feels derivative despite strong execution. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, yet lacks one truly unexpected inflection.</comment>
