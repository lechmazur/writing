<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arin’s claustrophobia is embodied through visceral details ("pulse rattling like loose rolling stock") and micro-choices (humming shanties, counting breaths), with her final key-grabbing choice crystallizing contradictory impulses—fear versus cartographic duty—while sealing claustrophobia underground as undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the mirror-shard reassembly into dawn-lavender vision reconfigures stakes with felt cost ("sealing her claustrophobia underground"), under an Accumulative/Textural lens where spatial mutiny’s pattern break tightens options without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The nexus’s micro-setting—rails, glass roof, compass point—constrains every choice (claustrophobia triggers, geometry shifts) and charges the final image (missing pane matching compass size), with sensory details filtered through Arin’s cartographic bias ("drafting its geometry on translucent vellum").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative density: organ reverberations warp rails into spatial mutiny, narrowing Arin’s options to stepping into the compass circle, with cost legible as permanent claustrophobia entombment that alters her future ("no longer feared small spaces").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—rebellion as spatial mutiny, not moralizing—with the final dawn-lavender vision reweighting the fallow period’s meaning; no thematic echo, as "wistful rebellion" is earned through embodied stakes ("rebellion felt wistfully necessary").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("notes sliding off curved iron ribs like slow rain") and rhythmic control under pressure (fragmented syntax during panic) sustain immersion; no filter verbs, with voice modulating from lyrical dread to resolve without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; sentences like "Spatial mutiny: distance revolted, angles went on strike" deliver multi-jobs with cadence shifts that propel momentum, while the final line’s "key knocking softly at her hip" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartographic obsession and claustrophobia transforms exploration tropes; the compass point’s physical reprise (necklace → shadow pivot → missing pane) feels inevitable, with risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
