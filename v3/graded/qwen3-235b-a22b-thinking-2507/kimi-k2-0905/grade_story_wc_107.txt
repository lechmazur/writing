<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("feared ever since the funeral") and embodied emotion ("heart loosening like ice") drive micro-choices under pressure, culminating in earned abandonment of the dome with visible cost—foreclosing her flight instinct through the relic floor's placement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: Mara's realization that "safe zones belong wherever they are needed" crystallizes her stance with felt cost (abandoning her plan), under the accumulative lens where density shifts reweight stakes via the dome's placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The control room functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (using chair for fuel, tape for seams) and charges the final image—"dripping quickened, rivulets conducting a metallic symphony"—tying environmental evolution to emotional thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pressure tightens through Mara's agency: her narration ("converting numbers into heat") and dome crafting narrow options toward the abandonment choice, with cost legible as she "realign[s] fault lines of sorrow" by staying present rather than fleeing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the dome becomes a resonant answer to "where safe zones belong," avoiding moralizing while charging the final image ("lighthouse for future wanderers") with earned ambiguity about healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice modulates perfectly under pressure: glassblower's perceptual signature ("molten glass threads," "translucence against her chest") and rhythmic shifts in narration ("Behold, the pilgrim...") avoid convergence, with free indirect style cleanly controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere or character ("planks protesting like old bones"), though "emotional tectonic shift" borders on therapy-speak but is redeemed by immediate concrete action (cradling the dome).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through glassblower's tactile lens—dome creation as active healing—while "weighty lightness" tone avoids sentimentality; risk-taking (narration as solder) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
