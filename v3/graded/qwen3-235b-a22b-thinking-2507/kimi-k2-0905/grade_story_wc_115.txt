<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's tactile skepticism—hoisting the wheel tests psychics' claims while "drowsy alertness" sharpens to "hunter’s sway." Micro-choice speaking to the dark ("take it; I’m here") directly triggers closure’s balance shift. Only slight abstraction in "secular forgiveness" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spinning wheel’s "new equilibrium" crystallizes Mara’s realization with undeniable cost (brother locking himself out). Orientation flawless by para 1; Accumulative escalation intensifies through sensory density (dripping water, sloshing wheel) without causality breaks. Final image reweights truth’s physicality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting—constraining choices (testing balance, tilting for the tag) and charging closure as "brass—recorded, balanced." Sensory details like "mineral stink of the old foundry" filter through Mara’s urgency, avoiding symbolism. Meets 9+ gate via tool-driven closure charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: rolling the wheel tests "secret slosh," unscrewing the cap forecloses doubt. Dominant stake (truth’s weight) tightens through Accumulative pressure—dripping water to clanging machines—culminating in the wheel’s stillness. Cost is visceral: "swallowed truth" transforming from "lead" to "brass" burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the valve wheel’s evolution—from "rosary beads" to "beaded gyroscope"—avoiding moralizing. Final image ("brass—recorded, balanced, bearable") offers non-literal answer to "measuring burden," reweighting guilt as secular responsibility. No thematic echo; epiphany earned via tangible appraisal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s perceptual signature dominates: "damp wool" hush, "sloshing like mercury or guilt." Syntax mirrors her state (long commas for drowsy alertness, clipped phrases for tension). Zero head-hopping; psychics’ voices filtered through her recordings. "Beads rattling like dry bones" exemplifies rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances pressure ("water dripped in slow Morse," "sloshing inside suddenly stilled"). Final image’s "brass—recorded, balanced" crystallizes accumulation without muddle. Minor deduction for "secular forgiveness" abstraction, but brass metaphor anchors it. Propulsion flawless—sentences breathe with scene rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ghost shift reframed as unresolved responsibility, not trapped souls. Valve wheel’s burden-measuring function feels inevitable yet original. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—clanging machines as "lullaby of cooling iron" avoids cliché. Transformation test passed: plot fails without Mara’s tactile appraisal.</comment>
