<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied choices: breath synchronization with memory versus the danger of igniting flash-paper creates simultaneous tension; the final renunciation of leaving earns its cost through the physical act of stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—choosing permanent exile to become the map's keeper—with undeniable cost in "he knew he would never leave"; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as rhythmic density builds to the heartbeat map's crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The copper plate (recurring object) charges closure by becoming the gramophone needle; frost-stiff fingers constrain the sealing action, and the orchard's evolution from "apple skeletons" to "living score" mirrors the alchemist’s internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through rhythmic accumulation: translating heartbeats shifts from external quest to internal surrender, but the world’s suspended breath lacks tangible escalation pressure until the heartbeat map emerges, slightly delaying meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the heartbeat map reconfigures "translation" as embodied stillness, avoiding moralizing; the final snowflakes "waiting for the next heartbeat" offer a resonant answer to absence without abstract assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "frost into perfect circles that held the shape of breathless time"; rhythmic control intensifies under pressure via cadence shifts ("north three beats, east two..."), with no head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frost-stiff fingers" and "starlight’s glow pulse" drive propulsion, but "world holds its breath" repetition risks slight cadence monotony in mid-beat despite purposeful design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of heartbeat cartography and alchemy feels inevitable; "safekept starlight" transforms tropes through specific constraints (silence to prevent ignition), though subarctic crater setting borders on familiar bleakness.</comment>
