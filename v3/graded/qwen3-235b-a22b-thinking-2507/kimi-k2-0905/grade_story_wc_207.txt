<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically (knees buckling under "tide of awe") and micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values (releasing vials as tribute). No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion avoids therapy clichés even in terror.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "the town smelled forever on the verge of rain" crystallizes irreversible transformation. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from factory's "last shift-whistle" to lagoon's "hush" reweighting existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (brass compass) constrains every choice: psychometry initiation, descent, and final dissolution into "second heart." Final image charges the recurring object by making rain fall upward, reweighting "petrichor" as "possibility unmoored."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: compass discovery → psychometric vision → vial-release tribute. Cost is legible in the hinge-state transformation ("no longer collector or delver but hinge herself"), where identity dissolution forecloses prior paths with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "dropped stories like oily rags" evolves into "breaths becoming the hush." Final image ("whistle echoing from inside her chest") offers resonant answer to "place where explanations fail" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through petrichor obsession ("catching scent of first rain on stone inside each corked tube"). Rhythmic control under pressure: fragmented syntax during vision ("Images slammed shut") contrasts with lyrical climax ("rain fell upward").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("factory exhaled its last shift-whistle") serves momentum. "Fossil confetti" risks purple prose but pays off in "powdered shell glowing faintly," avoiding figurative muddle. Final line recharges "petrichor" with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Synthesis feels inevitable: "petrichor collector" trope transformed into ontological hinge. Risk-taking (psychometry as clay-lifting) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity ("patched waistcoat sewn with tiny glass vials") avoids generic collector archetype.</comment>
