<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("feared to touch" blank interior vs. seeking stillpoint) drives action, but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality; the mapmaker's flawless execution under pressure undercuts genuine struggle despite strong embodied perception ("citrus on tongue").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "ring weightless, sky exhaling," but conceptual cost of emotional mapping lacks visceral legibility; the "wet heart of silence" pursuit remains abstract without tangible sacrifice on-page to satisfy cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and platinum ring function as micro-setting, actively constraining choices (dowsing path, translating vibration) and charging the final image ("quiet blaze inside him"); sensory details ("Braille of sound," "warm pressure like tears") are purpose-driven and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (mapping unmapped emotions) remain abstract despite lyrical urgency; pressure tightens via forest's "dark green walls" but lacks concrete opposition or trade-off—no visible price paid for the stillpoint revelation beyond the ring's weightlessness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ring's transformation ("become the map, parchment and ink"), avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights the central question with "ridges of joy, valleys of regret" offering non-literal resolution without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("taste frequencies as citrus"), but elevated diction ("alphabet of the place") occasionally drifts from character lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure is superb though minor register slippage occurs in reflective beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Near-overwriting in mid-beats ("consonants of extinct birds, vowels of children") risks muddling, but zero scaffold/loops; "Braille of sound" and "warm ink" achieve high density without sacrificing propulsion or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and emotionality feels inevitable ("tender blaze that survives after anger burns out"); risk-taking with synesthetic language heightens stakes without gimmickry, resisting abstraction through "raised lines he could read with fingertips."</comment>
