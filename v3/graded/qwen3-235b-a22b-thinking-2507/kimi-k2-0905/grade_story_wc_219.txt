<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism manifests in concrete micro-choices (pressing amber to sculpture, rejecting "return" in recorder), but spore-induced memory sequence risks diagnostic label-speak ("almond of cyanotype rinse") without sufficient embodied struggle during transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: tower's collapse erases footprints while "the reaction had begun" crystallizes cost of rejecting myth for decay. Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory reweighting of "home" from molecule to fossil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tower's physicality actively constrains choices: spring runoff slicks stairs, lichen scent permeates air, and the critical water drop from apex directly triggers climax. Final image of buried bronze faces charges closure through environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara's agency—pressing amber to sculpture initiates the irreversible spore release. Cost is unmistakable: path erased, sculptures fallen, her entire framework transformed from chasing home to studying decay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final line "studying its decay" offers resonant non-literal answer to "chemistry of homecoming," reweighting the amber's purpose from map to fossil record without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from spore-induced chemical memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct chemist's perceptual signature ("iron tang of blood," "cyanotype rinse") modulates under pressure. Voice shifts from clinical ("reaction, not reunion") to elegiac ("lung exhaling its last") without register drift or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cello made of bone" simile and spore dissolution sequence achieve high density without muddle. Final line's rhythmic cadence ("walked on—no longer chasing home, but studying its decay") propels closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "artificial pilgrimage" through chemical lens: nostalgia as "isotope," homecoming as molecular reaction. Risk-taking with quiet closure earns distinction, though offworlders' motivation slightly edges toward familiar alien-nostalgia trope.</comment>
