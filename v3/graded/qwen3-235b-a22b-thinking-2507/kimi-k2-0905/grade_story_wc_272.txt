<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans on abstract musings ("Is absence the purest pigment?") rather than embodied contradiction under stress; poetic syntax persists unnaturally during drowning. Final choice (stepping through mirror) is earned but lacks visceral micro-choices showing competing impulses in critical moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: library "folding like a paper bird ignited" while Elian becomes "a self-portrait rendered in motion." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the lighthouse's physical contraction tightens options relentlessly toward the spiral descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices: sinking walls force descent, warped quadrant blocks paths, and tarot shards become tactical tools. Final image of the spiral staircase corkscrewing into black water charges closure by transforming the lighthouse from prison to portal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (painting the unpaintable face) escalates through physical narrowing—shelves cracking, walls grinding sandstone—until descent is the only tactic. Cost crystallizes when the mirror seals cracks but reveals the spiral, not her face: grief becomes the ink.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "truer fracture" reweights fragmentation as truth. Final wave metaphor ("paint and unpaint the shore") answers the central question without moralizing. No thematic echo; the villagers' query remains unresolved, charged by the sea's patience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—an artist noticing "lunar features dripped like wax" and "hues no patron had ever commissioned." Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter phrases as walls close), with lyric compression ("questions rhetorical questions") taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances density. "Worm-gnawed atlases whose margins bled contradictory coastlines" does triple duty (setting, metaphor, theme). "Luminescent ache" risks purple prose but stays voice-anchored to Elian's artistic lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: lighthouse as tomb, tarot as memory fragments. "Truer fracture" concept synthesizes grief and artistry freshly. Emotional specificity—painting "the negative space she once occupied"—avoids generic templates while risking lyric structure that heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
