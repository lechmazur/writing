<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Luma’s embodied motivation ("pry open the sky") and contradictory impulses—chanting serenity while strategizing trades—create authentic interiority. Jax’s abrupt reappearance with "laughter-soaked" flame lacks causal setup, slightly undermining relationship stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the fused mosaic heart spelling "Remember" reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (floating hourglass sand). Minor deduction for sentry encounter’s convenient lullaby dust resolving without visible cost escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stone petals unfolding light actively constrain choices (e.g., violet/gold hues against dusk), and the kerosene rag’s transformation charges the final image. Dry moat/spiral stair remain postcard-like, missing opportunities to pressure tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically: Luma’s wager ("surrender craft forever") forecloses her path with visible cost, tightening options under causal escalation. Governor’s razor-thin nod crystallizes tension without coincidence—agency drives every turn flawlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the fused mosaic heart spelling "Remember," reweighting the eclipse’s meaning without moralizing. Governor’s "hope was a reckless weight" risks prompt-like language but stays subtextual; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("stone petals unfolding violet and gold"), but spatial choreography frays mid-climb: no clear transition from sentry encounter to battlement, triggering orientation debt that caps Q6 per cross-caps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops and masterful propulsion ("hiss escalating to roar"), but "knot hissing like a serpent of blue flame" stacks two similes in a high-pressure beat, violating density rules. Closure remains untouched—hairline slip only.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "hope vs. despair" trope via fireworks-as-metaphor; the glassy heart spelling "Remember" feels inevitable. "Wandering designer" archetype slightly familiar, but gunpowder/pine perfume specificity anchors universals memorably.</comment>
