<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete perception ("soot motes emerged, drifting like disappointed bees") and embodied contradiction (vow of silence broken to preserve words). Final choice earned by prior study of ghosts' "contextual clues," with cost in chest pressure mirroring desert heat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Alden’s whisper crystallizes stance with visible cost ("pressure equal to desert’s heat pressing against ribs"), reconfiguring covenant from burden to shared sweetness. Accumulative lens holds—fracture propagation and ghost assembly tighten options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stained glass box constrains climax (fracture must be mended in hive shell), while "scorched wasteland" setting charges final image with clover scent—a direct, costly reconfiguration of the environment’s meaning under thematic pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through fracture’s propagation and child ghost’s arrival, narrowing Alden’s options to mending or scattering words. Agency peaks in whisper decision, but escalation leans slightly passive until climax; cost legible via physical strain against desert heat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting: covenant shifts from "chain" to "comb" in climax, answered by blooming clover scent—a non-literal resolution rejecting moralizing. No thematic echo; subtext operates in gestures (child’s invisible jar offering).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wind carried ash in spirals that resembled missing bees") with rhythmic control—lyrical cadence compresses under fracture tension. "Tranquilly perceptive" repetition risks tic but serves voice consistency; zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "hush heavier than honey" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor repetition of "tranquilly perceptive" in peak beats edges toward template cadence but doesn’t obscure closure’s clarity or cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost lore via beekeeping metaphors ("covenant was not a chain but a comb") avoids tropes. Emotional specificity in Alden’s quiet endurance (not heroics) risks boldness while maintaining coherence; "blooming clover across wasteland" feels inevitable.</comment>
