<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (methodical ritual vs. trauma convulsion) drive the blood-sacrifice climax; flaw (face-blindness as mercy) earns the portrait with visceral cost in the micro-braids revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: quarry’s "exhale" crystallizes the cost of remembrance with undeniable pressure; Accumulative lens holds flawlessly as sensory density (mist, ribbon, blood) tightens toward the braids revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Quarry functions as active micro-setting: mist soaks the page forcing "dilute halos," shale anchors paper with river stones, shadows "rearrange" to charge the final image—environment directly constrains choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Juniper’s agency: slicing her palm transforms the ribbon from clue to memory-key; cost (reclaiming traumatic recognition) is legible in the "crack of stone on bone" flashback mid-ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "blood-stiffened ribbon" binding past/future reweights "face-blindness" without moralizing; final image ("city learned to see") offers resonant answer to empathy’s awakening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("mist clung like guilt," "dilute halos"); rhythmic control modulates from methodical ("anchored paper with river stones") to convulsive ("empathy convulsed awake") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pierced the dark with the lamp’s single eye" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "synthetic silk... human hair" filter-verb tendency in peak moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transcends true-crime tropes: face-blind artist’s condition transforms "evidence that doesn’t burn" into inevitable, fresh synthesis; risk (lyric density in ritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
