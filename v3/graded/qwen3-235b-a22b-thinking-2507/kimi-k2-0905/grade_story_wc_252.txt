<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied through "tenderness without danger felt foreign" and scarred palms vs. singing; micro-choices like sinking scrimshaw earn closure. Slight abstraction in "guardian of island" motivation prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to Earned Stasis ("would not chain them to decay") with felt cost (sinking scrimshaw). Orientation clear by line 3; closure charge in "horizon widened, unruled" reconfigures stakes via conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe actively constrains choices (barnacled ladder, calf-deep waves) and charges closure via "unmarked map the whale etched." Scrimshaw’s heat and kelp-locking timbers demonstrate setting-as-tactic with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: singing alters tactics when "tenderness without danger felt foreign." Cost legible in "sinking scrimshaw" as conceptual forfeiture. Whale call’s mechanics shape attempts early but resolution slightly leans on external catalyst.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "carved lovers embracing inside whale’s rib" and "detach from myth," avoiding moralizing. Final image of "unmarked map" reweights premise with conceptual cost—no stated moral, just "courage to embrace open." Slight thematic echo in "combative tenderness" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "coiling hawsers not fists," "rough hemp scars." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("lullaby and war cry"). Zero head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early via "gunpowder fizzled into salt" and paid off in closure’s cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "waves slapping calves like impatient trainers" shows multi-jobbing prose. Slight overwriting in "tears mixed with brine as heart cracked open" (redundant "cracked"/"declaration") prevents 9.5. Final image’s propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coral weapons, raft city from violence-bred timbers. "Exit wound" redefinition of guilt transforms tropes. Risk-taking (lyric escalation) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "horizon unruled by swords" avoids abstraction.</comment>
