<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine—feisty curses vs. tender ribbon handling—driving the pivotal bag-opening choice. Daughter's off-page presence limits relationship crucible, but micro-choices like "I persist, you persist" whispering earn endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis when mender bars elders, orchard deciding forgiveness; cost crystallizes in "photosynthesize into hope" fragrance. Only flaw: figs splitting to reveal scrolls feels slightly convenient despite pectin/prayer setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: ribbon as pendulum constrains grafting tactics, while "vaulted shadows" and "bark-stripped aisles" pressure her copper-bark confession. Final "petals snow" charges closure, though "deciduous vows" could be more tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally materialize—fruit feeding on apology drives grafting with copper gear. Agency tightens options perfectly: sap hissing where it touched copper forecloses easy reconciliation, reweighting cost through "infant leaves unfurling like green applause."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through ribbon's transformation; "promises are leaves" avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in daughter's cambium-touch. Near-miss: "photosynthesize into hope" edges toward thematic echo but redeemed by coconut/copper fragrance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives—"time persisting like sap in winter," "boots crunching on plaster saints"—with rhythmic control under pressure. "Endearingly feisty" label repetition slightly flattens voice, but free indirect style remains clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "green applause" metaphor risks purple prose but justified by mender's lens. Only deduction: "plum boughs/bow catch moonlight" alliteration slightly ornamental, though momentum remains taut through final grafting beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms "healing broken contracts" trope via quartz-goggles specificity and deciduous vows as literal fruit. Risk-taking shines: mosaic timeline taught early with "slipping ribbon between cracked goggles," synthesizing generational wisdom with coconut-dust realism.</comment>
