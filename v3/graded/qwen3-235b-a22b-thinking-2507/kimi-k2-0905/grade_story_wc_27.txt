<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("awkwardly confident") manifests in solitary action; micro-choices like balancing on the jib reveal hierarchy of values. Slight thematic echo in whispered stanza reduces causality tightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: shuttle launch crystallizes options with cost ("curfews cracked"). Orientation clear by 100 words; stone circle mechanics taught early avoids causality break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport functions as micro-setting: ferrocrete constrains barefoot movement, fuel crane enables climax. Opera glasses' cracked lens directly charges final image by splitting sunlight into ignition spear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: humming stone circle forces stance crystallization. Cost legible in "curfews cracked" as rebellion resumes. Pressure accumulates via sensory density (vibration to words) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Final image ("trailing song instead of fire") reweights rebellion theme without moralizing. "Remember, Reclaim, Reignite" pulses charge closure through concrete action, avoiding abstract statement. Whispered stanza nearly triggers thematic echo penalty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("soles tasting the dust," "bruise-colored sky") modulates rhythm from contemplative to urgent. No head-hopping; syntax compresses under stress ("Sparks leapt, plasma flowers bloomed").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "thunderous serenity" oxymoron deepens meaning. Near-synonym churn in "vaulted roof where swallows nested... pretending birds were ships" costs 0.1. Final propulsion ("curfews cracked, loudspeakers sparked") flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms space opera tropes via stone circle hum and lullaby-as-weapon. Emotional specificity in "confidence welded to bone" avoids generic rebellion narrative. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
