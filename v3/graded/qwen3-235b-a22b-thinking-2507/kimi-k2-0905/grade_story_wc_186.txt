<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete ("tasted the hour it last refracted") and micro-choices reveal hierarchy (prying shard despite desert muteness). Minor flaw: retrocognition's curse lacks visible struggle during pivotal skeleton scene, slightly underdeveloping blind spots.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "arms open, retrocognition now forward-cast" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("every mistake of the world"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as density shifts from shards to song, reweighting "coincidences" into meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Glass pavilion functions as micro-setting that charges closure: its "hollow ribs" and humming constrain choices (aligning prism to Polaris), while final "chord of cracked crystal" directly charges the ending image with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency—tracking star paths and prying the shard narrow options, with visible cost (desert muteness). Escalation falters slightly as the child's backstory enters via retrocognition without prior pressure, softening the middle beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the prism's refraction: "refractions of one intention" reweights the central question without moralizing. Near-miss deduction for "no fall is final" bordering platitude, but "rose glow" image rescues resonance with concrete hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature is distinct ("skylight that had once sung with dawn"), with rhythmic control tightening under pressure ("footprints later erased by salt wind"). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure's "coincidence folding into sense."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional ("thistle-blown hope" avoids cliché), but "hope in the shape of ribs" risks therapy-speak abstraction. No loops or scaffold; density soars with multi-jobbing lines like "vibrating with wind, making glass panes hum the single note they still knew."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in synthesizing retrocognition with "shard of hush" to transform post-apocalyptic tropes. Risk-taking (lyric mosaic structure) heightens stakes coherently, though "coincidences have meaning" premise edges toward familiarity without the prism's tangible physics.</comment>
