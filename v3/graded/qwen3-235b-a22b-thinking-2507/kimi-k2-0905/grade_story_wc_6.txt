<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (honor/oppose father) manifest in micro-choices like steady hands during flinch; final renunciation of resentment earned through embodied grafting ritual, avoiding therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options (growth vs. fire) with undeniable cost in "tapping it twice" Morse code; accumulative lens holds through memory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon constrains choice (water for grafting) and charges final image ("dark moon on red orbit"); volcanic sand’s texture alters tactics during trench-digging, fulfilling micro-setting gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation via memory density (courtroom gasp → dolphin lighter) reweights stake through protagonist’s breathing-down-anger choice; cost unmistakable in rippled forearm scar’s "keep going" tap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ending’s "song grow louder than crackle" reweights central question through sapling promise without moralizing; "Icarus" myth reframes arson as tragic flight, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in firefighter’s heat-aware lexicon ("handle heat without flinching"); rhythmic cadence modulates under stress with purposeful fragments ("Mara flinched, but kept her hands steady").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "grains clung like guilty fingerprints" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; final line’s "healing sky" avoids sentimentality through concrete "soft and unstoppable" clouds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms arsonist/firefighter trope via volcanic sand graft ritual; risk-taking in quiet closure earns inevitability through prior particulars like the drachma’s "listening heart" motif.</comment>
