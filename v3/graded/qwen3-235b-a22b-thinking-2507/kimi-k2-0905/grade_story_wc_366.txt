<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. grief) manifest in micro-choices like adding the fourth stone; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak ("hush press against his ribs"). Closure earns endurance through prior causality (eleven years of ritual) with visible cost (fear she "stepped over the rail").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: continuing the chain despite the lamp's death forecloses hope with cost ("horizon felt stitched with black wire"). Accumulative lens holds—density increase (stacked stones, cairn) reweights stakes without causality breaks. Cost legible via his fear of her suicide.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sea glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image ("green warmth travel through his glove to the bone"), constraining choices (bottling safety). Sensory details reflect urgency ("lamp coughed twice"), with spatial choreography coherent (cliff, stairs, rail). Closure hinges on its tactile reprise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency: lamp's death deepens stakes, prompting the cairn of apology stones. Cost unmistakable—his grief for the child's skiff materializes in pink granite, altering tactics (bottling absence). One tightening suffices; coincidence never resolves pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ritual: "bottling the moment its absence was witnessed" reweights memory as resistance. Final image ("bottled glass held a memory of radiance") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Complexity avoids false equivalence—safety is fragile but sufficient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("warmly observant eyes read the tower’s mute Morse"); syntax compresses under stress ("tonight the dark came sooner"). Zero filter verbs, rhythmic control heightens pressure ("waves combed the rocks with steady hunger"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("salt-ghost of every ship" does triple duty). Figurative language sparse but potent ("lenses hung like frozen tears"). Minor verb agreement slip ("warmth travel") in final beat avoids 9.5 but doesn't dull closure. Propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ritual transforms lighthouse trope—stacking stones as communication feels inevitable. Emotional specificity (grief via pink granite stone) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (off-page keeper) heightens stakes without gimmickry; synthesis is fresh yet coherent.</comment>
