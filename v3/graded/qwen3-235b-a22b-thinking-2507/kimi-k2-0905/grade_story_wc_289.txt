<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "forging other people’s hearts had left her own unaddressed," but the thematic insight about "the thread that connects all things" edges toward abstract overstatement, slightly diluting embodied motivation at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise is flawless: "lighter by the exact weight of one thrush’s nest" crystallizes cost, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through color-density escalation to the resonant "I am here / We know" exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery—the twig spiral constrains the climax by weaving the red thread—while the lotus temple’s stone petals actively shape choices (e.g., pontoon chimes altering hesitation), charging the final image with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via sensory density ("rose bleeding into gold..."), narrowing options through the twig’s dissolution, but the dominant emotional isolation stake remains slightly abstract despite visible cost in her shed weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: the "thread" metaphor evolves from projection to skin-henna to final dialogue, reweighting connection without moralizing—epitomized by "The door is open; come barefoot, come thunder, come thread."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("prismatic quiet," "colored light flung back"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("doves scattering feathers that turned into paper airplanes"), no head-hopping, and lyrical compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; only the opening’s "prismatic quiet that made her forget why she had come" risks slight density, but rhythmic variation ("I still keep your laugh in my coat pocket") and zero scaffold uphold closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms ghostwriting trope through the thrush’s nest mechanic, with bold structural risk (Accumulative design) heightening emotional stakes—evident in doves scattering paper airplanes bearing her ghostwritten lines.</comment>
