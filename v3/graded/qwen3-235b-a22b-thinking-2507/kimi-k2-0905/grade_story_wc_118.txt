<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices: probing scorched diaries with a brush reveals her hierarchy of values over mere curiosity. Final renunciation of solitude carries visible cost ("traded her final solitude") earned through tactile engagement with the fragment’s warmth and the silo’s tremor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "traded her final solitude" crystallizes the stakes while the blank tapestry and vibrating shelves reconfigure the world’s axis. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—density builds via diary discoveries until the final image rewires meaning through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (tapestry fragment) constrains choice and charges closure: its warmth against her ribs drives the decision to lay it on concrete, culminating in dragons transferring to the silo’s curvature. Sensory details ("cooled ember and graphite," "copper glow") serve urgency without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens: each diary deepens her understanding of the displaced axis, narrowing options until the child’s revelation forces the final choice. Cost ("traded her final solitude") is unmistakable in the starless departure, charged by the silo’s realignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the displaced axis reweights power structures via the mason’s "loose stone," culminating in a non-literal answer where walls "tell their own story." No moralizing—resonance lives in the blank tapestry and vibrating shelves.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable: her noticing ("spine cracked open like a scream," "threads tightening like muscles") reflects an archivist’s attunement to narrative tremors. Rhythm modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during diary probing—without sacrificing lyrical control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or plot. Figurative language ("bronze quiet," "cylinder of night") remains coherent under Accumulative pressure. Final image ("the story, at last, carried her") achieves crystalline resonance without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through specific, grounded choices: the silo library’s tactile history and "displaced axis" as tangible power geometry feel inevitable. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, anchored by emotional truth in solitude.</comment>
