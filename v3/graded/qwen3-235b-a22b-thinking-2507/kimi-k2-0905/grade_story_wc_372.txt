<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her dual role as preserver and translator of grief, with embodied cost (coughing blood onto mercury) proving stakes. However, "converting death of meaning into numbers" edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient physical anchoring in the beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: data transmitted into tree sap crystallizes the cost of preservation ("sweet and meaningless"), with mercury tablet’s temperature dependency creating undeniable conceptual stakes. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through vow decay’s patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen mercury tablet constrains every action (recording before thaw) and charges the ending by releasing data into xylem. Micro-setting mastery: frost on eyelashes melting during wonder’s resonance shows environment actively shaping emotional revelation without symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through vow decay’s pattern break (loyalty snapping into static), with mercy’s collapse causing physical cost (coughing blood). One tightening suffices, but stewardship’s ultraviolet decay feels slightly abstract versus visceral blood-on-mercury stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is ice-cold precise: "breath crystallized into tiny alphabets" filters reality through her archival mindset. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when vows shatter ("golden chord... cracked the slide"), with zero head-hopping despite single-POV intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dandruff from a dying god" risks purple prose but earns its place through visceral stakes. Only borderline artifact: "converting death of meaning" slightly overwrites in a high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding clarity harm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms library trope via physics of decay (ultraviolet stewardship, glacier-tuning forks), with risk-taking (measuring virtues as light) heightening emotional truth. Avoids abstraction through xylem data transmission—a non-obvious synthesis feeling inevitable.</comment>
