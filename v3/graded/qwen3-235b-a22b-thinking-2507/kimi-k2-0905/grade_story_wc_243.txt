<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through inked absences and locket sacrifice; micro-choice of embedding photo (not just sketching) earns closure with visceral cost. Daughter/boy parallel avoids sentimentality via embodied choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: tube burial crystallizes stakes with locket’s physical absence as felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—rising density of sensory details (barnacles, sunflowers, gulls) tightens pressure toward irreversible act without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty setting constrains every choice: tide hissing over stones forces kneeling posture, planks dictate sketching rhythm. Final image of copper tube in wood recharges covenant stones’ meaning with irreplaceable specificity—environment charges closure decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency: security’s headlights force faster sketching, then locket sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable—empty cuff’s "clean nail wound" sensation—reconfiguring "preserve weight" into active planting with irreversible physical forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through locket’s grafting onto sketch: "memory outlasts demolition" resolves non-literally as copper tube’s heartbeat weight. Final waltz with daughter reweights sunflower petals and ink into earned resonance without moralizing—cost is palpable in daughter’s gap-toothed smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "salt-rimmed plank remembered fishermen" filters setting through archivist’s vocation. Rhythmic control peaks during demolition tension—"pulse syncing with waves, ink blooming like bruised violets"—with zero head-hopping despite two-shard structure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ink blooming like bruised violets" earns density by embodying emotional state. Final line’s "demolition crews slept in motel" avoids closure dilution—propulsive cadence sustains pressure. Minor register drift in "proximate causes" (9F) costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "covenant" as rhythm (rise/fall/rise) transforms archival trope. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry—drowned boy’s absence as "negative shaped by splashes" feels inevitable in hindsight, recharging jetty’s meaning.</comment>
