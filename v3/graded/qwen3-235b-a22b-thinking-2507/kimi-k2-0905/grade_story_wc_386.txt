<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Marrow’s "weaves truth carefully" trait manifests in concrete choices (pressing palms to ice, analyzing cameos) with embodied cost—the "first unguarded expression" earned through prior restraint. Contradictory impulses (guardedness vs. connection) drive her arc without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within 50 words (who/where/when via "S.S. Caldera" dive). Accumulative lens holds through dream-fragment density, culminating in Charged Poise closure: the mirror’s reflection of "every cameo face... now at peace" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost in her unguarded smile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacier ice isn’t backdrop but constraint: it "groaned like a sleeping whale," froze Marrow’s skin to walls, and dictated the snow globe’s transformation. The recurring object charges closure as the mirror "reflects not the past but the future," directly shaping her final choice to leave it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Marrow’s agency—her analysis of cameos narrows options to tracing dream-threads. The cost crystallizes in her chest as "a second heart" when lifting the pure globe, paid in emotional vulnerability ("first unguarded expression") under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "even wreckage can cradle light" reweights via the snow globe’s journey from dream to mirror. Final image ("footprints filling with meltwater... reflects the future") offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "ghosts are fragile and the living are worse" filters all observation. Rhythmic control shifts from dreamy ("flickering like faulty film") to urgent ("glacier began to close") under pressure, with no head-hopping in pure single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("She spent three nights..." vs. "Marrow smiled"). Figurative language ("glass flowing like syrup") enhances clarity without muddle. Final line’s "future she is still weaving" charges closure with precise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific synthesis: glacier-encased liner + melted snow globes create fresh "windows of connection." Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the mirror’s payoff feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
