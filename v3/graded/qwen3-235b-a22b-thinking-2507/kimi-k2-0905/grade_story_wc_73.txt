<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grim optimism" vs. panic at stopping stairs, but "proven regret could be modeled" edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Final blood-smearing choice earns closure through embodied micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: staircase "forgetting her" reweights perpetual motion with blood's conceptual cost. Orientation anchors immediately; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Staircase functions as micro-setting constraining choice (prime counting, blood imprints), but lacks environmental interactivity beyond texture. Dice as recurring object charges final image yet doesn't alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: blood-smearing to restart stairs, counting backward. Cost is unmistakable—"scarlet timestamp" in timeless space—though panic about stopping feels slightly unmotivated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete images: dice corner balance reveals "texture" of missed opportunity, blood sigma reweights infinite series. Final dust-like settlement avoids moralizing while crystallizing conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is exquisite ("heart ticking like a gear with missing tooth"), but "balancedly daring" disrupts voice consistency. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "balancedly daring" is a lexical illusion in peak beat. Final line's "texture of missed opportunity settle over her skin like dust" achieves zero loops with devastating density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms infinite staircase trope via mathematical melancholy—"texture of missed opportunity" avoids cliché through skin friction and breath-held pause. Blood sigma as summing symbol feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
