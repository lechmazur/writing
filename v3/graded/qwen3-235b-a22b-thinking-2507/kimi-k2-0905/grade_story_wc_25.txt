<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mira's map reliance vs. acoustic revelation; micro-choices (testing whispers, tracking vibrations) reveal occupational hierarchy under pressure. No diagnostic label-speak, but grandmother's exposition slightly flattens the woman's motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the pulsing chamber crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (maps' incompleteness). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through harmonic resonance buildup, though transition to the chamber feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shipping containers function as micro-setting: rust texture and vibrations constrain choices (whisper navigation), charging the final image. Aurora's light on the coin and harmonic frequencies create sensory specificity that drives the acoustic climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through storm intensification (live clock altering tactics), culminating in the chamber's conceptual cost. Agency-driven escalation via Mira's acoustic knowledge is strong, but the key's "sound not metal" mechanic lacks mid-scene testing friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image reweights "whispers travel farther" non-literally via pulsing chamber—no moralizing. Theme emerges organically from worn coins and vibrating metal, avoiding thematic echo despite the woman's closing line staying grounded in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mira notices weight distribution in footsteps and vibration patterns. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure (whispers growing clearer), with no register drift. Slight convergence in academic/maintenance lexicon during chamber discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "impossible clarity" slightly abstracts sound but saved by electrical hum context. Sentence rhythm accelerates with "surged overhead... resonate," propelling closure. Final line's "meant to be navigated by sound" risks telling but charges the motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of occupational knowledge (maintenance worker) and acoustic physics avoids tropes. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes, but "zodiac coin" borders on familiar motif without deeper transformation beyond the whisper network.</comment>
