<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ansel’s motivation ("store wonder in cellar of reason") feels poetic but abstract; interior contradiction lacks embodied friction beyond the central metaphor. Final renunciation of active time-repair for preservation earns cost through silver-sealed timer, yet emotional progression leans toward tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the silver mirror trained on the future crystallizes the shift from harvesting to preserving echoes, with cost legible in the cavern’s emptied resonance and Ansel’s tailored seconds. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through patterned reflection delays.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s veins constrain choice (measuring echo delays via calipers of shadow) and charge the final image (echoes nesting in stone). Quartz veins and timer mechanism function as micro-setting, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through Ansel’s locksmith perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ansel’s agency—reversing the timer to feed silence—narrowing options from repair to preservation. Cost is conceptual (cavern’s emptied magic) but unmistakable in "reflections pooled, coalescing into a single image of the locksmith as a boy," though escalation lacks visceral urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as harvested echo becomes preserved wonder, with the final image ("house tick, feeling the new seconds fit him like a tailored skin") reweighting the premise without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete actions like sealing the hollow timer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature ("peripherally focused," fractured reflections) with rhythmic control under pressure. Elision (e.g., skipping repair mechanics) is taught early and pays off in the accumulative lens; no head-hopping despite reflective shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "peripherally focused" repetitions dulls immediacy slightly, but prose achieves high density ("calipers of shadow," "percussion craters"). Final line’s "tailored skin" avoids cliché while charging closure; no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time mechanics with echo-harvesting feels inevitable, avoiding trope clichés through specific details like scalloped metal. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "wounded season" edges toward familiar abstraction.</comment>
