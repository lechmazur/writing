<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in Mara’s vow: performer-turned-historian binds truth via lace noose on queen. Kestrel’s rifle-on-pawn square reveals his thawing rehearsal, but his underdeveloped past slightly dilutes their final exchange’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: overlapping footsteps form unreadable word at dawn, cost legible in "gaps only the living could fill." Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory density ("luminous absence") without causal breaks, each whisper compounding stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Whispering gallery’s stone mouths tasting of "iron and lilac" constrains choice (Mara spells history via footsteps) and charges final image. Chessboard’s missing pawns mirror city’s hierarchies, making environment indispensable to closure’s conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara’s walking pattern: "remember" encircling them as moat forecloses silence. Kestrel’s arrival risks violence but escalates via agency (kicking knight, asking for Adel’s name), though patrol’s entrance feels slightly coincidental rather than causally inevitable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mara notices "scullery maid’s trembling fingers," not grand events. Voice modulates under pressure—fragmented rhythms during Kestrel’s approach ("heel-toe-pause-toe-heel")—but "nomadic penumbra" recurs with slight overuse, nudging toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion stumbles in "benevolently ruthless" abstraction; "luminous absence" repetition risks thematic echo. Otherwise impeccable: "stone throats softening consonants" fuses image and action, but scaffolded interiority near climax prevents 8.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: crisis actor turned historian of "small gestures" transforms interregnum tropes. The lace-noosed queen and wingbone alphabet feel inevitable, yet risk-taking (lyric pacing, silence as weapon) heightens stakes without gimmickry—only minor derivativeness in "whispering stones" motif.</comment>
