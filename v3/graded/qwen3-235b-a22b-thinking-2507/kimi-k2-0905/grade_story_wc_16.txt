<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "carefully reckless" duality and restitution speech, but motivation for symphonies' efficacy lacks concrete causality under pressure; micro-choices like leaving ink well reveal value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost: ink well sacrifice and "memory multiplies like birds" crystallize stakes; Accumulative lens holds through textural pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive actively constrains choices (mural forces restitution speech) and charges final image (humming through stone); sensory details like "dust tasting of iron" filter through linguist's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist agency drives escalation from writing to restitution speech; cost legible in ink well sacrifice, but Council threat remains abstract rather than viscerally tested on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (mapping chords to phonemes), not abstraction; final image of ink well "writing new promises" reweights trust as participatory symphony without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "symphonies of truth hidden inside dead alphabets"; rhythmic control under crisis ("Shelves creaked...") avoids syntactic monotony while modulating tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; high-density lines like "memory multiplies like birds startled from a field" serve multiple functions without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics and music transforms tropes; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with specificity in ink-as-vow mechanics.</comment>
