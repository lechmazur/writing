<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's curator identity drives every choice, from tea offerings to the empty cushion display. Contradictory impulses (solve vs. witness) crystallize in her dawn realization about the box not wanting opening. Final renunciation of tools for presence earns thematic cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as the heartbeat merges with dawn sounds—cost legible in the quiet box and transformed courtyard space. Accumulative lens holds perfectly: rumor density tightens to shared silence with conceptual cost (mystery absorbed, not solved).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Courtyard functions as active micro-setting: fountain hushes when Mira listens, tiles cool underfoot, and "space between bodies" physically charges the ending. Rose-gold mosaics and sesame bread avoid postcard clichés by constraining choices (tea sips for rumors).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira’s agency: her shift from active investigation ("borrowed borescope") to passive witness forecloses solving the mystery. Cost is visceral in the locket’s fading pulse merging with dawn—a single deepening that reweights healing as presence, not answers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the empty cushion display and offerings—no moralizing. Final image ("shape of the key we already are") reweights listening as embodied witness, avoiding binaries by showing cost in the absorbed-but-unsolved mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Mira notices objects as vessels ("brass compasses, cracked ouds"). Rhythm modulates from urgent ("rumor riding the desert breeze") to meditative ("sky shifted from plum to peach") without losing concrete anchoring in the locket’s click.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "mosaics still cool underfoot" anchors economy; "lub-dub, slower than clocks" avoids cliché. Minor tell ("she understood then") offset by visceral beats like neighbors settling "into silence the way others settle into pews."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thrift-shop curator as healer, mailbox as heartbeat vessel. Avoids tropes by making the resolution (not opening) the revelation. Emotional truth in the milk tooth offering proving "listening opened a valve."</comment>
