<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority excels through sensory specificity ("sensitively perceptive ears caught older frequencies"), but Mira's transformation lacks contradictory impulses; her acceptance of becoming the corridor feels fated rather than a meaningful choice with visible cost escalation. Legacy burden motivates but isn't tested through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: Mira becoming the corridor reweights legacy's burden with undeniable conceptual cost ("her heartbeat became the echo"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—the density shift from diaries to tunnel negatives reconfigures stakes through sensory accumulation without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tunnel of film negatives functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its physical constraints ("negatives brushing her face") directly enable the reversal glimpses and Mira's dissolution. Climate-shift decay isn't backdrop but active pressure—ivy and dripping corridors literally reshape spatial choices and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mira's agency in following the echo to the tunnel, but the dominant legacy burden stake isn't tested by competing desires—her pursuit lacks friction until the irreversible transformation. Cost is legible ("turning her into a corridor"), yet escalation leans more on atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the film negatives' physical reprise: the final breathing room image reweights "legacy's burden" as inescapable inheritance without moralizing. Mira's dissolution answers the central question—"what walls dream about"—through embodied consequence, not abstraction, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature ("listened to the stone remember footsteps") where rhythm modulates with pressure—lyric cadence tightens as Mira descends. No POV leakage; all description filtered through her acoustic sensitivity, even in surreal moments like the negative-induced age reversals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density ("blackened edges fluttering like moth wings") but minor scaffold appears: "murmurs that predated the flood lines" slightly over-explains atmospheric tension. Final image ("empty room that somehow breathed") avoids figurative muddle, though "legacy's burden" repetition risks thematic echo in diaries.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Synthesizes architectural memory, climate grief, and film technology into an inevitable whole—the corridor-as-camera premise transforms tropes through concrete mechanics (ivy as shutter, storms as flash powder). Risk-taking (Mira's dissolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling earned through prior image logic.</comment>
