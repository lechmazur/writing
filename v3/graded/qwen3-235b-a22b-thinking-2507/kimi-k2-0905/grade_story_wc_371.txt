<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: Mila fears eating bread "might seal amnesia" yet plants it anyway, embodying the tension between preservation and consumption. Micro-choice to wrap it "heuristically gentle" reveals her hierarchy of values—memory over sustenance—with cost in her tears salting ordinary crust at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "absolution stays tenuous only if left unleavened" crystallizes the cost of memory work while reconfiguring options through sprouting herbs. Orientation anchors within 40 words (who/where/when), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure tightens via bread’s transformation from relic to living altar without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: the bread’s fragility ("harsh hands might make miracle reconsider") forces Mila’s gentleness, while breadcrust armor on shoots charges the final image. Palace mosaics evolve causally—dull at start, "brightened" by frost night—mirroring Mila’s internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens: each planted loaf deepens the city’s reclamation, narrowing Mila’s options from passive noticing to active cultivation. Cost is unmistakable in "tears salting the crust" and the gardener’s warning that "tenuous absolution wilts under scrutiny," making the final resilience feel earned through repeated micro-sacrifices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: basil spelling "Pain d’Amande" reweights the opening bakery’s erasure without moralizing. Final line—"cultivating the sacred that was always ordinary"—resonates as a non-literal answer to memory’s fragility, avoiding sentimentality by grounding wisdom in "thyme between cobblestones" and commuters’ lingering glances.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "creeping normality noticer by trade" filters all details through Mila’s vocation, with rhythm shifting from measured ("heuristically gentle") to urgent ("vines parted to reveal"). No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under pressure as "crumbs on her lips" trigger embodied insight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold: "heuristically gentle" appears twice with purpose—first as observation, then as action—showing character growth. Propulsion peaks in closure: "every ordinary doorway possible altar" compresses theme into concrete image. No figurative muddle; even "flour ghosts" serves atmosphere without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: guerrilla gardening as memory reclamation transforms urban decay tropes through breadcrust armor and tea-steam confessions. Risk-taking heightens stakes—the loaf’s warmth risks "sealing amnesia"—while specificity ("seven pieces, each apology") avoids abstraction, making the sacred-in-ordinary feel inevitable.</comment>
