<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "anguished joy" feels diagnostic rather than shown through micro-choices. Strength: credible endurance in veil-to-banner transformation shows earned renunciation of solitary purification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails (unclear setting until para 3), costing -0.4. Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "to purify wasn't to erase but to carry gently" reconfigures memory's cost with conceptual weight in the final lantern image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Saffron veil functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (absorbs sweat, becomes banner) and charges the final image. Weakness: archive remains atmospheric rather than spatially coherent pressure point despite defensive algorithms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the historian's agency in "avoiding patterns," narrowing options until the backward-walking exit. Cost is legible as freckles mapping constellations—memory's beautiful scarring becomes the final image's conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image of "lanterns against the growing dark" offers resonant non-literal answer to memory's purpose, reweighting "purification" through the bronze pagoda's evolution from burden to compass without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("air tasted of copper tears") with rhythmic control, though "steadily unpredictable" diction drifts into abstraction. Lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's earned stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density falters in "screaming equations that begged to be human" (strained metaphor). Template cadence in opening beats ("pressed... feeling... showed") costs -0.4, but closure image remains sharp with zero scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms memory-keeper trope through physics of nostalgia-as-atoms; "walking backward while facing forward" exit is fresh. Avoids safety middle with moral ambiguity in "beautiful contamination of being human."</comment>
