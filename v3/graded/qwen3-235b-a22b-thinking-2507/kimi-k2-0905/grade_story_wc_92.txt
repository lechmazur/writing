<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "cradle of sparks" metaphor made physical; micro-choices (graphite insertion, quill exchange) reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost in Voss confrontation. Flaws: Luce’s minimal presence limits relationship crucible depth despite clean choreography.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "fort stood unlocked in every sense" reconfigures tyranny with conceptual cost ("horizon no longer rented to tyrants"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—blackout pressure tightens through sensory density to revolution’s inevitability. No orientation debt; cost proof evident in banner/gate imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: graphite sliver and quill holder constrain choices (lock-picking, aether bridging), charging the final image where "bronze quill holder catches returning lights." Sensory hierarchy masterful—crisis narrows to graphite’s "sharp enough to rewrite a life" while calm moments admit "bruised violet" sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Garnet’s agency: graphite translation of sundial angles deepens knowledge, forcing trade-off between false reporting and revolution. Cost crystallizes when Voss’s "caution" unwittingly passes "secret heartbeat" to Luce—visible price shaping sky-barge liberation. Single deepening suffices for this lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "we write tomorrow with light" reframes tyranny as "rented" horizon. Final image’s neutral banners reprice power without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "cradle of sparks" evolves from metaphor to generator ignition, charging closure with earned complexity about darkness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is revelatory: "hush that should not have fallen," "moth-wing footsteps." Compression taught early ("rehearsed in dreams") pays off in silent revolution. No head-hopping; Luce’s segment maintains Garnet’s lens. Rhythmic control peaks during lock-picking: "traced the sequence... each number a hushed promise."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "bruised violet" sky and "sparks inside her chest" avoid cliché through concrete action. Single hairline slip: "cradle of sparks" repetition risks overuse but is redeemed by generator ignition. Final image’s "secret smile" lands cleanly—no figurative muddle despite high-pressure stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms lock-picking trope via graphite sliver and aether mechanics. Emotional truth in Garnet’s mask removal—not victory but "last winking hush settle into history." Risk-taking (lyric compression) heightens stakes: "two tongues of the same silent flame" synthesizes revolution’s intimacy and scale without abstraction.</comment>
