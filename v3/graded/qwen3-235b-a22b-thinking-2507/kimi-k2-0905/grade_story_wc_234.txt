<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corin's contradictory impulses (scientific quantification vs. intuitive presence) drive his confession and the pocket-sun crushing, with Mira's "by returning differently" crystallizing earned change through tactile warmth transfer; minor deduction for Mira's motivation lacking equal depth beyond her earth-life eyes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: crushing the light transforms the shell into "shared presence" that "would never need preserving," reconfiguring the entire premise under Accumulative/Textural lens; ember nexus singing and shadows "tying past to future" make conceptual cost visceral and irrefutable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic glass functions as micro-setting that charges the climax—radiating heat under boots early, then "singing" when light spreads—constraining choices by embodying the nexus' warmth Corin nearly commercialized; ember fissures backlight Mira’s silhouette to pressure their secret.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Corin confesses "I've been selling absence," narrowing options to destroy his livelihood; the pocket-sun crushing pays visible cost (contained starfire released) that alters tactics by shifting from preservation to "creating spaces where memory could breathe," all under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image of the transformed shell—carrying "density of shared presence" that "would never need preserving"—resonantly answers "how to capture presence without killing it" without moralizing; avoids Thematic Echo by making concept emerge from concrete action (crushing light) rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scientifically romantic mind" measuring emotion in biomarkers) modulates under stress into poetic compression ("voice cracking like cooling magma"); minor deduction for "stretching elastic as caramel" risking ornamental simile despite later color-spectrum payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops with high propulsion, but "measuring love in milligrams of oxytocin" flirts with diagnostic label-speak—saved by immediate concrete tie to shell’s "mathematics beyond chemistry"; otherwise flawless rhythm variation anchors "volcanic glass sing" climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transcends alchemy tropes by making pocket-suns literal "holes where moments should be"; the nautilus shell’s transformation from "calcified heart" to shared vessel feels inevitable through specific, lived stakes (Guild commercialization, mentor’s dying gift), avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
