<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in ink/thunder scent and 730-orbit counting; embodied emotion in splintered nib's scent release. Lacks contradictory impulses during climax beyond "thirsty for contradiction," slightly flattening the final push.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("The story continues") with undeniable conceptual cost (regret becoming "merely another planet"). Orientation flawless by line 3; drive lens (Hybrid: Accumulative/Causal) holds through elliptical rewriting mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: rosewood nib constrains choice (splintering under pressure) and charges the final image (inked sunrise on window). Observatory's copper dome isn't backdrop but active writing surface, with starlight as tangible medium.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Cordelia's agency: each proof-by-contradiction attempt ("Assume the orbit is eternal") visibly narrows options, culminating in the cage-breaking cost. Stakes shift from abstract regret to physical tool fracture with emotional consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through celestial mechanics: "regret that cannot accommodate new truth is not orbit but cage" reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image of widening orbits offers resonant non-literal answer to truth's mutability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "starlight dripped through the slit roof and pooled on the slate floor"—newsprint heir viewing light as ink. Rhythmic control under pressure ("gears groaned like old editors arguing deadlines") avoids cadence loops.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "silver ink distilled from photographic fixer—every drop held an archived front page" compresses history into texture. Minor deduction for "devotedly observant" repetition approaching synonym churn in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms journalism tropes via celestial cartography: "proof by contradiction" as literal sky-writing feels inevitable. Risk-taking (observatory as truth-reconfiguration space) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing regret as flawed orbit.</comment>
