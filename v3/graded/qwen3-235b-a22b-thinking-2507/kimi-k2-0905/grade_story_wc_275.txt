<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (hunter eyes vs pacifist path) embodied in grafting action; micro-choices like binding scrap with hair reveal values under pressure. Parents' off-page presence limits relationship dynamics despite strong individual motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly when planting the hybrid rose, with visible cost in "pressing deep into healing earth." Orientation clear by para 2; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density, though escalation lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass dome and roses function as micro-setting constraining choice (grafting with canvas scrap) and charging final image ("copper petals like burnished metal"). "Healing earth" specificity elevates beyond generic desert tropes, though "obsidian spire" feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes ("weaving continuity through chaos") deepen through Mira's all-night grafting, narrowing options to transformation. Cost legible in "father's restless spirit finding rest," but escalation could better manifest through environmental pressure rather than internal resolve alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (weaving violence into stems), not moralizing. Final image reweights "tranquil blaze" into resonant answer about unity in destruction, avoiding sentimentality while charging prior blood-bloom observations with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("roses bloomed brighter where blood soaked earth") and rhythmic control under pressure. Single-POV consistency flawless; "burnished copper" near-cliché prevents 9.0 despite otherwise masterful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density in grafting scene risks muddling ("coarse weave resembled lines etched into weathered hands" adjacent to sensory overload). Zero loops but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats prevents higher score despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "bounty hunter's pacifist daughter" trope through horticultural specificity (canvas-weave stems, coral forgiveness petals). Moral ambiguity avoids safety middle, though desert ruin setting lacks fresh inflection beyond premise.</comment>
