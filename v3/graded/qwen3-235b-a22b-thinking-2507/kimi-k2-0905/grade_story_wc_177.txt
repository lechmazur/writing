<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("born without future or past") manifests in embodied micro-choices: sealing palm to bunker, spreading disc over heart. Final walk into storm earns renunciation of continuity with visible cost—melted seal as second skin—though secondary pressure lacks another character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "continuity is letting go" reweights premise with undeniable cost (seal becoming skin). Accumulative lens holds; disorientation taught early ("memory of thunder") pays off in storm's "living weather." Orientation clear by 120 words via vine-draped bunker anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vine-draped bunker constrains every choice: lens-floor floods with lightning, architecture tilts to balance her, walls spell questions. Final image of bunker cracking into seedlings charges closure—environment directly shapes transcendence and "ethereal grit" tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why paths choose walkers) tightens via storm's approach: lens flooding forces wafer seal's transcendence. Cost is visceral (circuits branching like veins), but escalation lacks narrowing options; hunger's "devouring chooser" deepens stakes without altering tactics mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "decay is freedom remembering its first shape" crystallizes from wafer seal's decay and storm's rebirth. Final image (bunker as "vine-draped heart") resonates without moralizing, reweighting "continuity" through the forest's rewilding around her absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "air tastes of rust," "laughter equal parts crystal and rust." Rhythmic control under pressure—"water and light pour in, carrying seeds that sprout before they land"—teaches pattern early. Zero head-hopping; lyric compression paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("metal sweat under green fingers" does triple duty). Final image’s "rain rewrites [name] in shifting syllables" avoids figurative muddle. Minor register drift: "interpreted dreams" slightly abstract in high-pressure dream sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic bunker transformed by "precisely playful" architecture and wafer seal as policy-veins. Risk-taking (conceptual stakes as physical decay) heightens coherence; "hunger sees her back" avoids trope with visceral, earned specificity.</comment>
