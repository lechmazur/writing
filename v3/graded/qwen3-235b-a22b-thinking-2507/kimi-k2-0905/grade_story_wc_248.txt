<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority leans on labels ("pyromania," "analytically intuitive") without sufficient embodied contradiction during pivotal decoding; the arsonist's transformation feels earned but lacks visceral micro-struggle in the archive's climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the archive's collapse and Ember's emergence with the tapestry fragment crystallize irreversible change, with cost legible in her identity shift from "vandalized self-portrait" to truth-keeper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment constrains every key choice, from decoding coordinates to accepting volcanic tenderness as preservation; its warmth and reweaving directly charge the final image of Ember carrying "beacons for others."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten cleanly as Ember overlays her art to decode the message, but the cost remains abstract—physical danger from the collapsing archive isn't embodied in her actions, diluting visceral escalation despite strong agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>"Destroy to save" emerges organically through the tapestry's revelation; the final image of burning "to illuminate rather than consume" reweights destruction without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct ("volcanic tenderness" as recurring motif) but edges toward overwriting in peak beats; "analytically intuitive mind" feels diagnostic rather than character-particular, slightly flattening interior texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Minor redundancy in "volcanic tenderness" repetitions and label-heavy phrasing ("pyromania") in high-pressure beats; otherwise, lyrical density serves momentum without obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms arson tropes through the tapestry's twist—burning as preservation feels inevitable yet fresh, anchored in specific details like chemical compounds in art; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
