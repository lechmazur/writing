<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (duty vs. empathy) manifest in micro-choices: her "slyly heartfelt reverence" while unwinding the chain reveals simultaneous service to both factions. Final compromise earns endurance via adhesive analysis, with cost legible in the "shared pulse" of clasped hands over the chain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: delegations' silent nod crystallizes reconfigured options (cyclical gates), with tangible cost in the "three nights" compromise. Causal lens holds throughout—adhesive impurities directly enable keystone discovery, and the lullaby’s acoustic physics resolves conflict through earned agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s acoustics constrain choice (lullaby modulates speech into harmony) and charge the final image (river "singing the same lullaby"). Sensory hierarchy is impeccable: Mireya’s magnification-goggled focus on adhesive crystalline lattice narrows perception to urgent detail, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mireya’s agency: analyzing adhesive impurities creates a tightening (coordinates to keystone) that forecloses binary solutions. Cost is unmistakable in the moonrise/moonset cycle—a visible trade-off that alters tactics for both factions, reweighting the dominant stake through her causal choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through acoustic physics, not moralizing: the lullaby’s modulation makes farmers "hear ripple of fish tails," offering resonant non-literal answer to conflict. Final image (river singing to stone/soil) reweights prior discord without stating a moral, embracing complexity through embodied consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in technical specificity ("crystalline lattice," "powdered obsidian") and rhythmic control during pressure ("trembled like a tuning fork"). Voice modulates perfectly—clinical precision during analysis shifts to lyrical warmth at closure, with no head-hopping in single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or causality. High-density prose ("silver coins of light that appeared and vanished as the building breathed") avoids figurative muddle. Final line’s "dappled resolve" recharges the moonlight motif with earned conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms volcanic mediation trope through acoustic engineering: "encrypted compassion" becomes literal physics (modulated soundwaves), not abstraction. Fresh inflection in using surveyor’s chain as both measuring tool and symbolic unifier—specific, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable.</comment>
