<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses masterfully embodied: Mira’s drumming externalizes overload while seeking space to "breathe her own dream," culminating in earned endurance teaching harmony. Visible cost in "weary smile" after final heartbeat departs; no diagnostic label-speak despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: auroral veil’s "collaborative color" reconfigures identity with undeniable cost ("weary smile," "released lives"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (splitting seedpods, ghost notes) without causality breaks; orientation anchored by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sound wave garden actively constrains choices: quartz bough enables drumming rebellion, lagoon’s "liquid metal" surface recognizes electrolytes. Final image charged by micro-setting—the auroral veil as "communal exhalation" reshapes the garden’s sonic logic with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Mira’s agency: drumming intensifies → garden amplifies → lagoon immersion forces pulse rebellion. Cost unmistakable—"final foreign heartbeat left her chest" forecloses isolation; "weary smile" proves identity expansion’s toll under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "teaching it harmony" rejects tidy binaries, while final image ("breathed alone and together") offers non-literal answer to identity expansion. No thematic echo; complexity in "tender accountability" avoids false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature aural-centric ("tremolo of crickets," "luminous ripples sang in B-minor"); rhythm mirrors drumming motif. Voice modulates perfectly—lyrical calm to compressed stress ("drummed faster, a glissando")—with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "seedpods became hush-muted cymbals" exemplifies triple-duty density. Figurative language precise ("memory-threads tightened"), climax rhythm varies ("pressed her palms together... began the rhythm"). Closure line recharges motifs without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic memory grafts transform identity tropes. Emotional truth in "tender accountability" realization; specific details (B-minor "auroral sorrow," upside-down planter) avoid abstraction. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
