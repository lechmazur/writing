<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("fingers tremble," "echoes flutter through ribs"); micro-choice to dig at marble lamb over family grave reveals prioritization of ancestral duty. Contradictory impulse slightly muted at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: sealing herself underground with "soft metallic kiss" makes cost undeniable. Causal chain flawless—coin discovery directly enables excavation. Orientation crystal-clear by first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt silo constrains choices (ladder access, starlight decoding) and charges final image (locking door). "Tenderly organized" wheelbarrow enables sovereign case discovery. Micro-setting drives causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock intentions before dawn) escalates via decoding; cost is visceral (sealing underground). Agency pure—no coincidence resolves conflict. "Chess clock toward endgame" tightens time pressure perfectly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "Intentions: hope, defiance, return" seed packets crystallize memory vs. oblivion. Final image (infinite chess clock) reweights premise without moralizing. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless—"velveteen gloom," "clipping ivy" filter through gardener’s eyes. Under stress, syntax shortens ("Letter by letter, the border yields"). Zero register drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs" embodies emotion without cliché. Final line achieves poetic compression ("names she will decode") without muddying causality. Rhythm varies organically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery tropes: "chess clock" reframes time as active pressure, "tenderly organized" as key to unlocking memory. Seed packets labeled "defiance" synthesizes theme through concrete action. Risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
