<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's embodied "protected vulnerability" and trembling hands reveal contradictory impulses under pressure; her pivotal choice to offer truth ("stand here naked") is earned by the brass bell's decoded grief and forecloses the team's lying path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance shift with undeniable cost—their certainty "flapping like a loose sail" and the grief-filled mirror shard—under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens, though "honest wind" slightly over-explains the cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: wind chimes encode doubts that directly constrain Mira's ledger work, and the hollow shard charges the final image as a vessel for unspoken grief, meeting 9+ gate via object-as-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation through Mira's agency narrows options from processing doubt to offering truth, with the cracked bell's "killing something ancient" note forcing the geologist's confrontation; cost legible in their fractured certainty at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from coral as "living cities" versus data points; final image of wind chimes singing "raw music of not knowing" reweights nuance without moralizing, though "protected vulnerability" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt and regret," "moral radiation") and rhythmic control—lyrical in chimes, taut at dawn—show voice modulating under pressure with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops and high density, but "the cloak of doubt she wore wasn't fabric but atmosphere" slightly dilutes immediacy with overwritten metaphor in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "conscience for hire" via wind-chime cipher and hollow shard; the lighthouse's "whispering warnings" feel fresh, not tropey, with emotional specificity in coral as "living cities."</comment>
