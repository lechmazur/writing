<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lack of contradictory impulses in Lyra's pivotal choice; motivation clear but interiority leans toward poetic abstraction over embodied struggle during the key placement. No visible micro-choices revealing value hierarchy under pressure despite strong "quietly deliberate" embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("hearts heavier with weight shed") under Accumulative lens. Orientation flawless; density escalation via brass rings/spoons imagery reweights stakes cleanly. One tightening (winding key backward) sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The automaton key (tool) constrains choice and charges closure (fused as heart valve), but the floating isle setting remains atmospheric rather than pressuring tactics. Sensory details vivid yet lack constraint on Lyra's actions beyond serving as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early; escalation through density increase (stars smearing into spoons) under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable in final image, though Lyra's agency lacks trade-off depth—no palpable tension in her key placement despite conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "spoons bent reality" evolves into "love bent into shape by light" without moralizing. Final line reprices absence as teachable, but "sigil for remembering what absence teaches" edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("star-threaded dome," "moonshadows") with rhythmic control. Minor over-explanation in "hearts heavier" slightly dulls immediacy, but voice modulation under pressure remains exemplary with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multitask ("shadows slipped like silk scarves" conveys motion, metaphor, stakes). One hairline slip: "iris diaphragms widening like memory" uses abstract comparison during high-pressure beat, slightly muddying immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spoon-bending physics with shadow metaphysics. Emotional truth in "hearts heavier" avoids tropes, while risk-taking with conceptual closure (no physical confrontation) heightens stakes without gimmickry or clarity loss.</comment>
