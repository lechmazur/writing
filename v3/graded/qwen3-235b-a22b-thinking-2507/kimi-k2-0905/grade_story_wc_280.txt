<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "need possibility" versus craving applause, with embodied cost ("words tasting of iron curtain weights"). Lila's sudden appearance slightly undermines solitary motivation, though her role as memory-crucible works.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure as Earned Stasis when nostalgia "thickens into almost-solid ground" with visible cost (Lila vanishing, ghost becoming mortal actor). Orientation clear by sentence one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard constrains every choice: quince tree's backward blooming reconfigures time, floral chords interact with echoes. Tarot coin's "forbidden flavor" ties sensory detail to final heartbeat image. No decorative white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: walking the stage produces layered echoes that literally thicken ground underfoot. Cost crystallizes when he becomes "the young actor who had first died for an encore," foreclosing ghostly existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "time is a song" motif; final image of "hidden wing of the theater" reweights despair/possibility without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite "lure possibility" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic diction ("citrine applause, indigo silence") modulates under pressure. Zero register drift; rhythm accelerates with "echoes layered like harmonies" during high-stakes weaving.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "petals returning to bud" shows instead of tells time reversal. Figurative language serves pressure ("footlights long cold" conveys absence). Final line's propulsion ("invisible yet satisfied") is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Trope transformation: ghost isn't spectral cliché but "unraveling memory" stitched by tarot coin. Risk-taking (time as sensory harmony) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors universality in theater-specific details.</comment>
