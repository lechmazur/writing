<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "voice cracking, until his living tongue bled" shows authentic struggle; micro-choice of selecting "forgive" pod reveals value hierarchy with visible cost. Lacks secondary character pressure, but single-POV baseline fully satisfied through action-driven motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when "coral polyps stirred, remembering the shape of peace" reweights war/peace with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout with density increase culminating in the grove's emergence; "narrow vastness" evolution provides legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Jetty roots cracking concrete actively constrain choice by forcing kneeling position; recurring seed pods charge final image as "possibility." Sensory hierarchy ("tasted salt," "drowned trumpet") filtered through coachman's dead-language expertise avoids tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single tightening when seeds "blossomed instantly into vines" narrows options from ritual to irreversible transformation. Cost legible in bleeding tongue and "battlefield exhale," but secondary stake (language sacrifice) could deepen pressure earlier to justify 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Final image of polyps "remembering peace" offers non-literal answer to healing violence without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "metal flowers" becoming "white flowers shaped like outstretched hands" avoids abstraction while charging closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "glyph no scholar alive could pronounce" showing linguistic expertise; rhythmic control peaks with "syllables settled like silt." Zero head-hopping despite gull interaction; compression taught early through coral dust imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "rust-colored feather" reprise carries dual meaning without scaffold. Minor density risk in "hollow bones... barnacled" metaphor cluster, but payoff in treaty echo justifies complexity without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reef death/battlefield healing through linguistic archaeology. "Seeds older than violence" transforms war tropes via specific seed-pod ritual; emotional truth in coachman's physical sacrifice avoids abstract pacifism.</comment>
