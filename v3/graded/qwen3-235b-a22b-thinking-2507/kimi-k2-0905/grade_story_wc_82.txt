<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "grief is only another kind of flame" micro-choice and rib-cracking ritual, but daughter's absence limits relationship crucible; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak yet "luminous torment" borders on abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise when cranes become "living lanterns that would glow each night," reconfiguring grief with visible cost in crumbling moonstone and tea-scented hands; accumulative lens holds through sensory density without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: moonstone polishing method (seven strokes ritual) directly constrains the transformation attempt and charges the final image; "stealing" tea leaf as fuel demonstrates lived-in environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (transforming grief) tightens through moonstone cracking during ritual, narrowing options to origami as sole conduit; cost legible in "ribs glowed from within" and eyes gaining "luminous torment," though "descends while ascending" trait lacks active constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing via final image "light shaped like goodbye," reweighting grief as communal fuel; thematic resonance emerges from concrete crane ritual but secondary ambiguity about dream-engine ethics remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in lantern-maker noticing fuel in dreams ("grief is only another kind of flame"); rhythmic control under pressure ("one became seven, seven became forty-nine") with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pocket of silence" and "sugar prayers" exemplify high-density phrasing; final line "hands smelled only of tea" perfectly recharges opening kerosene motif without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of origami grief ritual with dream-recording tech avoids sentimentality; "shadow detaches from heels" opening and antiseptic-lavender dust transform universal loss through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
