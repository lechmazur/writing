<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority shines through embodied contradictions—lithium withdrawal’s sensory overload versus mental clarity—and micro-choices like aligning bellows with forearm compass reveal her value hierarchy. Flaws drive action (plagiarism guilt), but "sin" abstractions slightly undermine concrete particularity at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the accordion’s disappearance reconfigures forgiveness as "bearing," with visible cost in "tears diluted the lithium residue." Orientation anchors instantly ("ivory-choked platform"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through rhythmic density escalation to the stream’s release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The disused station actively constrains choices—ivy-filtered light, loosened plank revealing stairs—while the accordion bellows (micro-setting) charges closure as water flows through it, "cleaning out dust." Final "ivy rustling, leaves applauding" ties environment to earned thematic weight without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through one meaningful deepening: graffiti wisdom leads to the stream, where Lila’s agency (reciting coordinates as apology) forces trade-offs with visceral cost ("cold bit, but she stayed"). "Raw solace" payoff reweights lithium withdrawal setup, though "sin" abstraction slightly dilutes tangible stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically—"water remembers what banks forget" evolves from graffiti to guiding principle—without moralizing. Final image (map against heart) answers the forgiveness question through action, though "not a destination but a bearing" borders on slight direct statement, avoiding sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct ("river inside her mind," "map fluttering like a white flag"), with rhythm modulating to her state (short phrases during descent). Controlled first-person avoids therapy-speak, though "sin" abstraction briefly breaks POV plausibility mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-flawless propulsion: "pried up a loosened platform plank, revealing iron stairs spiraling into darkness" layers action and revelation. Zero loops, but "every scrawled coordinate... corresponded to a sin" feels overwrought for peak pressure, slightly muddling clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "self-forgiveness journey" through river chronicler specificity—the accordion-as-conscience device avoids tropey sentimentality. Emotional truth anchors "funeral she skipped," though "sin" abstraction reduces particularity, preventing 9.5+ despite bold structural risk.</comment>
