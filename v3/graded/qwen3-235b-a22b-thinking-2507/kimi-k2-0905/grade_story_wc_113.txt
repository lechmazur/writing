<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Musician's liminal existence drives choices with embodied contradiction ("trapped between spaces"), but ghost's backstory revelation lacks sufficient friction—betrayal feels narratively convenient rather than earned through prior causal pressure in the compact frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when he plays "the music that existed in the spaces between," crystallizing the cost of disrupting silence; water recession slightly edges toward coincidence but is outweighed by the final image's conceptual cost reweighting artistic invisibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Flooded opera house actively constrains every choice—water parts for him, lanterns cast "dancing shadows" mirroring emotional state, floating costumes supply the hidden door's location; the violin case's water-soluble ink directly charges the closure image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency as each water-damaged page forces deeper descent; the final choice to play disruptive music carries visceral cost (career suicide), with "silence between notes" evolving from observation to moral imperative under Accumulative/Textural pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—water-damaged pages transforming into fish/sheet music—not abstraction; the dawn performance offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "unsung" artistry without moralizing, reweighting the entire premise via the violin case's dissolving ink.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("splintered podium," "velvet curtain"), but "liminal existence" momentarily slips into academic diction; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure with no head-hopping, though ghost's silent communication risks over-idealization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "musical notes transformed into fish" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Mild deduction for "transformed into something new" repetition in final beats, slightly muddying the closure's conceptual clarity without breaking it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Water-damage communication device transforms stock ghost tropes through specific acoustic logic; "spaces between notes" synthesis feels inevitable. Lacks one fresh inflection—flooded opera house premise echoes known works without sufficient radical reconfiguration beyond the musician's POV.</comment>
