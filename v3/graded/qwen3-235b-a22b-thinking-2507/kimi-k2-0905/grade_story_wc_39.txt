<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in hoarding jars while believing memory "should never be for sale," but secondary character (child) appears too late to develop relationship pressure; final choice earned yet limited by sparse interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: holographic "We are still becoming" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost ("pennies never currency but invitations"), orientation solid by line 3, Accumulative lens held through layered sound collection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dunes and shipwreck function as micro-setting: constrains sound-capturing tactics and charges closure as "curved ceiling" for holograms; "apricot salt" air filters through Posy’s sensory priority during pivotal child encounter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when child’s request forces Posy to act despite lacking recording; agency-driven escalation through jar-emptying sequence, cost legible in "throat tightened" to "weightless" shift, no coincidence resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids thematic echo; "We are still becoming" projection reweights premise as active bridge-building without moralizing, earned through concrete jar sequences rather than abstract reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gulls preached to sand," "apricot salt" air) modulates under pressure, though "holographic letters" slightly jars lexicon; consistent psychic distance with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "bones humming with lonesome splendor" slightly over-embellished but compensated by rhythmic propulsion in closure sequence; final line avoids cliché through concrete "copper seeds" imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sound-jars transform memory tropes through specific mechanics (corking sighs), "pennies as invitations" reconfiguration feels inevitable, avoids safety-middle via bold conceptual closure.</comment>
