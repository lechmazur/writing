<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s numbness versus stirring hope and Zero’s detachment cracking at "fear of love"; synthesis earned by prior confessions with cost in dissolved selves. Zero’s emotional arc slightly less developed mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise (synthesis amid rewrite wave) reconfigures options with undeniable conceptual cost—"footprints fading" charges erasure. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through confession rounds narrowing emotional isolation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating dojo dissolving when purpose completes charges final image; "tasting color" recurrence constrains choices. Slight vagueness in nutrient fluid’s mechanics prevents 9.0 despite strong micro-setting use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ritual rounds where each confession narrows emotional isolation; custody battle’s cost crystallizes in dissolving selves. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens with visceral cost in "grief for selves lost."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "tasting color/silence" recurrence and synthesis paradox; final image reweights erasure as generative heat without moralizing. Child’s laughter avoids sentimentality while answering "holding opposites" question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice distinct in Mara’s sensory focus ("tasting color") versus Zero’s austerity; psychic distance shifts clean during confessions. Slight convergence in final dialogue reduces distinctness but reads intentional for synthesis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops in high-pressure beats; "tasting color" recurrence is purposeful pattern. Minor scaffold in "history crashed over them like a wave" slightly dulls closure immediacy despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cloning tropes via emotional vivification ritual; "brain in jar" transformed from relic to catalyst. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—erasure becomes generative.</comment>
