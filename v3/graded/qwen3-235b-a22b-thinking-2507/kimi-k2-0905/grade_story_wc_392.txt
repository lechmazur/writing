<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara’s "watchfully calm" gait versus trembling hands upon journal discovery; micro-choices like counting steps as breaths reveal value hierarchy. Final renunciation of suicide as path earns closure but father’s absence from victim lists feels undermotivated, slightly fracturing causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands impeccably: Mara’s walk back crystallizes options with visible cost (trembling hands, altered tunnel perception). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through tally marks → journal → realization. "Breaking free... only courage to speak" reconfigures stakes without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lantern functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (guiding memories toward truth) and constrains choices (lighting alcove discovery). Sensory hierarchy excels: damp chill versus brass warmth during trauma, drought’s "brittle" earth shaping perception. Tunnel’s concrete throat metaphor avoids cliché through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via journal discovery deepens knowledge (threats against families), narrowing Mara’s options to truth-telling or complicity. Cost is unmistakable: "hands trembled with recognition" as drought trauma merges with personal history. Single tightening suffices, though "reverberate" phrase’s dominance could heighten earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "water remembers" etched in concrete, not moralizing. Final lantern image reweights drought as shared burden, not individual guilt. Avoids thematic echo by having Mara’s realization ("breaking free...") dramatized through action, not declaration. No forced binaries; commissioner’s victims remain morally complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "numbers felt hollow, like bones picked clean" and tunnel-as-throat metaphor. Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during memory flashback ("The memory hit like a train") contrast with measured cadence in reflection. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical ("empirical observation") to visceral ("entangled faster").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose propulsion excels: "She moved with the watchfully calm gait of someone who had seen too many endings" compresses backstory into active rhythm. Near-zero loops; only minor density dip in "empirical observation becoming tactile" adjacent to later "empirical observations." Final line’s semicolon slightly over-engineers closure’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drought-as-weapon reframes systemic corruption through personal trauma. Lantern’s dual symbolism (freedom/history) avoids trope by charging Mara’s final choice. Emotional specificity in "father’s silence during dinner" transcends template. Risks lyrical compression but maintains coherence; drought’s "cracked earth" refrain deepens without gimmickry.</comment>
