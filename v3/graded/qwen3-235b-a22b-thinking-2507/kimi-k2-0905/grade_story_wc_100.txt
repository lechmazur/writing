<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("inadvertently stubborn" vs. weary resignation) drives choices; micro-choices like tearing pages reveal hierarchy of values with salt-compacted pages as embodied cost. Final renunciation of self-burial earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the undertaker’s eternal tenure crystallizes with visible cost (his name in the book), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3; "maternal click" fracture-to-repair arc lands conceptual cost without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Underwater library constrains every choice (brass octopus catalog, salt pages as fuel); cracked dome recharges final image. Micro-setting (lens shard’s glow) guides navigation, making environment indispensable to tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via protagonist agency: tearing pages into boats creates irreversible cost (sacrificing memory) that alters tactics. Dominant stake (revitalizing signals) tightens through his choices, with visible price in the cold fire’s memory consumption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "rest has a permanent address" resonates via coral circulation desk and returned souls, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "unfinished stories" with conceptual cost of eternal caretaking, no abstract assertions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: undertaker notices fogged glass "like dead eyes," salt on lips as dream residue. Rhythmic control under pressure ("column of chased stillness" modulating from package’s wax seal) with zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "underwater conflagration that burned cold, feeding on memory" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final line’s rhythm ("beacon that burns backward into hearts") recharges prior motifs with propulsion, no scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through undertaker’s occupational lens; "drowned address of rest" synthesizes death/rest/library into non-obvious whole. Risk-taking (underwater library) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with emotional specificity in "salt on lips" detail.</comment>
