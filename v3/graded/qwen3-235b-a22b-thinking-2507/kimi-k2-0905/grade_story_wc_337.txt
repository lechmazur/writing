<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian's embodied motivation—"to give voices back to those who'd lost them"—emerges through concrete micro-choices (unraveling knots, trusting touch over speech) with visible cost in the lifted silence. Fisherman's confession crystallizes the interlaced hush without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian's "maps" realization reconfigures masks' fractures with undeniable conceptual cost (silence lifting, heartbeat returning). Accumulative lens holds through knot-by-knot unraveling, with the net's transformation charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary's refracted light actively constrains choices (painting Elian's face "like war paint") and charges the final image (fox mask fractures as "maps" of light). Net's physicality—knots as "small mouths swallowing sound"—shapes every tactical decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elian's agency: each knot undone narrows options by releasing stories that "might remain whole," with cost legible in the "rising tide" of silence. Fisherman's confession ("drowning in what I never said") crystallizes the accumulative pressure under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through net unraveling into stories—not moralizing—culminating in the resonant final image: fractures as "maps" ready to "let the light through." Avoids tidy binaries by showing silence as both burden and necessary vessel for voices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in sensory selectivity: Elian notices "fracture lines like fault lines" and "sigh that tasted of salt," not generic details. Voice modulates under pressure—"fingers learning the net's language"—with zero head-hopping despite dual presence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "silence pooled around his feet like rising tide water" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("tapestry needle threaded with moonlight") avoids muddle by grounding in concrete action during high-pressure unraveling beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms spirit-rescue trope through specific net-unraveling method and "interlaced hush" physics. Fresh inflection: masks break from "weight of all that unsaid," making restoration about voice-reclamation. Avoids safety-middle with morally ambiguous silence-as-necessity.</comment>
