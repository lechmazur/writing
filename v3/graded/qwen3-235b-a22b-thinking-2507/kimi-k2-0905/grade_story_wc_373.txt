<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("wanted him to stop me... so trust could survive") embodies the core conflict flawlessly; the fob's physical pressure against her palm concretizes abstract betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love"); Accumulative lens holds through the cylinder’s recording of silence, though the father’s absence risks situational convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pier’s sinking tide physically constrains choices while charging the final image; the fob’s "tail digging half-moons" transforms object into embodied setting that shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through atmospheric pressure (rising tide, phantom truck sounds), but the tightening lacks a visible tactical shift beyond emotional cost; the "comforting unease" evolution narrowly fulfills escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fob’s transactional symbolism—"trust breaking" as a sound to be captured—avoiding moralizing, though "weight I had mistaken for love" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid night," "false starts of courage") with rhythmic compression under stress; the phonograph’s "black moon" horn crystallizes voice without overwriting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "tremor of my heartbeat" flirts with bodily cliché; "comforting unease" repetition risks ornamentation yet serves the Accumulative lens’s pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate-market lyricism with emotional archaeology; the fob’s transformation from heirloom to trade good reconfigures trust as a commodified sound, avoiding genre tropes.</comment>
