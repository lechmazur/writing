<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction absent; Calla’s mission-driven focus lacks embodied struggle beyond tactical choices. Micro-choices (skipping beats) serve plot mechanics, not conflicting values. "Tasted of iron and apricot" shows sensory specificity but no sustained internal tension under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: statues rooting as trees and bridge dissolving into dawn reconfigure the orchard’s meaning. Orientation test passed by line 3 ("moon-gray towers," "bronze guardians"). Accumulative lens holds as sensory density (reversed blossoms, molting shell) reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices: glass bridge parts for seed uprooting, gravity-reversing blossoms enable escape. Locust shell’s vein-cable match is micro-setting that charges closure via gold-dust dissolution. Final "ribbon of dawn" image embodies the environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Calla’s agency (backward lullaby, heartbeat signal) narrows options as statues hesitate. But "gap between knowing" timeframe remains abstract thematic framing, not a live clock tightening tactics. Cost legible in "statues rooted themselves," yet stakes lack visceral testing until climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "fruit tasting faintly of escape" answers central question without moralizing. "Tarnished wonder" tone crystallizes in final image of gold-dust seed humming "resonantly soft." Avoids Thematic Echo despite poetic density; resonance built from "apricot scent" rumors and reversed gravity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bow tasting dusk air," "hammock strung between stars") falters slightly in final paragraph with academic phrasing ("language of shimmer"). No head-hopping, but rhythmic control under pressure loses consistency in climax beats, missing 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resonantly soft" repetition serves accumulation but risks overwriting in final beat ("resonantly soft thud"). Information density peaks with "blossoms became tiny lanterns" – concrete propulsion without muddle. Final image retains crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specificity: mechanical guardians crack into "something almost like a smile," beauty "travels on its own legs, even if those legs are only remembered wings." Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "fruit tasting faintly of escape" avoids middle-ground hedging.</comment>
