<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through rosin-ink alchemy and copyist discipline; the solstice transmission choice earns visible cost via inspectors' ash-shedding uniforms, though secondary pressure from Ministry remains off-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: inspectors mouthing burned words reconfigures narrative power; the dial’s afterglow spinning tales fulfills Accumulative lens escalation through dust’s vibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ember alcove’s mist and rosin dust constrain choices (transmitting via copper filament antennae) and charge the final image—inspectors inhaling chord—making micro-setting indispensable for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mila’s agency: weaving antennae for solstice transmission forecloses passive copying; the inspectors’ visceral ash-shedding shows undeniable cost, though Ministry pressure lacks on-page escalation beyond sweeps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rosin-dust alchemy: "dust retelling the famine" reweights storytelling as embodied vibration without moralizing; final image of streets "tasting of rosin" offers resonant non-literal answer to narrative starvation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "phosphor-painted fingers" and "mist tasting of iron"; rhythm modulates from hushed copying to solstice’s airborne score, with no head-hopping despite multi-POV inspectors at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops in peak beats; "copper filament through orchestra pit" shows concrete action, but "thistled calm" feels ornamental (−0.2). Final line’s "parchment of the air" avoids purple prose with purposeful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of musical notation as resistance transforms dystopian trope; dust’s vibrational storytelling feels inevitable through rosin-ink logic, with bold risk in solstice’s airborne transmission heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
