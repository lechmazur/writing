<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("staying while leaving") and embodied empathy ("tasting latent emotions") power micro-choices; Vale's underdevelopment slightly weakens relationship crucible despite strong final bow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost ("surrendering the future"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup to vanishing act where invitation "drank its writer whole."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library's "chained grimoires" and "mirrored desk" constrain choices, charging final image; "enlarged tranquility" evolves from atmosphere to embodied cost in Elara's diffusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via midnight purge deadline; "bring the gift of absence" deepens from poetic filler to perilous cost, narrowing options to surrender or death with visible forfeiture of future.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final image reweights "mistake" as wisdom through absence-as-guardianship; avoids moralizing by showing "tyrants toward mercy" nudges via dust-mote subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tasting emotions," "rustling like trapped moth") sustains under pressure; "enlarged tranquility" refrain modulates rhythm without cadence loops.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "vanish into benevolent hush" crystallizes density. Minor register drift in "latent emotions" (para 4) barely escapes overwriting penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "hush" as active guardianship transforms recluse trope; risk-taking in diffuse consciousness heightens stakes without gimmickry ("unseen hand that reshelves chaos").</comment>
