<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arin's motivation (preserving wonder's pigment) intensifies credibly, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; "insatiably creative" remains label-only without visible struggle cost. Final renunciation (sharing vs hoarding) is earned by the loom's collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Arin's decision to fling droplets reconfigures stakes with felt cost (aging, loom collapse). Orientation anchors by word 20; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through "radiant hush" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Waterfall mist and willow loom constrain choices (weaving seed-knots), charging the final sapling image. "Moss became emerald flame" exemplifies POV-filtered specificity, though "verdant parapet" lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Arin's agency: capturing essence tightens options until the loom buckles. Cost is unmistakable (aging, collapsed loom), but the "weave tugged back" escalation borders on coincidence without deeper causal chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "preserving by sharing" resonates via droplets settling on hands/rooftops. Avoids moralizing; final image ("leaves chiming like quiet bells") answers central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("color of wonder bleeding through weave") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor register drift: "insatiably creative mind" violates Arin's embodied POV; no dialogue present to test voice distinction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "coral, indigo, gold—swirling" exemplifies rhythmic propulsion. Deduct 0.1 for mixed metaphor ("water’s veil shimmered like a loom" later literalized) muddling closure beat coherence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes eco-magic tropes through specific, lived details (equinox dew vials, willow root-drinking). Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes; "sapling roots half in soil, half in dream" transforms cliché with conceptual cost.</comment>
