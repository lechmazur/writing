<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in concrete actions (counting ribbon knots, pressing hair to ear-hole), but the pivotal mirror-cut lacks visible contradictory impulses—her surrender of name feels inevitable rather than wrestled with, weakening micro-choice complexity at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the scar’s vibration reconfigures "freedom" with conceptual cost (name surrender), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the corridor’s year-erasure deepening stakes without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice decisively: the ear-shaped keyhole demands non-verbal confession, and the ribbon/hair’s evolution into a throat scar directly charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—the corridor walk reweights stakes through "moments chosen safety over speech," with the scar’s hum making cost unmistakable, though "unassumingly bold" trait lacks tangible tradeoffs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scar’s vibration ("freedom is not silence but chosen noise"), offering a resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing despite the locksmith’s declarative line, as constellations visually reconfigure Vega’s meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("hint arrived not as word but as temperature"), with rhythmic control under pressure ("tiny, brave, unassumingly bold lanterns"); no head-hopping, though "luminous cub" risks stock metaphor before the muzzle detail anchors it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tremor of improbable longing" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline metaphor ("pecking at bone") but no closure muddle—the ink-flood’s visceral clarity overrides minor overwriting in a single beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Synthesizes "freeing ideas" trope through specific mechanics (ear-lock, hair-passport, ink-flood), with planted stars as bold risk that heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth avoids abstraction via the throat scar’s hum.</comment>
