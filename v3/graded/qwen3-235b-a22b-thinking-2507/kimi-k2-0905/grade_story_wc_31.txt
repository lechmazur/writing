<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in sensory pursuit ("discover the color of sound in the hiss") avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (duty vs. revelation) culminate in earned transformation where Jin realizes sound "waited to paint him into its spectrum," with visible cost in his altered perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens: Jin’s surface emergence with plankton "comet tail" crystallizes the cost—his entire sensory framework rewired—while the final image of singing pier lights reconfigures the opening ritual with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken galleon’s micro-setting constrains every choice (tilting deck, air pockets, bolted books), directly charging the final image where Jin’s transformed lanterns burn "with a different tint," proving environment shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Jin’s agency under Accumulative lens: diving into the wreck narrows options to breath management, with visceral cost in the "delicate archive" collapse risk; the cylinder’s revelation reweights stakes from personal quest to universal truth about sound as light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—vows as bioluminescent plankton, sound as color—not abstraction; the final image ("pier lights sang... in colors they could almost hear") delivers a resonant, non-literal answer to "can sound have color?" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper echo," "velvet" meteor hush) persists under pressure; rhythmic control shifts underwater with fragmented clauses ("air pockets shimmered between beams"), while patterned elision (woman’s disappearance) is taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "pressed lily drifted out, its petals still whispering" compresses action/image/theme; one paraphrase loop ("hiding behind truth" verbatim repeat) slightly dulls momentum in mid-beat but avoids closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific sensory logic: "sound as color" premise gains freshness via Jin’s lamplighter vocation, avoiding abstraction; the sunken library’s rules (breath-dependent archive) commit fully to the concept without retreat.</comment>
