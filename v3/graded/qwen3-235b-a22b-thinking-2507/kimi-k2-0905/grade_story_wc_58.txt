<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when thread reveals it's "extracted presence," compelling her to unmake patterns. Epiphany about writing her own obituary feels earned through tactile choices like winding thread, though "lonesome splendor" slightly edges toward thematic echo in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: garden paths spelling the traveler's transformed understanding crystallizes the Accumulative lens with conceptual cost (her seven years of absence now lightened). Orientation anchors immediately in "shadowed garden" and "after last ship sailed," teaching the pattern early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Autumn garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—dried fountain provides soil for writing names, leaf patterns mirror obituary words—charging the final image where paths spell her realization. Slight deduction as "shadowed garden" lacks granular specificity like soil texture or plant varieties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens as thread shortens: each unwound inch transforms into a projected client, narrowing options until only her own absence remains. Her winding action directly drives the deepening where "geography of healing" shifts from place to process, with felt cost in her aching joints and empty notebook.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—thread becoming "extracted presence," leaves spelling words—not abstract statement. Final line "lonesomely, splendidly lived" resonates as earned subtext after Mrs. Chen dancing and Elsie running, avoiding moralizing while reweighting "explained absences" as unrecognized presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "ink-stained fingers trembling," light "filtering like pale fingers," and "bones dissolved invisibly" reflect the traveler's obituary craft. Rhythmic control heightens pressure during thread-winding ("faces emerged... names in dirt"), though "lonesome splendor" slightly echoes prompt phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "she understood suddenly that it wasn’t thread at all" advance image and theme simultaneously. Minor deduction for "vividly descriptive prose" (Q9D) being generic label rather than showing craft, and "lonesome splendor" bordering on thematic echo in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "obituary writer" trope through specific mechanics: weft thread as collected absences, healing as "carrying absence until light enough to release." Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off with the garden's autumn work spelling new stories, though "geography of healing" feels slightly prompted.</comment>
