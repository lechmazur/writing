<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (voice/safety tension) embodied through bolt ritual; micro-choices like tracing discoloration reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Final endurance lacks sufficient visible cost escalation in the ward scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("ledger of safety" image); Accumulative/Textural lens holds from "snow erasing footprints" to bolt-roll promise. Orientation clear by 40 words; disorientation serves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress constrains choice (sound-absorbing walls enable silence decree); piano bolt charges final image. "Frostbitten hope" crystallizing on lashes exemplifies environment-body-object fusion shaping tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cost of voiceless safety) tightens via boy's surgery; pressure grows through nerve-regeneration whine to bolt-transfer. Agency in "remain" action forecloses speech path, but conceptual cost outweighs felt physical stakes in escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt's evolution from anchor to potential note; "snowflake added to drift" reweights safety without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but final "price of every voice" leans toward abstraction in last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tasting metal and old songs") persists under stress; syntactic compression in "pulse fluttering like trapped bird" shows rhythmic control. Zero head-hopping despite multi-character scene; POV modesty flawless.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "meltwater constellations" exemplifies textural specificity. Slight register drift in "nerve regeneration" (clinical term in poetic context) prevents 9.5, but never obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" synthesizes silence/safety tropes through concrete bolt ritual; cobalt fortress transforms generic siege setting. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "seraphically mundane" borders on ornamental.</comment>
