<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "agreed upon lies" ritual and narrator's quiet acceptance of becoming linguist; embodied emotion via warm seal and limestone's "stay" avoids label-speak; final choice earned through prior micro-choices like pressing seal to gargoyle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands cleanly: narrator inheriting "weight of every story" with conceptual cost in tutor's vanishing; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shift as meteors spell "conjugations," reweighting stakes with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rooftop garden actively pressures choices as burden "like ill-fitting crown"; antique seal constrains action (pressing to gargoyle) and charges final "stay" image; sensory details like "steam rose like incense" reflect urgency through tactile, lived-in navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (loneliness vs connection through "agreed upon lies") signaled by line 4; deepening via tutor's revelation "never been alive" narrows options to inheriting role; conceptual cost legible in vanishing "edges first" and weight of untold stories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "buildings remember in stress fractures," "renovation a polite erasure"; final image "always borrowing, always returning, always home" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; avoids thematic echo via gargoyle's "Welcome, new linguist."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "meteors fell in perfect Latin hexameter" and "stone grinding like drawer"; rhythmic control modulates under pressure (vanishing described as "old varnish lifts"); no head-hopping, psychic distance shifts intentionally with steam spelling "stay."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies pressure (e.g., "brass left faint waxy imprint" advancing plot/character/atmosphere); final "always borrowing... home" resolves with recharged motif; no figurative muddle even in high-density beats like meteors spelling conjugations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sentient architecture ("buildings remember in stress fractures") and linguistic ritual; transforms tropes through specific logic where "agreed upon lies" become structural necessity; risk-taking (lyric Accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s emotional charge.</comment>
