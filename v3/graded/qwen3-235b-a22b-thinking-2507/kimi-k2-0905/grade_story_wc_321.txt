<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arden's contradictory impulses (hope/resignation) act simultaneously in scene; final choice to merge timelines earns through prior causality with visible cost (burning hand, dissolved hourglass). Mother's off-page death slightly unanchored but doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: ferry becomes "entire" only after Arden sacrifices the hourglass, its "glass dust" settling like "frost that chose to stay." Orientation flawless by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Spectral grotto's "interconnected patterns" directly constrain steering choices, while the hourglass (micro-setting object) charges the final image as "brass caps" carrying "saved possibilities." Environment actively shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Arden's agency: radio heartbeats dictate steering maneuvers that solidify the ferry, narrowing options as grotto closes. Cost unmistakable—"hourglass grow warm, then hot, burning hope through his coat"—driving the irreversible merge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "permanent transient" reweights to "another ferry ride between what was and what still could be" without moralizing. Final image of humming deckhand offers resonant non-literal answer to "what is home?"</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("moon dripped like melting silver," clocks running "sideways") modulates under stress: steering sequence compresses to rhythmic fragments ("hard port for two beats") without losing specificity or voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phantom espresso" and "Morse of lives" exemplify high-density propulsion. Final line’s "world decided to slip again" pays off opening with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "vanishing ferry" trope through specific physics (hull "flickered, starboard rail translucent") and emotional truth. Risk-taking heightens stakes: "interconnected patterns" method feels inevitable, not gimmicky, through barnacle coordinates and heartbeat rhythms.</comment>
