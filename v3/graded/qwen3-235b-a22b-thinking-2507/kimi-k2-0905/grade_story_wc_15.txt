<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interiority is poetic but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation ("sew broken precedents open") remains abstract despite embodied actions like bleeding. Final choice feels earned through ritual, but emotional progression lacks layered irrationality under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with undeniable conceptual cost: "plate dissolved, ink becoming rainwater" legibly pays the price of renewal. Orientation is anchored by 78 words, and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts to the final water-stitching hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Red canyon walls function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—path crumbles force cavern entry, shifting walls grant new passages. Final image of "water stitch[ing] stone to sky" charges the environment with irreversible change, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("carve path from ruin to reverence") remains abstract despite lyrical execution; pressure intensifies via sensory accumulation but lacks visceral narrowing of options. Bleeding optimistically deepens commitment yet avoids tangible trade-offs, muting escalation’s cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through woven motifs ("every unraveling is only the first half of a weave") without moralizing. Final line "May what was unmade remember its name" offers resonant non-literal answer, though "hauntingly optimistic" label slightly undermines earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "orchid solace—sweet, funereal" but "hauntingly optimistic" appears as diagnostic label twice, disrupting voice coherence under peak stress. Rhythmic control falters when abstract traits override character-particular diction during bleeding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; sentences like "threads crawling up the walls like ivy of light" achieve high density without muddle. "Flaking into his skin like pollen" risks cliché but gains freshness through precise context, avoiding overwriting penalties in critical beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "poetic wharf weaver" and labyrinth-weaving avoids tropes through concrete stakes (kelp-knotted loom, bleeding on porcelain). Transformation test passes—story collapses without canyon’s physical memory—but "broken precedents" concept leans academic.</comment>
