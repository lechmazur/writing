<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s contradictory impulses (gentle rebellion vs. blood sacrifice) drive every choice; micro-choices like pruning while humming earn her final resolve. Interiority avoids labels—“tasted the memory of every gardener”—with embodied stakes in the blood-feeding moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: transformed greenhouse and disarmed officers with seeds embody cost. Causal lens holds through celestial alignment pressure; the “aftertaste” and plum seeds crystallize irreversible change with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse constrains every choice (kneeling in rust flakes, ash-fertilizer mixture) and charges the final image—copper bones polished by vines. Micro-setting (mother’s plate) directly shapes the harvest’s emotional weight without ornamental detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under celestial countdown (“seven breaths away”), narrowing options to one decisive planting. Marisol’s agency drives escalation—pruning releases scents that rewire synapses—culminating in visible cost: blood sacrifice and Ministry’s hollow arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (synaptic plasticity as rebellion), not abstraction. Final image of officers with plum seeds reweights “treason” as inheritance, avoiding moralizing while charging the central question: memory as collective resistance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“tasted of old rain,” “volatile molecules”) modulates under pressure. Minor deduction for one elevated phrase (“volatile molecules that drifted”) clashing with Marisol’s culinary lexicon during high-stakes pruning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with propulsion, but paraphrase loops in sensory lists (“birthday cakes, first kisses, grandmothers’ kitchens”) dilute tension. Final line (“pockets full of plum-colored seeds”) resonates cleanly despite mid-beat scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of culinary magic realism with political resistance—flavor as rebellion weapon. Risk-taking (synaptic plasticity mechanics) heightens stakes coherently; the “plum-colored seeds” payoff feels inevitable through prior particulars.</comment>
