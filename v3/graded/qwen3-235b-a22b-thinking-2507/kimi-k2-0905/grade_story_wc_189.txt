<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in fleeing yet seeking connection; "thumb brushing cool stone wings" embodies micro-choice with visible cost. Daughter's hesitation and shadow merging reveal relationship dynamics without dialogue. Slight abstraction in "foresee reconciliation" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "conversation resumed without words" crystallizes options with salt-grit cost. Orientation clear by word 20; tide's return erasing footprints yet changing stone proves felt cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held perfectly through silt metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grotto functions as active micro-setting: brittle star crawling over mussel directly mirrors emotional navigation, constraining choices. Tide reclaiming basin charges final image with "stone changed by weight." Phosphorescent ribs slightly ornamental but redeemed by tidal pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation within tidal pause) tightens through daughter's arrival and cicada transfer. Agency entirely protagonist-driven: shifting lantern invites connection, "silt, layering" admission shows earned shift. Cost legible in salt grit and erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "texture of time" as lived experience, not abstraction. Final "tidal conversation" reweights time without moralizing; "cocoon" metaphor earned by cicada motif. Zero thematic echo despite high concept density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "anemone folded like tiny green heart" and drop-as-syllable rhythm. Voice modulates under pressure (brittle star scene). Minor POV breach in "lesson inherited" prevents 9.5 despite masterful lyric compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; "cocoon" metaphor lands perfectly. One scaffold ("behind her, footsteps—soft, hesitant") prevents 9.0. Syntactic variety supports rhythm, though "pocketed... warmer than skin" slightly over-precise for voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms reconciliation trope through tidal mechanics: "pause as breathing creature" feels inevitable. Avoids abstraction via grotto specifics; emotional truth in "awkward jokes" reweaving. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
