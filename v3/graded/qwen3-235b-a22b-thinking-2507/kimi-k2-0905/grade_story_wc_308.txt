<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; transformation occurs without visible struggle or embodied cost during pivotal merging of arrowhead with sternum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("became the echo"), but escalation lacks narrowing of options; the "pulse" concept drives no causal tension despite consistent presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Bone towers charge the final image through resonant vibration, but environmental details remain atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices—dust whispers but never impedes action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes ("navigate without moving") lack tangible pressure; no escalation beyond steady lyrical intensification, and the conceptual cost of self-annihilation isn't dramatized through active forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through bone-dust resonance, but Q4's weak escalation caps thematic depth; avoids moralizing yet the final "never truly left" line borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reading strata as frozen wings") shines, but lyrical voice remains static under pressure—no syntactic compression during arrowhead fusion weakens crisis immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vibrant specificity in "centuries of layered dust" elevates prose, but scaffold phrases ("he knew this was where...") and weathered/reverent repetition create subtle synonym churn in mid-beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation-through-stillness feels inevitable, yet bone towers echo familiar fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation; emotional truth anchors the risk.</comment>
