<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between grief and purpose emerges subtly in her tears and memory of the child, but micro-choices lack layered value hierarchies under pressure; the final renunciation feels earned yet motivation remains singularly focused on teaching darkness without competing impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: darkness "pulsing with remembered starlight" reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost (tears, the child's memory), under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by line 3 with cobalt dock/rain establishing who/where/when early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dental mirror functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (angles reflections) and charges the final image ("silver thread stitching darkness to firmament"), while rain-soaked planks directly enable the starlight patterns critical to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as she adjusts shutters/mirror, narrowing options toward the final starlight dominance; cost is felt in her tears and the child's memory, but the abstract nature of "teaching darkness value" slightly obscures visceral escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weaving metaphor, with the final image ("darkness pulses quietly with remembered starlight") offering a resonant non-literal answer to whether darkness can "cradle wonder," avoiding moralizing while charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "harbor fog heavy as attention" and "shutters drifted apart, their pattern complete," with rhythmic control under pressure; no head-hopping, though the darkness’s "attention" risks slight POV leakage without full focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "nudged the angles until reflections nested like minnows," with propulsion matching scene needs. Near-miss: "drowned footsteps" borders on purple but serves atmosphere without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "taught darkness" avoids trauma tropes through specific bargemen details and the dental mirror’s unconventional use; risk-taking heightens stakes but the silent guardian archetype slightly limits freshness despite strong transformation.</comment>
