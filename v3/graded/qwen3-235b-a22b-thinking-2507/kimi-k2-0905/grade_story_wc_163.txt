<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientist vs ritual participant) manifest in micro-choices: "recorded nothing" despite training, pocketing feather before understanding its significance. Ghost’s undermotivated presence slightly weakens Vesper’s role as pressure catalyst.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: tearing the atlas page embodies the rhythm of belonging, while sunrise departure enacts the "unspoken promise." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through copepods illuminating ruins.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Moon-pipes aren’t backdrop—they enable the ritual breath; salt-eaten catwalk forces precarious movement. Rust floor’s transformation into constellation canvas charges the final image when copepods illuminate ruins. Minor over-description in mural details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation: her ritual choices (exhaling breath, tearing atlas) directly respond to sunrise deadline. Cost crystallizes when ghost dims at dawn—her potential abandonment becomes visceral, narrowing options to reciprocal recognition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paper bird’s transformation: belonging as "reciprocal recognition across impossible depth," not ownership. Final exhale reweights "rhythm of belonging" without moralizing. Slightly over-explained in "shared exile" line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "constellations ripple across black Atlantic skin," "barbs curled into tiny question marks." Rhythmic compression under pressure ("Time, however, was tidal") avoids cliché. Near-synonym use in feather evolution costs 0.2.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cedar and ozone" scent avoids purple prose through concrete specificity. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly ("Light pooled like luminous respite" vs clipped "Realizing..."). Generic "cedar" scent costs 0.1.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>"Rhythm of belonging" synthesizes ornithology/astrology into fresh emotional calculus. Bioluminescent copepods as "tiny hearts" transforms drowned city into living orrery. Near-echo of Ballardian tropes prevents 10.0.</comment>
