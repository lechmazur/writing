<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied choices: pressing petal to "pulse that lied," vials as armor versus kneeling in dust. No diagnostic label-speak; "honeyed regret, sharp with citrus of almost-joy" grounds epiphany in sensory truth. Final renunciation of detachment earned through layered emotional exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost: discarded armor coat, cracked vial, and "porous, aching affection" crystallizing her stance. Accumulative escalation via scent layers (grief → rage → wonder) tightens options under textural lens. Orientation perfect—"amber grotto at dusk" anchors within 20 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains every choice: fossilized sap enables the ritual, resin smell permeates transformation, and cooling stone mirrors her shift. Micro-setting triumph—the electric hum of earth Lira feels at the end directly charges closure, transforming environment into embodied cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("insight without empathy was just surveillance"), escalating through scent layers that narrow emotional options. Protagonist agency drives deepening: her choice to press the petal triggers the collapse of professional detachment. Cost is visceral—"discarded coat" armor and "cracked vial" reconfigure her world irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "half truths" as literal counterfeit emotions and her self-deceptions. Final image of palm on earth’s "steady, indifferent, alive" hum offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—the chemist’s "You came to understand" is earned through action, not sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "light itself seemed to hesitate," static crackling in hair. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (calm grotto → "honeyed regret" scent bloom). Voice modulates perfectly—clinical detachment ("professionally thorough") shatters into fragmented urgency ("She couldn’t answer") during transformation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels with textural density. "Scent bloomed like a bruise—honeyed regret, sharp with citrus of almost-joy" shows concrete specificity. Final line recharges opening with devastating simplicity: "a beginning" versus initial "professional thoroughness." Closure beat immaculate—no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perfume chemistry and emotional truth avoids cliché: "grocery store grief" and "copper-tasting forgiveness" transform tropes. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off—discarded armor and earth’s hum feel inevitable. Specificity ("blotter petal," fossilized sap) roots universals without abstraction.</comment>
