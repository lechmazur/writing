<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Jonah's contradictory impulses—hoarding money as territorial markers yet seeking circulation—drive his earned renunciation. The final ouguiya sacrifice concretely forecloses his circular grief with felt cost ("finally in circulation"). No diagnostic label-speak; embodied emotion in "soft as a moth wing" bills and "shoulder to shoulder" silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Jonah did not look back... circles meant to be broken by walking calmly forward" crystallizes stance with undeniable cost (sacrificed ouguiya, burning relics). Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (match flames, fire manners) to reconfigure the money's meaning without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The foreign money (tool/object) constrains choices: fanned east-west, reshaped into fire-respecting spiral, then sacrificed. Final image—"iron, popcorn, unopened roads"—charges closure by reweighting the train's sensory decay into possibility. No tourist catalog; details filtered through Jonah's grief (e.g., "dying fireworks" posters).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Jonah's agency: rearranging money from territorial markers to spiral reconfigures his grief. Cost is unmistakable—"finally in circulation" after sacrificing the ouguiya. Stakes tighten through the spiral's creation, but the startup's collapse (9H) lacks live-clock pressure on present choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the spiral reconfiguration answers "why paths circle back" without moralizing. Final image—"unopened roads" against burning train—resonates as non-literal solution to grief's loops. Avoids sentimentality; "bad GPS" metaphor grounds abstraction in lived experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Jonah notices "palaces he would never enter," Mara "pivot tables." Rhythmic control under pressure—"polished calm" refrains modulate tension. No head-hopping; single-POV maintained with clean free indirect style ("wanted to discover why some paths circle back").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("trumpet vines strangled its brass railings" does triple duty). Final line—"abandoned circus train kept its silence"—recharges opening with cost. Only microscopic flaw: "perceptively calm" repetition slightly dilutes peak-beat urgency, but justified by motif accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "abandoned place" trope via specific, verifiable details (Burmese kyat to Namibian dollar progression). Emotional truth in "grief reroutes like bad GPS" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causality) heightens stakes coherently; closure image would collapse without the money spiral's irreplaceable geometry.</comment>
