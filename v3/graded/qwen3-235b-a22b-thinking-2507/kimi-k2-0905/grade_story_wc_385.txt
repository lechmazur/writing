<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in sensory specificity ("taste the iron in a stranger's blood memory"), but mother's exposition ("I echoed because I never finished leaving") edges toward thematic echo, slightly undermining earned complexity in pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: cocoon dissolution and voice absorption crystallize the echo premise's reconfiguration. Orientation flawless ("canyon echo singer" + nexus under starlight by line 3), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held through pressure accumulation to earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Canyon acoustics actively constrain choice (echoes tightening lungs), while moth-weavers transform "webs of intrigue" from metaphor to literalized micro-setting that charges the dissolution climax. Final image ("threads drifting like thistledown") recharges opening motif with irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: recognizing mother's voice forecloses escape, forcing the seashell-pressing choice. Cost legible in dissolved cocoon and "pockets full of silence"—tangible tradeoffs that alter Lira's entire being as she descends "lighter" at dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action (singing farewell cadence), not moralizing. Final image—"a door that shut gently, leaving rooms of air"—resonantly answers "why echo?" without abstraction. Minor deduction for mother's slightly expositional dialogue diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("reed-blown melancholy," "corkscrew cavern") modulates rhythm under pressure; syntax compresses during climax ("Understanding struck like cold water"). No head-hopping; voice remains anchored in embodied sensory bias throughout descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "breathing gallery where echoes were spun" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One near-miss: "tasted of salt and dawn" risks overwriting but saved by contextual urgency. Final line's "carried by wind" crystallizes theme without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo physics and emotional closure transforms mythic tropes. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure, moth-weavers) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "progressive disclosure" method grounds the supernatural in tangible process, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
