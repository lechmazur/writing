<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes when Aurelia realizes she's "cataloguing disappearance" not preservation; the Chen grandmother's "rescuing you from forgetting" line forces a visible cost in her cracked composure and final "H for home" choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Aurelia's shift from observer to participant ("picked up dough") forecloses her archival path with felt cost (shattered identity), while the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density shifts toward communal singing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto's micro-setting (waterfall roar as lullaby, ice bridges melting) actively constrains choices; the opera glass lens evolves from filtering tool to discarded burden, charging the final image when it "faded to clear" as culture transcends preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Aurelia's agency when she photographs loaves "for distribution not display," but the thaw's role as external catalyst slightly dilutes escalation; cost is undeniable in her identity fracture yet lacks tactical consequence beyond the grotto.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bread initials and fading lens without moralizing; the final realization that "arts rescued her" reweights prior material as a resonant, non-literal answer to cultural preservation, avoiding thematic echo via concrete acts like children weaving bees.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in museum-habituated details ("historically oriented mind catalogued"), with rhythmic control shifting from precise cataloguing to visceral warmth in "dough, her cultured fingers learning muscle memory of survival."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in "rosewater dread" metaphor slightly muddles sensory coherence; otherwise, zero loops with exceptional density—"baked into existence, shaped from memory and necessity" compresses theme into propulsion without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms displacement tropes through specific grotto logic and the opera glass's irreplaceable role; the "H for home" turn grows organically from prior details while resisting sentimental resolution through "tears and laughter" as cultural fuel.</comment>
