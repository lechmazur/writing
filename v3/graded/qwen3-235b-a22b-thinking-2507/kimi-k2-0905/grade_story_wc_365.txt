<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied choices (swallowing cube, bracing in zero-g), but contradictory impulses lack simultaneous tension; final renunciation earns cost through sensory mapping shift, though micro-choices remain single-tracked under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "chart not places but consequences" crystallizes stance with felt cost (complicity realization), held under Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density reweights stakes; orientation anchors within 80 words via rust-dust and launch rails.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned bay functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (zero-g bracing, locker prying) and charges closure ("broken ribs settling into a question"); sensory hierarchy masterfully filters through mapper’s expertise (tasting air density, recording "ache of longing").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation (withheld truth → weaponized beams), but "cyclically spontaneous" trait lacks causal setup; cost is unmistakable in final complicity realization, though escalation leans slightly on shard mechanics over protagonist agency at pivotal loom collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through sensory mapping ("weight of withheld truth" → "mass of what you carry"), with final image reweighting prior material via "tremor in wrist" redirecting toward revelation—no moralizing, only earned resonance in copper-wire veins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust tasting of rust," "lilac rain" scent) and rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early via "cyclically spontaneous" refrains, though zero-g section risks slight POV drift into omniscient spatial choreography.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised gold" dawn and "copper wire of veins" exemplify textural specificity; only minor risk in "trapped cicada" simile (borderline stock) but redeemed by character-particular sensory focus in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography and quantum weaving feels inevitable; "mapping tremor" reframes sci-fi tropes through embodied female expertise, though "weaponized beams" premise slightly echoes genre conventions without deeper transformation.</comment>
