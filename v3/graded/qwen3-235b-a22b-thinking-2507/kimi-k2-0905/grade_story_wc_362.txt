<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("I have let you go" lie vs. warming prism) and embodied grief through prism/frost interactions feel authentic; sister’s off-page presence limits relationship crucible depth despite strong micro-choices like scraping the window circle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis ("I need you still" admission crystallizing into "fracture knit—not healed, but repositioned") lands with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as frost patterns deepen pressure toward the final image of melting initials.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quartz arbor’s singing and frost-braille constrain choices (Elian’s scraping/scraping circle), while the prism’s light-splitting charges the final image; "bruised violets" subtly mirrors grief without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through "truthful lies" escalating pressure (prism warming → mist freezing into mirrors); cost is visceral in the hairline fracture mirroring Elian’s inner break, though external conflict remains purely atmospheric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "truthful lies" reweight grief as active communion, not passive sorrow; final line ("carrying no prism yet leaving part of his grief") avoids moralizing while charging the frost patterns with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shifted hush," "glass-soft song") modulates with stress; rhythmic control shines in high-pressure beats ("He whispered the first lie... prism warm as if rejecting the untruth") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised violets and urgent reds" slightly overwrites but serves emotional charge; final line’s cadence ("proof offered to anyone willing to look through the patterns in frost") avoids closure muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-light-refraction transforms familiar tropes; quartz arbor’s mineral resonance with the prism creates specificity that avoids generic "magical realism," though mystic archetype risks slight familiarity.</comment>
