<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's embodied contradiction (ex-councilor now silent courier) drives choices; "gently persistent" shown through cart's rattling disguise. Boy lacks depth beyond symbolic function, weakening secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: silent bell vibration confirms network survival with felt cost ("sanctions tighten next week; rice will triple"). Orientation clear by line 3; lens (Accumulative) holds through closure's reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor's "cracked dome" and bell's engraving constrain choices (signal location, map home). Final bell vibration charges closure by making silence tangible; micro-setting shapes tactics and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via Mara's agency: baby formula delivery forces ledger expansion. "Sanctions tighten" line crystallizes cost, narrowing options to frequency over portions. One tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through pebble exchanges and "second ledger"—intergenerational support as contraband salt. Final image ("ridge remembered how to sing") offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "valley lights dimmed like censored stars" filters through Mara's political lens. Voice modulates under pressure (whispers below wind); no head-hopping despite multiple off-page voices.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loop ("pushing a rattling food cart... wheels disguised as noise" / "rolled the cart deeper... shuttered windows") costs 0.3. Propulsion intact despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" transforms exile trope through concrete ritual (bell vibrations, pebble returns). Fresh inflection in "memory passed like contraband salt," though baby formula subplot edges toward symbolic convenience.</comment>
