<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (fearing forgetting > falling), but "quietly explosive" trait edges toward diagnostic label-speak without sufficient embodied cost in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Mara’s release of memory kites crystallizes the "empty spaces remember" stake with undeniable conceptual cost ("swallow her mother’s laughter whole").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sky gondola functions as essential micro-setting—wicker dust in zero-g directly constrains her bracing and kite-release choices, charging the final image of "dusty starlight settled on her skin."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation via sensory/emotional density (regret storm → joy kites) reweights the dominant stake under its lens, though causal agency in pressure buildup feels slightly muted for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ending delivers resonant non-literal answer: the falling star *is* the telescope full of memories, proving empty spaces retain feeling—no moralizing, pure earned thematic weight through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in meteorologist diction ("nimbostratus pulsing with regret"); rhythm modulates perfectly from staccato tension ("A sudden lurch") to lyrical closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, though "memory kites" borders ornamental in first mention before earning causal weight in release sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms cloud taxonomy tropes through specific emotional synesthesia ("tastes like burnt coffee"); risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
