<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in micro-choices: Mara knocks over telescope (rejection) then rights it (acceptance), with "sculpt space for reflection" backstory directly fueling present stakes. No diagnostic labels; "salt galaxies on glasses" crystallizes transformed grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands with visceral cost: "alone yet crowded with tenderness" and hollow space "echoing with shared centuries" reconfigure her thesis. Orientation perfect in opening line; Accumulative lens holds through whale-song confirmation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower walls becoming "porous" directly constrains her transformation, charging the final "hollow space" image. Every sensory detail (lapis numbers, whale exhalations) pressures choices—salt and jasmine scent literally invade her self during alignments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake tightening when tile rejects transcription: "no proof, only participation" forces abandonment of academic duty for embodied connection. Cost is undeniable—"crowded with tenderness" forecloses solitary reason, altering tactics via ink-to-staves shift under midnight pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image of sky-as-parchment reweights migration routes as "patterns of continued becoming" without moralizing. Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: cedar prow, Ramadan lanterns, and transcribed flukes replace abstract grief with shared human attention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "ivory inlaid with lapis numbers that crawled when viewed sideways"—Mara’s skeptical precision defining her gaze. Rhythmic control peaks during memory surge where syntax fractures into sensory shards.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "exhalations misted her glasses with tiny salt galaxies" does triple duty as setting, emotion, and theme. Figurative language ("tuning fork waiting to be struck") serves propulsion without muddle, even during high-pressure memory surge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms whale migration trope through "migration routes of human attention"—a non-obvious synthesis where astronomical tools chart emotional resonance. Specificity of Nur’s jasmine-scented memory avoids generic interconnectedness.</comment>
