<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (scent memory vs anosmia) drives embodied micro-choices like rotating the screw; closure's earned endurance—carrying the screw without scent—forecloses healing with palpable cost in the pocket gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: the quarter-turn reassembly crystallizes Mira’s stance shift (from seeking smell to mapping emotion), with cost legible in "hollow nose might refill with meaning if not molecules" now resolved through tactile legacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw constrains choice (rotating its scar) and charges the final image (pocketed keepsake); fog’s diaphragm contraction mirrors Mira’s emotional constriction, avoiding static description through causal weather-pressure integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Mira’s agency: her realization about the screw’s origin transforms passive reflection into active reassembly, narrowing options to "humanize every future client" with cost visible in tears blurring the loupe—a single deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the screw’s reweighted meaning: "maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss as by landmark" crystallizes in the final walk, avoiding moralizing via the lavender-pinning woman and bicycle boy as organic extensions of Mira’s earned insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines—"reading between lines of metal she could no longer scent" filters setting through anosmia; rhythmic control under pressure peaks when fog "pressed against windows," compressing diction without sacrificing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; every line propels momentum (e.g., "warm, as though it still carried the heat of a stranger’s first breath" merges object, emotion, and backstory). Figurative language ("bottled dawn") remains character-particular in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms the "lost sense" trope through specific synthesis: anosmia reframed as tactile emotional mapping, with the screw’s origin story avoiding cliché via midwife’s metallic prayer—a risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
