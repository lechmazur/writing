<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract in grief portrayal; "weight she had been carrying" lacks embodied specificity despite strong micro-choices with the butterfly. Final renunciation of stone-carving for transformation gardens is earned through sleep-carved headstones revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: dawn emergence reconfigures memorials as living gardens with undeniable conceptual cost ("griefs too fresh for stone"). Accumulative lens holds through patterned intensification of poem fragments until butterflies spell grief's shape.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ancient greenhouse functions as micro-setting—rusted watering cans constrain chrysalis discovery, oak roots physically bind headstones. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn’t alter final tactics; "glass panes rattled with thundering calm" subtly charges closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: each poem-shroud discovery narrows options until sleep-carved headstones force the realization that "grief wasn’t a stone to be carved." Cost is unmistakable in "feeling the weight" amid poem-titled memorials.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>Theme emerges organically through poem-trading custom reweighted as "chisel strokes against sorrow." Avoids moralizing; final image of gardens where grief "continues transforming" answers central question without stating it, though "collective unspoken grief" borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines in tool-focused noticing ("chisels," "woven ribbon"), but stress compression under grief lacks psychic distance shifts—her articulation of "refusal to speak raw truth" feels over-calibrated for peak crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No fatal loops, but "thundering calm" creates slight dissonance in "glass panes rattled with thundering calm." High density maintained except poem fragments ("Hope is the thing...") risk checklist symbolism; final lines achieve clean propulsion with "gardens where it could continue transforming."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes butterfly migration with grief rituals freshly—poem-shrouded chrysalises and poem-titled headstones feel inevitable. Risk-taking (spectral mentorship via wingbeats) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "woven ribbon" transformation lacks visceral specificity.</comment>
