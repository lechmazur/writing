<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fought the change—I needed to stay flesh" amid metamorphosis, but "reluctant metamorphosis is still metamorphosis" veers toward label-speak without immediate embodied cost, narrowly avoiding diagnostic penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "two voices in one chest... last tear either would cry alone" crystallizes cost through shared flight. Persistent constraint (spices as memory conduit) shapes the final image’s weight without a decisive physical act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard setting actively constrains choices: starfruit bruises feet, roots drink from river of forgetting, backward-blossoms enable shadow-step. Final image of "blossoms burning gently without consumption" charges closure through environment’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Escalation via sensory density (ghost pepper stings, saffron dissolving) deepens the bond-reforging stake under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "branded lip" and final solitary tear, though single tightening lacks the density spike expected at this tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "lullaby sung backwards" reweights the bond beyond death without moralizing. Final line’s "keeping every promise the sky once forgot" offers resonant, non-literal answer to cosmic abandonment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in spice-scented memories ("tasted her first kiss") with rhythmic control during conjuration. Elision of phoenix’s origin taught early via "fever, wings tore through shoulder blades" and paid off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "caravan of memories" creates subtle figurative muddle in peak beat—spices as both literal paste and metaphorical caravan slightly blurs cause/effect without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of phoenix myth through sensory-driven ritual ("crushed saffron into honey"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes; "backward-blossoms revealing moon-seeds" feels inevitable yet revelatory.</comment>
