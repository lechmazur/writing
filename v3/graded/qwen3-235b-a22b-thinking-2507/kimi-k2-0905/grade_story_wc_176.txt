<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority richly embodied ("tears freezing into delicate lenses"), contradictory impulses (guilt vs. preservation drive) act in scene; minor reflection overuse in forgiveness backstory risks flattening present pressure despite concrete anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: voices braided into wind reconfigure preservation’s meaning with legible cost ("lighter by guilt, heavier by cargo"); orientation clear by 50 words, lens inferred by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum actively constrains choice (aurora lighting, frozen ropes) and charges final image (snowmelt dissolving card); micro-setting (punched card) evolves from fragile map to moving air, directly altering outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (preserving names before erasure) signaled immediately; escalation through rope reconfiguration narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost visible in weight shift, though deepening could intensify earlier pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: final image ("tasted each name on my tongue") resonantly answers central question without moralizing; "preservation is not a bronze bell" crystallizes earned wisdom through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora pulsed like a slow heartbeat") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyric compression taught early ("lost wax caster turned midnight archivist") pays off in closure; no head-hopping, register consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("coppery ghost of old blood") fuels propulsion without muddle; final lines ("tasted each name... forgotten sea") achieve image-driven closure with perfect cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of casting/archiving metaphors feels inevitable; "continuing vibration" reconfiguration grows organically from prior particulars; risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
