<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "precision" motivation rooted in titan's law creates credible restraint. Near-miss: pretender's "monarchical entitlement" slightly labels rather than embodies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost: dissolving coronet of dust motes crystallizes throne-as-ephemera. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through ink pellet's evolving pressure on identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellet functions as micro-setting that charges final image—rust smell becomes thematic anchor. Library's leaning shelves actively constrain movement and symbolize fragility of power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: whispered clue "Where the spine cracks" forces pretender's physical interaction with pellet. Cost is visible in unraveling glamour and dissolving coronet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final line "every throne is only ink yet to fade" reweights theme through concrete image, avoiding moralizing. "Truth drifts" marginalia evolves from clue to earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "constellations holding breath" reflects titan's temporal perspective. No head-hopping; pretender's actions filtered through titan's observational lens maintains psychic distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cold starlight threading veins" compresses metaphor with physical precision. Final line’s "faint rust smell" delivers resonant closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms library trope through "rune of drift" concept—truth as physical substance in ink pellet. Bold risk: climax hinges on tactile detail (smearing iron gall) rather than combat.</comment>
