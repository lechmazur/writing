<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines via concrete micro-choices (apologizing to sextant, labeling sorrow index) but "quantified sorrow" risks abstracting emotion; embodied contradiction in "whispered apology" while deconstructing shows strong value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: sextant-to-cedar transformation embodies cost (sorrow transmuted to ordinary time), with the pin-drop micro-turn crystallizing pressure under Accumulative/Textural lens; moonlight-healing attribute pays off causally in final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tower stones drinking moonlight actively constrain choices (healing mortar dictates repair timing); the sextant's brass limbs become the micro-setting that charges the final image—cedar roots "curled around parapet stones" reweights prior metallic sorrow with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quantified sorrow's burden) tightens through Mara's dream-mapping agency; each bead placement lowers sorrow by "measurable milligrams," creating tangible escalation where cost (ambient grief dissipation) visibly alters tactics until the sextant's transformation forecloses the repair path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically: trees storing "sums as quantified sorrow" crystallizes in the cedar's "numbered leaves trembling with residual grief," rejecting tidy morals by embracing ecological cost—final notebook label "quantify nothing" reweights prior material as resonant anti-thesis without direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots leaving wet prints that vanished," "dreams like frost") modulates under storm pressure; rhythmic control peaks when lightning forks invert the tower shadow—lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s "residual grief" trembling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats but "brass limbs twisted like a dead spider" risks mixed metaphor; exceptional density ("mercury siphoned from thermometer") propels momentum, though "constellations of sorrow" slightly strains toward abstraction in high-pressure dream-mapping sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief and quantification: "sorrow index 3.7, unit: rings" transforms data tropes through linden-planting memory; bold risk-taking (trees tallying "years until cut down") deepens stakes without gimmickry, making the mundane miracle feel inevitable.</comment>
