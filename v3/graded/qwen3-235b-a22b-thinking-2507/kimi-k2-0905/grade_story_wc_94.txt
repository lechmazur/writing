<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids stock phrasing but "cartography of scars" edges toward diagnostic label-speak during peak stress; micro-choices (tearing timetable strips) powerfully reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("arms raised to storm") reconfigures stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—the vanished Mara and star-shaped stain prove cost legibility without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Observatory functions as micro-setting: dome slit access and chemical trays constrain choices, while the petri dish directly charges the final image with "faint star-shaped stain."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Mara’s agency (tearing timetable, pouring solution); lightning overexposure complicates but doesn’t resolve, tightening stakes through chemical transformation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "rarefy words" to "broadcast into negative space"; final timetable—"Departures every instant"—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("smelled of diesel," "needle-cold droplets"); rhythm modulates with storm intensity, avoiding head-hopping while sustaining Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but "ancient static" slightly muddles metaphor (static as electricity vs silence) in high-pressure beat; zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms censorship tropes via chemical processes—"broadcast into negative space" synthesizes premise and stakes with bold risk that heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
