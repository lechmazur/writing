<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("words could outlast water" vs blistering skin) drives choices; "I am lonely beneath my gilt" embodies flaw without label-speak; Corin's silent presence creates earned status shift at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: vines lifting "tasting truth" reweights purification rules with conceptual cost ("courage to admit thirst"); Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to dawn emergence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting actively constrains choices (filtration veils, wilting vines); "gilded leaf" tool charges final image ("pocketful of zinc fragments clink like tiny bells") reconfiguring truth as infrastructure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through map reconstruction (one meaningful deepening); cost is unmistakable in "terrified of running out of words before breath" under Accumulative pressure of unopened letters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "candor in small moments" as actionable rule, not moral; final image of zinc bells reweights truth as irrigation without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("ink curled like scorched petals near deceit"); tense shifts to present in climax ("vines did not wilt") heightens pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "zinc-etched postal plate fragments" risks density but pays off in closure bells; minor register drift ("obsolete postmarks") offset by calligrapher lexicon.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes via linguistic ecology; "truth purifies air" premise commits fully to emotional specificity ("lonely beneath my gilt") without safety-hedging.</comment>
