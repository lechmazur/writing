<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied sensory choices ("taste every yesterday," "salt of future tears"), but contradictory impulses lack mid-crisis friction; final renunciation feels inevitable rather than wrestled with on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "become the garden's new keystone" crystallizes the texture-of-time motif into visceral sacrifice, perfectly reconfiguring the Accumulative/Textural drive lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hawthorn hourglass keystone constrains the final choice and charges the closing image—bark replacing skin—fulfilling the 9+ gate while avoiding overt symbolism through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as fading photographs force escalation toward the hawthorn confrontation; cost is unmistakable when she "tastes the salt of every future tear" pre-decision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image—"listen to the quiet quaking reverie of time grinding itself sharp"—resonantly answers "texture of time" without moralizing, reweighting all prior loss as necessary grain.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("wet memories of rain," "bark turning pliant as photographic paper") is distinct and pressure-modulated; no head-hopping despite temporal layering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "serrated" time metaphor slightly muddles the climax beat; density risks overwriting yet pays off in closure’s "grinding itself sharp" reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through hyperbolic botany and photographic decay; "texture of time" synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (Möbius paths as memory) heightening stakes.</comment>
