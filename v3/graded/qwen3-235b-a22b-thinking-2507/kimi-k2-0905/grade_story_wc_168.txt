<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias’s guilt/silence duality; micro-choices (tasting ash, drawing spiral) reveal value hierarchy with embodied cost. Slight reflection density in "mind’s darker forest" risks pressure flattening but stays anchored to the box.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: ash-to-ink transformation charges the spiral’s "grief path" with undeniable cost ("innocence once bargained is never returned"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens through sensory escalation (taste → tears → drawing) without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The porcelain box functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (cradling, opening) and charging closure via moonlight projection on Elias’s scar. Ridge path’s "granite altar" evolves from memory cue to active participant in the spiral’s creation, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically: translating pain shifts from abstract wish to tactile action (ash tasting → speaking → spiral drawing). Elias’s agency drives escalation—his choices narrow options toward "commissioned" endurance, with cost legible in "innocence once bargained is never returned."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ash-to-ink alchemy and the spiral’s widening grief path, avoiding moralizing. Final image (sprout as "forest’s reply") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "why speak?" without stated morals, earning wisdom through concrete particulars like salt-washed tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in firefighter lexicon ("pulaski," "crowned fire") and stress-tightened rhythm during ash tasting. Minor density in "thin blade of mercy" metaphor slightly dulls immediacy but stays voice-coherent; no head-hopping in tight single-POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("Elias pressed the ash to his tongue, tasting charcoal, tasting childhood campfires..."). Final line’s "first word in the forest’s reply" crystallizes closure without muddle. One borderline stacked modifier ("gentle yet skilled, shaped like lullabies") avoided deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ash as language and guilt as commission transforms firefighter trope. Risk-taking (lyric intensity, ash-to-ink alchemy) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the spiral’s organic emergence from scar/ash fracture feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
