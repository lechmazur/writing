<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hesitation trading mother's memory vs. desperation for peace) drive earned closure; embodied emotion ("warmth exiting through the circle") avoids labels. Lira's collapse slightly abrupt but charged by prior cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: memory loss and Lira's collapse crystallize "weaving new cloth." Accumulative lens holds; orientation clear by line 3 ("catacomb orchard breathed damp earth").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains choices (roots trammel ankles during hesitation) and charges final image ("roots pushing through bone"). Micro-setting (tarot card) evolves from tool to sprout, reweighting closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes signaled early ("holes that whistled at night"); tightening via memory trade (mother's hum for salt-trench trauma) narrows options with visceral cost. Agency-driven under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "patching souls is not sewing shut" reweights memory loss as resonant hum. No moralizing; final image ("holes... sang") answers central question without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusky resolve settled like twilight") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor repetition of "inlayed meanings" prevents 9.5+, but elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("apple seed sprouted; trunk cradled cranium like a crown"). Figurative language precise even in peak beats ("clinking softly like purses of mixed coins").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot bartering made visceral via "soul holes" and orchard's ledger. Risk-taking heightens stakes ("patching one soul puckers another") without gimmickry; emotional truth anchors novelty.</comment>
