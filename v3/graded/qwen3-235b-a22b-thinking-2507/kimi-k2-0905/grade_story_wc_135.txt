<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "metallic and impossible to swallow" taste of exile versus heartening duty; final choice to compile the echo earns closure with felt cost, though active struggle during quest could deepen micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the folded tone crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost of absence becoming sound; Accumulative lens holds through staggered fragments, though janitor's tally marks slightly weaken pressure coherence in middle beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Harbor constrains every choice—wet hemp guides search, fog layers mark time—and final "fresh margin" charged by tide directly reweights the cobblestone "words" motif, fulfilling micro-setting gate with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: demanding valve, seeking mouthpiece, and trading satchel for note narrow options under Accumulative lens; cost ("how exile tastes") visibly shapes the final breath and tone, though janitor's role slightly softens pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—compiling echo as "what absence sounded like"—with final image offering non-literal answer; avoids thematic echo despite "hearten" repetition, though "metallic" note could deepen moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("cobblestone a word washed away") and rhythmic control peak in trumpet blast sequence; psychic distance modulates perfectly from archivist's detached observation to visceral "staggered intervals of fear," with zero head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("boots lined like apostrophes" conveys absence through action); final "page finally turned" recharges opening motif with crystalline clarity, achieving flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms exile trope through "ocean-spray archivist" lens: compiling silence as archival work feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric structure, metallic note) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "reactively visionary" could feel less conceptual.</comment>
