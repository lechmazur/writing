<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("guarded by nature, not choice") and embodied emotion (seed pressing into wrist) create profound tension; final confession earns irreversible cost through prior causality without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands decisively when Briar speaks her truth: the seed's restraint and rewinding vortex crystallize irreversible cost ("half-bound by the plant that chose not to devour") under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The flesh-eating seed constrains choice (self-inflicted pain for protection) and charges the final image ("growing, ring by ring, into the timber"); every sensory detail (steaming blood, creaking trunks) filters through Briar’s guilt-ravaged perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Briar’s agency: the seed’s activation ("pain bloomed") and confession directly narrow options, with cost legible in the vines halting at her elbow—a trade-off where truth binds but saves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the orchard’s "slow rings" storing confession rejects tidy morals, reweighting "I loved the enemy" into sap and scar without abstraction or final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—"trunks creaking like old siege towers remembering the push of war" embodies Briar’s militarized grief; rhythm modulates from staccato tension to liquid closure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vines wrapping her arm but stopping at the elbow" achieves devastating density with propulsion. One borderline elevated phrase ("method of expanding circles") prevents 10.0 but never dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "confession" tropes through ecological consequence: guilt grows physically in timber. Fresh inflection lies in the enemy’s love preserving "singing" trees—a specificity that avoids moral symmetry.</comment>
