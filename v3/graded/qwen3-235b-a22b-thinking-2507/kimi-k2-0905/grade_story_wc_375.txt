<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "gift turned trap" and "fingers twitching" under pressure; micro-choices like pinning parchment and resetting the lock earn closure through concrete action, though emotional layers slightly over-tidy at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when the lock releases laughter—cost is palpable in "tears left clean tracks" and the open reset to zero; Accumulative lens holds through crystal growth reweighting memory into geology.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal cave functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: quartz wings and mineral skin directly constrain choices (drawing triggers growth) and fuse with the dawn beam; "taste of iron and pennies" evolves from setting detail to thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the lock clicks toward 9-7-4—her drawing agency narrows options as crystals encrust pigment, and the cost (mother’s dissolving portrait) charges the final image; pressure escalates through sensory density rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "quartz wings" transforming dissolution into collaboration; the final dawn-colored laughter reweights memory without moralizing, though "inescapable callings are not cages" edges toward explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "charcoal-blackened cheeks" and "cracks her nails" filter all observation; voice modulates from fragmented tension ("tried to breathe without remembering") to lyrical flow during collaboration, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in peak beats—sentences like "crystals grew along her new lines" propel momentum; minor density risk in "auroral sorrow" repetition, but "quartz and feldspar" avoids purple prose by charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory-as-geology feels inevitable; "dawn in the mouth of the world" transforms cliché into fresh inflection while deepening stakes—risk-taking heightens emotional truth without gimmickry.</comment>
