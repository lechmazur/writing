<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete actions ("deliberate steps," "coaxing resilience") avoids therapy-speak, but lacks contradictory impulses during pivotal weaving—flawless execution of quiet resolve slightly over-smooths struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "resilience bloomed like star-fruit in the rubble" crystallizes conceptual cost with undeniable pressure; Accumulative lens held through silk's evolving glow without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Magician's silk functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (weaving beams) and charges the final image ("fluttered like flags"); orchard planet's floating arches directly pressure Thistle's tactics from discovery to descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure ("seventh night" trigger, intensifying moonlight), but mid-process cost remains abstract—visible toll on Thistle's body or resources would elevate escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: "bartered awakenings" evolves from confusing exchange to hammer rhythm, avoiding moralizing; final image reweights rubble as fertile ground without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("shifting shadows," "azure defiance" lexicon), but "bartered awakening stir" slightly exceeds blacksmith's plausible diction; psychic distance tightens effectively during the climb.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; rhythm varies purposefully ("He raised it... arch descended slightly" accelerates tension); single minor tell ("creating a tapestry that caught moonlight") after vivid showing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "orchard planet" physics with emotional resilience avoids tropes, but "quiet architect" conclusion echoes familiar redemption arcs—specificity saves it from derivative safety.</comment>
