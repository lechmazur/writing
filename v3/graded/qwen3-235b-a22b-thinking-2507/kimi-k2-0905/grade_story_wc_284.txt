<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("prudently daring") drives micro-choices like ignoring knee pain to uncover coordinates, but Sera's off-page presence limits relationship pressure despite poignant portrait destruction. Final choice to transmit earns change through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: transmission sent but consequences unknown, with snowdrop blooming as reconfigured hope against crushed pillbox. Cost legible in "bandaged bleeding knee" and scar tissue "pulling tight as if smiling."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: pillbox constrains choices (jump-starting keypad, grinding portrait), while snowdrop blooming through slate charges final image as "receiver for courage." Environment actively pressures decoding under thaw deadline.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: snow-scoured codes narrow options to manual decryption, dead keypad forces pillbox battery improvisation. Cost crystallizes when he crushes the pillbox—destroying his last identity to enable transmission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "spies are gardeners" insight earned by planting transmission like a seed, with snowdrop blooming as non-literal answer to "unused courage." No moralizing; final image reweights stakes through snow-soft signal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature blends military precision ("staggered cipher") with poetic fragility ("silver hush"). Rhythmic control peaks during transmission: short staccato lines for tension, lyrical flow for snowdrop revelation. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "face half molten, loyalty dissolved" compresses backstory without telling. Final line "snow-soft and relentless" recharges motif while advancing theme. Figurative language sparse but precise in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms spy tropes through specific details: micro-code in pillbox lid, snowdrop as courage symbol. Avoids safety middle via quarterly-profits betrayal motive. Fresh synthesis feels inevitable when transmission echoes Sera's "gardeners" metaphor.</comment>
