<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") drives action; embodied emotion ("breath that tasted of recycled air and regret") and micro-choices under pressure (naming filaments) feel character-particular. Minor deduction for abstract filaments (Mother’s Promise) slightly diluting concrete causality at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: power dimming, gravity slackening, and pen cooling during rewrite. Accumulative lens holds via density increase (filaments shimmering) and cadence shift ("She landed softly, anomaly easing like a sigh"). Cost proof: "power was borrowed by the rewriting" crystallizes tradeoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dried-up pen) constrains choice: etching "absence that glowed" rewrites reality. Final image charged by pen cooling and "warmth rising through soles," satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy impeccable—gravitational tug felt in bones, not just described.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: coordinates dated "tomorrow" force edit via contingent relationships. Cost unmistakable in physical toll (floating, dimmed lights) and emotional weight ("regret" in breath). Dominant stake (threshing meaning) tightens through one decisive deepening (unbending seeds).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "seeds no longer wrong, merely early" reweights error without moralizing. Final image ("history would remember itself slightly differently") offers resonant answer to central question. Minor deduction as "gentle uncertainty" edges toward abstraction in closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: professional lens ("thresh meaning from experience") shapes diction. Rhythmic control under pressure ("Confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand") avoids template cadence. Patterned elision (anomaly distorting time) taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dry reservoir thirsting for ink that had never been refilled" compresses metaphor and stakes. Final line ("each breath an edit that refused to end") crystallizes theme with propulsion. Figurative language in peak beats ("filaments settled") enhances clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Non-obvious synthesis: "confidently uncertain" as method transforms editing-history trope. Risk-taking (causality inversion via gravitational anomaly) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—swap "celestial interpreter" for generic scientist and emotional arc collapses.</comment>
