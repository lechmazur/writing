<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("swaying certainties") drives action; embodied emotion via "chlorophyll sorrow" and diaphragm-piercing rootlet. Final renunciation earned through incremental smudging, though emotional layering slightly abstract in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis: "truth evacuated" entry crystallizes cost (4.7g sorrow) with visible consequence (sky clearing). Accumulative lens holds; "heavier" repetitions tighten pressure. Orientation clear by line 3; cost legible in stone's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Weather station constrains every choice: anemometer counts heartbeats, instruments dictate forecasts, illustration becomes topographic map. Micro-setting (quilt, logbook) charges final image; sensory details filter through oracle's urgency ("tasting iron and pine resin").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weighing swallowed truth) signaled immediately; escalation via physical symptoms (rootlet piercing diaphragm) and stone's rising weight. Agency in deliberate smudging forecloses path with visceral cost (expelled stone). Pressure coheres under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "weight becomes prophecy," stone as "polished knowing." Final image (wrapped stone in rain gauge) reweights truth without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; "valley temporarily innocent" charges sorrow with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tasting auroral light," "breath blooming like shattered glass") reflects oracle's state. Rhythmic control shifts under stress (short clauses during rootlet piercing). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "snow hissed against shutters; anemometer spun above, counting heartbeats no one claimed" does triple duty. Final line's cadence ("peripherally aware that innocence, like fever, would return") charges closure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms oracle trope via "fault-tolerant" specificity and truth-as-physical-weight conceit. "Swaying certainties" redefines prophecy through peripheral vision mechanics. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring closure; removal of any core element would fracture logic.</comment>
