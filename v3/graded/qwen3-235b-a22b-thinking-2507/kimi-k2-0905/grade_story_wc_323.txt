<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the instructor’s truth-telling versus near-lie to the boy; embodied cost in the boy’s rust-bleeding fingers and trembling. Micro-choice to hand over the chain link crystallizes hierarchy of values without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the "navigable void" where the chain link was aches with the weight of lost horizons. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through geometric density, and the cost proof test passes via "hollow that ached like lungs remembering air."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting (chain link) constrains choices—used as sextant, grinding tool, and final void—while the benthic city’s water pressure mutes speech and shapes plankton-light. Final image’s "navigable void" charges the closure through tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the boy discovers the path, narrowing options from abstract hope to active navigation. Cost is visceral (bloody fingers, the hollow in the pocket) and conceptual (navigation as "refusing to disappear"), driven by the instructor’s teaching agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through edge geometry’s "unfolding horizons," reweighted by the final void as a non-literal answer to "can we return?" Avoids moralizing; the "navigable void" resonates with earned complexity about loss and direction without false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in water-filtered observations ("grief muffled by water," "rust’s cold curve") and rhythmic control during tension. "Balancedly curious" repetition risks slight register drift but serves alien-influenced lexicon without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" repetition triggers minor patterned-artifact penalty (-0.3), but prose otherwise achieves high density ("plankton into spirals of silent light") and propulsion. Final line’s "navigable void" avoids figurative muddle despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation metaphors with alien geometry transforms tropes; "unfolded horizons" gains specificity through edge geometry’s knife-like diagonals. Risk-taking in quiet closure lands through concrete images (chain link’s void) without gimmickry.</comment>
