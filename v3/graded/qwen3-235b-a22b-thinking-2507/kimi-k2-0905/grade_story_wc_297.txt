<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via scar-linking method and choice between rooting or fleeing; embodied "lungs fizzing with anxious elation" avoids label-speak. Slight abstraction in "dreams had grown lonely" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density ("time unspooled sideways") to Charged Poise closure. Cost crystallizes in "if I stayed, I would never leave the glade"—irrefutable and on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glade functions as micro-setting: eclipse footprints constrain movement, and final leaf-on-sidewalk image charges closure. Near-purple prose ("metallic hush") slightly dilutes specificity at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via deepening ("time unspooled sideways") not reversal, per accumulative lens. Agency in scar-grafting choice narrows options to irreversible rooting, with cost ("name would join fireflies") unmistakable on final page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cobalt leaf on cracked sidewalk reweights "intersection" without moralizing. Final image ("dreamers woke with faint hedge-scars") offers resonant non-literal answer to loneliness premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via scar-antenna metaphor and cobalt-centric imagery. Rhythmic control under pressure ("kite string humming before it snaps") flawless. Minor repetition in "anxious elation" prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure-damaging artifacts; final line’s "forever at dusk" achieves textural precision. Opening density slightly overloads ("metallic hush... bruised and bled") with adjacent figurative phrasing, triggering minor cohesion penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms urban fantasy tropes via scar-grafting and cobalt ecology; "living intersection" concept synthesizes city/soil tension freshly. Risk-taking (permanent transformation) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "root-bound visionary" echoes familiar phrasing.</comment>
