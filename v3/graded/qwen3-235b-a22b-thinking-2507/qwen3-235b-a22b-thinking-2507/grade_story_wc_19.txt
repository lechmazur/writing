<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (clutching doll while seeking silence), but the doll's sudden warmth shift feels unmotivated; "contradictory impulses" test nearly met but slips on final causal link to sprouting vine.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("silence wasn’t emptiness but a living thing"), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density reweights stakes; gravity’s return crystallizes the earned shift without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (cradling the vine), constraining choice when pressed into heartwood; sensory details like "honeyed sunlight and ancient coins" are purpose-driven and filtered through Elara’s urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (terror of oppressive silence vs. hunger for living quiet) tightens through failed vial attempts, culminating in the doll-surrender trade-off; cost is legible in "warmth a compass against the coming descent" but escalation lacks one tangible pre-sprout consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sprouted vine’s resonance ("silence to be nurtured, not hoarded"), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "bunker’s mechanical drone" as flavor rather than flaw, though the "forgiveness" hint edges toward sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable ("lungs, tight as knotted string"), with syntax mirroring Elara’s constriction/release; non-standard phrasing ("xenial trellis") is voice-motivated and taught early, though "contracted with purpose" slightly drifts into abstract register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters in "intangibly tangible as breath against glass yet dense enough to anchor a falling star" – mixed metaphors dilute momentum; otherwise, high density ("cataloged in a journal lined with dried petals") serves the Accumulative lens without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory deprivation and botanical growth avoids trope; the gravity-inversion device transforms claustrophobia into tangible stakes, though the doll’s role risks sentimental convenience without the warmth-to-vine causality.</comment>
