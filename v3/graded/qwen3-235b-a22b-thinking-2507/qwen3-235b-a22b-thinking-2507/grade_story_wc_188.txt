<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied emotion ("gravity of hopelessness pulled at her bones") and contradictory impulses (collecting morbid keepsake vs. seeking sparks). Micro-choices like lighting the rag knot reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Minor deduction for slightly over-explained forest fire backstory exceeding BRR limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: the flame reflecting in mosaic shards makes "Hope is the first spark" glow, crystallizing defiance with visible cost (remaining in starless night). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density increase and chant cadence shift. Orientation clear by word 20.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Living fortress actively constrains choices: dry fountain basin enables flame lighting, thorned vines guide movement. Micro-setting charges final image (embers in basin) while scent/tactile details filter through designer POV. Near-perfect integration, slight deduction for "relic of discarded artistry" abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defying hopelessness) signaled early through guilt. Escalation via protagonist agency: rag knot deepens despair before mosaic reframes it, culminating in flame lighting as active resistance. Cost legible in "starless night" endurance. Minor pressure inconsistency at rampart discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "serious playfulness" shifts from alien concept to resistance via flame lighting. Final image reweights "Hope is first spark" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; mosaic phrase earns resonance through prior particulars rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tremor in moth’s wing," "scent thick as velvet") reflects designer POV. Chant creates rhythmic control under pressure; syntax compresses during discovery ("Near the crumbling western rampart..."). Minor deduction for "gravity of hopelessness" abstraction in high-stress moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("Step. Breathe. See." syncs with pulse). Final line "Step. Breathe. Create." recharges motif with propulsion. Slight deduction for "relic of discarded artistry" abstraction in peak beat, but no closure impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms redemption tropes through specific synthesis: hope as "serious playfulness" via controlled flame (not fireworks). Blooming fortress setting and mosaic concept feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
