<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "buried talent surged...to mute her grief" as micro-choice to press the feather confronts fear of reopening wounds; embodied emotion via "tears cut paths through dust" avoids therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "remembering didn’t scorch; it soothed" crystallizes the shift from pain to balm under Accumulative/Textural lens; dawn’s encroachment forces irreversible action with visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The raven’s feather constrains every pivotal choice—from coaxing the stone to scraping its essence—and charges the final image as a "compass," transforming micro-setting into indispensable closure vessel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: nightly reality fraying into mist narrows options to a single beat, with "trembling hands" scraping the stone embodying the felt cost of choosing permanent truth over fleeting vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through texture-as-language ("rough-hewn beam," "scratch of wool blankets"), culminating in non-literal closure: home as "heart’s architecture" reweights memory without moralizing; no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "fractured into a hundred anxious eyes" filters setting through trauma; rhythmic control intensifies during stone contact with tactile compression ("soft as a sigh," "downy texture met ancient grooves").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, though "vibration in the stone that hummed beneath her feet" slightly overwrites physical logic; no closure-dulling artifacts, but one density slip prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lost language" trope through somatic revelation—home as texture constellation—while risk-taking (tactile epistemology) heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional specificity avoids abstraction.</comment>
