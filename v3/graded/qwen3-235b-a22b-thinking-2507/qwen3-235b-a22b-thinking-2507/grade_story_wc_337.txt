<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete: "burning silence surged—a memory of saltwater filling lungs" embodies grief without labels. Contradictory impulses (professional precision vs raw panic) act simultaneously during brother's knot. Final endurance as "broken mask restorer momentarily whole" earns stasis with visible cost in "dull ache."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "dull ache" after brother's grounding crystallizes stakes. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through "interlaced hush" density increase. Escalation lacks middle development—brother's knot arrives without meaningful tactical shift from first knot's process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary constrains choice: refracted light enables spectral visibility, starlight dictates work conditions. Final "dust motes dancing in the interlaced hush" charges closure. Tapestry needle's "prism's tear" reprise proves micro-setting necessity—tool physically alters tactics when pricking thumb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding spirits) tightens through brother's knot escalation. But pressure lacks visible mid-process cost: no tactical shift when silence shifts from cold to burning. Brother's resolution pays cost, but escalation feels compressed without earned adaptation between knots.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "silence no longer burden but balm" reweights premise via brother's dissolving terror. Final image ("mending world’s fractures from within accumulating quiet") offers non-literal answer to "dead need grounding, not graves" without moralizing. Complexity honored—grief remains "dull ache" even amid healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "solidified shadow" for silence reflects restorer’s tactile POV. Rhythmic control shifts from precise ("needle slipped between fibers") to fragmented during panic. "Lucid unrest" slightly breaches lexicon—clinical term jars amid visceral drowning memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat, but mid-section synonym loops ("trembling rainbows"/"trembling quiet") dull momentum. "Accumulated silence" repeats without sufficient variation across adjacent lines. Final paragraph’s "refracted... dust motes dancing" achieves crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through net mechanics: "silence as tangible weight" feels fresh via knotted sighs. Risk-taking heightens stakes—brother’s knot risks her sanity—but prism sanctuary edges toward magical realism cliché. Specificity saves it: whalebone button, tapestry needle’s ice-like sharpness.</comment>
