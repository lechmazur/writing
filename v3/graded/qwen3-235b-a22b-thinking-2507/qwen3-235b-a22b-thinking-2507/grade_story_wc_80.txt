<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority concrete through calloused hands and "heart ached for the forgotten," but contradictory impulses under pressure (focus vs grief) lack visceral embodiment during the pivotal pry-bar heave; micro-choices like using inkwell knife show character-bound knowledge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: sealing watercolors transforms "interlaced absence" into tangible legacy, the sea’s weight and her "quiet vow" crystallizing stakes; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening pressure to this moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Antique inkwell constrains choices (slitting packet, anchoring writing) and charges the final image ("vessel carrying...essence"); submerged pavilion actively resists via "water resisting like cold silk," shaping every tactic from rod-wresting to cornerstone placement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" motivation drives the pry-bar heave, with physical strain ("muscles burning") and emotional cost ("pulse hammering") narrowing options to the cavity discovery; escalation tightens via sea’s resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "interlaced absence" evolves from abstract concept to watercolors in her hands, then sealed time capsule; final image reweights prior material without moralizing ("dreams archived within the stone" as resonant answer).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: surveyor’s precision ("ten feet of restless sea") blends with poetic sensitivity ("spectral in filtered light"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure (short sentences during heave, lyrical flow in reflection), no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor prose loop: "wrested" repetition in adjacent sentences about rod and pry bar; otherwise high density with propulsion ("Stone grated, a sound like bones breaking") and zero figurative muddle in peak beats, though "hushed blaze" slightly overused.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of occupational detail (surveyor’s vellum, iron-gall ink bleeding) with emotional excavation; transforms "relic discovery" trope through specific "archeologist of abandoned dreams" framing and the singular vow to the depths.</comment>
