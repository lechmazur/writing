<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Liam’s roadie instincts vs appraiser facade; embodied emotion via calloused thumb snagging cloth and "chalk and shame" taste. Flaw: Maya backstory leans tell-y despite functional cue, slightly undermining micro-choice urgency at the critical cloth-revelation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "purpose wasn’t found in flawless displays" crystallizes stance shift after cloth revelation. Accumulative lens holds; quarry’s silence reweighted from suffocating to resonant with felt cost in "worn, repaired, scars of sound." No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quarry pit and speaker cloth constrain choices—Liam’s appraisal task forces tactile scrutiny that triggers transformation. Final image ("space waiting for the next note") charges cloth’s meaning. Sensory hierarchy masterful: ozone/beer odor and thread count reflect roadie POV, not tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Liam’s agency: abandoning "minimal value" appraisal for keeping cloth forecloses his appraiser identity. Single escalation beat (cloth revelation) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in "scrap warm in his pocket" signaling irrevocable stance shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: final quarry image reweights "echo valley longing" from dirge to call, answering "where is purpose?" through scarred objects. Avoids moralizing; complexity in embracing failure’s resonance. "Scars of sound" crystallizes earned wisdom without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in roadie lexicon ("Thread count: 12x12") and rhythmic compression during cloth revelation. Voice modulates from clinical appraisal to lyrical urgency without slippage. Minor flaw: "confidently uncertain" repeats verbatim, slightly dulling pressure in high-stakes beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "chalk and shame" and "worn, repaired" doing triple duty. Slight overwriting risk in "sunlight bled... motes dancing" saved by quarry’s thematic echo. Final line’s "wrest meaning from the quiet" avoids cliché through concrete action, though "warm in his pocket" edges sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "after the applause" trope via specific roadie-to-appraiser fall: purpose isn’t in crowds but "scars of sound." Authentic emotional truth in failure’s aftermath. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off; quarry’s emptiness as active space for new music feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
