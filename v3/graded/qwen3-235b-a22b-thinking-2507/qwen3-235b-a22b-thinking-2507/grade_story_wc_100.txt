<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (burial vs. restoration) manifests in physical choices; embodied exhaustion grounds stubbornness. "Worn smooth by exhaustion" risks abstraction but saved by concrete actions like repurposing tools.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "fragile stillness" and "rest forever deferred" crystallize the trade-off. Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as light transforms the space, reweighting stakes through sensory shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Brass diving bell and cracked lens constrain choices (e.g., lens alignment using plankton light); final image of sweeping beam charges closure. Micro-setting mastery—tools become emotional conduits without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory deepening: distress signals evolve from "frantic SOS" to "calming pulse," narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost ("rest forever deferred") is visceral in the deferred peace, but pressure lacks one tangible loss (e.g., tool failure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "permanent address" reweights from burial to light-based rest. Final image—"lens held the deep’s quiet"—answers the central question without moralizing, embracing ambiguity of "fragile" peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: undertaker’s precision ("repurposed for restoration") colors every observation. Rhythmic control under pressure ("water pressing in, the bell a fragile bubble") avoids ventriloquism despite single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts; "skeletal jellyfish" metaphor risks abstraction but integrates seamlessly. Minor scaffold in "ink-blurred manuscripts floating like spectral jellyfish" slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: undertaker’s burial logic applied to spiritual rest transforms a trope. Risk-taking (quiet closure, no antagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry—"chased stillness" redefines peace as active vigilance.</comment>
