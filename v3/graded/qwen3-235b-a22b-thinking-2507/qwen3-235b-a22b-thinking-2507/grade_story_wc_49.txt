<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "voice rough from disuse" amid ritual precision; embodied panic when threads fray avoids label-speak. Final choice using grandfather’s stone earns endurance with felt cost in near-failure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens, but cost proof fails—the fraying threads’ near-loss isn’t visibly charged in the reborn vines’ final image, missing the "exact sentence" requirement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vine tendril constrains every choice: plucked at alignment, coiling on the spindle, flaring with the stone. Final image of "gilding reborn vines" charges the tool’s role in mending the wound, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as threads "fray at the edges," narrowing options to the stone’s fragment. Agency-driven deepening succeeds, but cost (the fraying) lacks visible legibility in closure’s resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "golden stories" as tangible threads—not abstraction. Final image of "vines humming" reweights "courage to remember" without moralizing, though "truest harvest" risks slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "dewdrops caught fire in their glow"; rhythmic control peaks with "thrums, then spun." No head-hopping; elision of villagers’ absence taught early and paid off in dusk’s return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Panic clawed at Elara’s throat" uses diagnostic label-speak in high-pressure beat, triggering -0.4 artifact penalty. Otherwise pristine propulsion—no loops, density soars in "threads frayed, unraveling before earth."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tinkerer-as-ritualist transforms folklore tropes. Bold risk in Accumulative structure heightens stakes; "remedies" reframing sacred practices feels inevitable through vine tendril’s specificity.</comment>
