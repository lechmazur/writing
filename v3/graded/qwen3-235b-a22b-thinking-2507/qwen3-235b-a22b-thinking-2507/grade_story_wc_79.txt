<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority concrete but lacks contradictory impulses until climax; "quietly driven" trait shown through ochre-stained hands yet final resolve lacks layered hesitation. Micro-choice of stylus pressure reveals value hierarchy, but emotional contradiction surfaces too late.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Kael’s resolve crystallizes with "dread intensifying, pressing down" making conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation anchors by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-break at fracture revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Turtle-shell setting functions as micro-setting: the scute plaza constrains Kael’s action (stylus tracing), and bioluminescent lichen patterns directly charge the final map discovery. "Sun-bleached shells" filter perception with character-particular urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: correlating whistle note with fractures narrows options to one path. Cost is legible in "dread intensifying" as he grasps the watchers’ waiting—conceptual price shapes his final choice without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell resonance mechanics, not moralizing. Final image reweights "sunwashed dread" into active confrontation, but "grammar of the lost expedition’s fate" borders on abstraction, slightly diluting earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "stylus biting into chalk-dust" and ochre-stained hands; rhythm modulates from measured tracing to hammering heart. Slight register drift in "pattern language" phrasing disrupts voice during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "fracture line widened by a fraction" demonstrates high density. Minor template cadence ("His hands... moved... driven") in early paragraph costs 0.2, but propulsion remains flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: turtle-shell city transformed through cartographic pattern language. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; the whistle’s sonic key mechanic feels inevitable yet fresh in hindsight.</comment>
