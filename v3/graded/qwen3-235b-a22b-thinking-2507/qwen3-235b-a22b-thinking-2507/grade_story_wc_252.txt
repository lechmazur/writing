<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction manifests physically (gills blooming, saltwater healing) rather than through exposition; micro-choices like tightening grip on scrimshaw reveal hierarchy of values. Slight deduction for "half-sea" dockworker comment bordering on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("shedding a skin that no longer served her") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Whale song escalation deepens pressure through sensory density, not causality. Backstory about violence remains slightly unanchored but doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe actively constrains choices (wading depth = commitment level) and charges final image. Whalebone scrimshaw's physicality—cool to warm, carving glow—drives transformation. Environment isn't backdrop but the very mechanism of change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation through sensory deepening: whale song vibrations → scrimshaw warmth → gills blooming. "Combative tenderness" pressure narrows options until detachment becomes inevitable. Cost is legible in "calloused hands of dockworkers" versus "embrace of the deep."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (saltwater healing, iridescent scales), not abstraction. Final whale pod image reweights "true nature" as communal belonging, avoiding moralizing. "Shedding skin" crystallizes the cost without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water tasted of freedom," "liquid emerald") with rhythmic control during transformation. Minor deduction for "combative tenderness" phrasing bordering on abstract label in peak pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the island’s light enveloped her, dissolving the boundaries" do triple duty. One hairline flaw: "combative tenderness" repetition slightly dulls closure beat's immediacy despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms mermaid trope through dockworker specificity and scrimshaw’s whalebone texture. Emotional truth in fearing transformation while craving it. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
