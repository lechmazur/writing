<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's blithe cheer versus solemn decoding focus; embodied emotion in "fingers stained with earth" and thread-humming regrets avoids labels. Final renunciation of forgetting earns cost through prior causality, though secondary pressure absence limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "weight of understanding settling" crystallizes stakes with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through glyph-density escalation; orientation clear by "pruned moonshade blossoms" (line 3). No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt silo functions as micro-setting: its "cool gloom" constrains decoding via starlight limitation, charging the final image. Sovereign case's velvet lining enables glyph visibility, directly shaping tactics and closure. No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen texturally as thread-glyphs reveal layered intentions (regret, resolve, love), narrowing Elara's focus toward the plea for remembrance. Cost legible in "weight of understanding," though escalation lacks overt protagonist-driven narrowing beyond meticulous attention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "frayed, unraveling threads" mirroring forgotten intentions reweights at closure as "echoes finally heard." Avoids moralizing; final image resonates as non-literal answer to "shape of intentions" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "velveteen gloom," "thread humming of regret" filter reality through Elara's gardener-decoder lens. Rhythm modulates from blithe hums to "concentrated silence," with compression ("stars wheeled overhead") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "needle-thin tweezers coaxing threads apart" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("cobalt silo drink the starlight") avoids muddle, serving atmosphere without obscuring cause/effect in peak decoding beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery tropes via specific logic: chess clock timing system, tapestry border as cipher. "Tenderly organized" trait synthesized through pruning precision and thread handling, avoiding quirkiness. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens emotional stakes coherently.</comment>
