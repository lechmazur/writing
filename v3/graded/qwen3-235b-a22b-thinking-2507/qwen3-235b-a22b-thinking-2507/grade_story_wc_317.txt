<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority reveals contradictory impulses (caution vs. hope) through concrete micro-choices like weighing invasive species risks against nurturing potential; final planting choice earned by prior reflection but epiphany about "test" edges toward convenient insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: seed planted with cost of patience ("innovation began in obscurity, needing patience") legible in final image; Accumulative lens inferred early via sensory/textural buildup holds through brook's whispering approval.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brook functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (determines planting location) and charges closure image ("seed rested in the earth, waiting"); sensory details like water's "soft flow over stones" filter through Elias' receptivity to quiet signals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single deepening (note's meaning clicking: "flow of water was constant, yet silent") narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost of unseen labor made undeniable when Elias feels "profound connection to the slow unfolding of life" during planting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image of seed "waiting for its time" reweights innovation theme non-literally through patience and obscurity; avoids moralizing while subtext in brook's flow ("whisper approval") embodies cost of nurturing unconventional ideas without stated payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias' focus on "quiet signals" shapes syntax ("storm-born silence deepened"); rhythmic control under decision pressure shown through tightened phrasing during planting ("carefully dug... placed... covered gently").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("storm-born silence" repeated verbatim in planting sequence) causes negligible momentum drag; otherwise high density with propulsion via concrete verbs ("knelt," "dug," "patted") avoiding overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corpse flower's decay symbolism with innovation's disruptive nature feels inevitable; escape room context grounds abstract theme through specific "orthogonal approaches" logic rather than generic inspiration tropes.</comment>
