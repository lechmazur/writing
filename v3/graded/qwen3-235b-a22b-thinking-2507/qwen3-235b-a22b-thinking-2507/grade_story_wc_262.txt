<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks contradictory impulses; "spatially imaginative" trait stated not embodied in choices. Closure choice (transfer) earned yet internal conflict remains surface-level, missing micro-choices under pressure that would elevate to 8.0+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost ("dawn approached, demolition crews"), but escalation relies on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven deepening. Orientation solid early; Accumulative lens holds though cost legibility could intensify earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting charging final image (hollow behind screen), yet spatial choreography lacks tactical constraints—Elara's movements feel unanchored. Sensory details vivid but fail to narrow options during critical beats like the transfer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes clear (save love before demolition) with legible cost, but escalation isn't driven by protagonist agency; the "My dearest" clue emerges passively. Band guardrail met for cost charging final image, yet tightening lacks the visible trade-offs required for 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through interstitial spaces metaphor without moralizing; final line ("forgotten lyric finally found its tune") reweights opening with conceptual cost. Avoids thematic echo but abstract "love storage" concept slightly dilutes concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in spatially imaginative descriptions ("living geometry of longing"), with rhythm modulating to psychic intensity. No POV drift, though "vault of yearning" abstraction momentarily fractures character-particular lens under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion and density; "hushed thunder" motif recurs with purpose. Minor abstraction in "liquid light" metaphor creates slight dissonance against "pulsing heartbeat" orbs, but closure image ("gentle warmth in chest") remains crystal clear without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of film technology and emotional archaeology feels inevitable; "love in film gaps" transforms tropes through specific mechanics. Risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry—demolition threat makes interstitial spaces conceptually urgent and irreplaceable.</comment>
