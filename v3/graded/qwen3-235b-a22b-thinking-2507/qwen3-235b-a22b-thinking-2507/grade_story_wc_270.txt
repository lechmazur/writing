<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (honoring tradition while rejecting stagnation) drive every micro-choice; embodied emotion peaks when she "felt the land’s pain as her own" during bulldozer incursion. Final renunciation of passive waiting earns visible cost through elders' continued "insurgent" label despite land's validation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Flawless causal closure: Elara’s unsealing creates Earned Stasis where tradition evolves through action, not waiting. Cost crystallizes in "elders might call her insurgent still, but the land called her necessary"—social rejection weighed against ecological validation, with irreversible hybrid growth as tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Hot springs function as active constraint (heat intensifying at central vent) and resource (mineral waters awakening insight). Final image of the shoot "waving in the breeze, already taller" charges the setting with renewal, while reeds translating script prove environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation is pure causal agency: bulldozers crushing shoots force urgency, then vent heat physically narrows options. Cost is undeniable—"elders might call her insurgent still" juxtaposed with land’s validation—reconfiguring tradition’s meaning through the hybrid plant’s irreversible emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "implanted destiny" shifts from passive prophecy ("sealed within ancient embryo") to active tending ("a seed she could tend"), with the obsidian-leaved hybrid plant offering non-literal resolution. No moralizing; cost is embodied in social rejection versus ecological necessity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines via plant-telepathy filter ("ferns sighed," "reeds hum"), with rhythm tightening under pressure ("She waded deeper, the heat intensifying"). No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly from observational ("Elara, the insurgent grandmother") to embodied ("steam rising like spectral hands").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero artifacts: "gnarled as ancient roots" shows not tells, and "spectral hands" steam metaphor serves mystical tone without muddling. Only minor deduction: opening line’s "scarred landscape" slightly generic, but quickly redeemed by bulldozer-induced specificity. Final line’s propulsion is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through botanical specificity—the obsidian-leaved hybrid plant embodies tradition evolving with present necessity. Risk-taking (plant telepathy as plot engine) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making the premise inseparable from Elara’s insurgent identity.</comment>
