<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in grafting precision versus emotional vulnerability; tears for the lagoon (not father) reveal unearned forgiveness as active struggle. Coin’s red thread embodies micro-choice: drilling it repurposed guilt into vow. No secondary character limits relationship dynamics but single-POV baseline fully met.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: harmonic hum crystallizes "scars singing" through resonant reconfiguration. Tears and "lagoon that chose to heal" show felt emotional cost while father’s platitude reweights meaning. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density shift at hum revelation tightens the dominant stake (proof of renewal) without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Volcanic black sand constrains choice (grafting medium) and charges closure (clinging to fingers as "beauty from devastation"). Obsidian lagoon’s glassy surface mirrors clouds, evolving with plot to reflect "whole and unbroken" harmony. Sensory specificity ("kelp-drift peace," "ground starlight" grit) filters through firefighter’s tactile expertise without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens: cloud migration’s shifting shadows deepen the stake (proving scars sing) until harmonic hum forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—"tears for the lagoon" not father, coin’s pulse as "second heartbeat." Agency drives escalation: her grafting precision enables the hum’s revelation, avoiding coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through grafting action and harmonic hum, not platitude. Final image ("scars didn’t just heal—they harmonized") reweights "scars can sing" as resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids false equivalence—father’s sin remains unredemptive while land’s healing earns complexity through volcanic grit’s "testament to resilience."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: firefighter’s "calloused hands" notice soil texture, not clouds. Rhythmic control under pressure—"sweat traced her temple, but she remained motionless"—avoids syntactic monotony. Elision (prison glass memory) taught early via coin, paid off when red thread "pulses like second heartbeat" at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beat; "harmonic hum rising from reeds" avoids therapy-speak. Minor overwriting risk in "volcanic grit cold and fine as ground starlight" but justified by character-specific awe. Final line’s "scars harmonized" delivers propulsion without muddle. No closure-adjacent artifacts preserve Q7 integrity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic setting transforms redemption trope: black sand as literal bridge between destruction/renewal avoids generic "ashes to beauty." Fresh synthesis in "scars singing" made tangible through reed vibrations. Bold risk—quiet closure with harmonic hum—heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable post-graft.</comment>
