<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear but rooted in abstract duty rather than personal stakes. Final choice (preserving calm) earned through action, yet emotional progression remains surface-level amid crisis ("bottled whisper burning cold" shows embodied urgency but no layered conflict).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: frost patterns and rustling awakenings escalate pressure through sensory density. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—the library’s irreversible remaking—though "rupture imminent" warning slightly telegraphs the climax prematurely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: frost patterns guide Silas’s choices, cracking branches manifest cost, and the final "new constellations" charge closure. Every detail (condensed starlight ink, glass soil) serves the central conflict without ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly via sensory escalation (rustling to roar, frost to rupture), with Silas’s agency driving each turn. Conceptual cost—reality permanently altered—is legible in "glass branches cracking" and the library’s "new, negotiable form," avoiding abstract declarations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: bottled whisper "revealing fault lines" reweights reality’s fragility without moralizing. Final image of constellations answers the eternity-compression question through charged specifics, though the frost-pattern resolution leans slightly tidy for full 9.0.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in frost-pattern reading and rustling awakenings, but "reconfigure meaning" slips into analytical diction. Rhythmic control excels during rupture ("deafening crescendo," "sigh like a held breath released"), though minor register drift in reflective moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "printed mirrors reflecting cloud sea" achieves high-density propulsion. One near-duplicate ("destabilizing perfect systems" phrasing) slightly dulls momentum, but final line’s "new constellations" crystallizes closure with textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: letterpress operator compressing eternity via printed mirrors transforms time-capture tropes. "Bottled whisper as silver sound" and negotiable reality feel inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
