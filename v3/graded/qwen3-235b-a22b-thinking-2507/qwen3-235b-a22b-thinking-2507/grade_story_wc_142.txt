<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory impulses (mediate vs protect) act simultaneously in scene; final choice to reorganize is earned by his shock absorber role with visible cost ("they won't stop privatization"). No diagnostic label-speak even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "Aethel, reorganized and anchored by memory, would endure" crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds via graffiti pattern density increase; cost legible in "fragile but fierce" hope flickering amid inevitability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (pressing it into Elara's hand) and charges final image (glowing net encircling symbol). Sensory details filtered through Kael's "orderly intuitive" bias ("spotting subtle fractures beneath glittering surface").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael's agency decoding graffiti pattern to propose reorganization. Cost is visible ("they won't stop privatization") and shapes Earned Stasis closure. Dominant stake (community survival) signaled early via "slow seep" gentrification imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image (woven net around stone symbol) offers non-literal answer to "how to resist?" without moralizing. Theme emerges through concrete action ("absorb the shock by becoming the foundation") rather than abstraction; complexity maintained via Kael's "reluctant understanding" of developers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("orderly intuitive nature made him adept at spotting subtle fractures") with rhythmic control under pressure. Sentence variation accelerates during high-stakes decoding ("graffiti pattern: locations converging near the old lighthouse buoy").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "neon-green graffiti bled across the hull" shows textural specificity. Figurative language ("gentrification wasn't a sudden storm; it was a slow seep") serves theme without muddling. Final line recharges motif with "pulse of resistance".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope through specific setting (raft city carnival) and fresh angle (reorganization vs resistance). "Culture shock absorber" role feels newly conceived; risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
