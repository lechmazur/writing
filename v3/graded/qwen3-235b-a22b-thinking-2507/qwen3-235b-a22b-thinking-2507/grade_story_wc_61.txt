<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mourned each fading hue yet cherished their ephemeral beauty," but "throat tightened" lacks embodied specificity. Micro-choice of slotting the gear reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost during seed dispersal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with grandmother's echo response and crystallized tears. Orientation anchors immediately, though verbatim repetition of "quiet sigh of falling petals" slightly dulls closure's momentum under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Nebula garden functions as active micro-setting: ionized petals constrain movement, density measurements dictate path. The gear charges the final image through "weight of infinity in its finite form," meeting 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when sonar pings intensify near desolation ("Will this soil remember life?"). Protagonist agency drives escalation via gear adjustment, with crystallized tears providing unmistakable cost under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "light shared without fire is light that lasts" resonates via scattered seeds, not moralizing. Final image reweights "troubling serenity" as promise kept without stated moral, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "petals of ionized stardust, delicate as cosmic lace" with rhythmic control during sonar pulses. Minor register drift in "heart aching for cycles" slightly disrupts voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Two scaffold loops weaken momentum: verbatim repetition of "quiet sigh of falling petals" and near-synonym use of "generational patterns." First-third density issues ("transit the garden to share light without fire") trigger -0.4 deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms space opera tropes through specific constraints (fireless light), with gear repurposed from war machine as fresh inflection. "Crystallized tears" borders on cliché but earns emotional truth through context.</comment>
