<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "doubt became clarity" and micro-choices like carving the cork circle; embodied chill of realization avoids diagnostic labels; final indexing choice earned by ink-bleed evidence with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in "decisive heartbeat" stamp sound; Accumulative lens holds through ink-pattern escalation; orientation solid by 40 words but "dappled resolve" slightly muddies final image clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Waterlogged ledger and brass stamp constrain choices (candlelight analysis, ink tests) and charge final image; sunken library pressure evident but oak table/cork lack specific closure integration for 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs fabrication) escalate via her methodical ink/pressure analysis; agency drives tightening to single choice (indexing forgeries separately) with felt cost (emotional chill); "dappled resolve" phrasing slightly over-tells tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through ink-bleed evidence, not abstraction; final stamp "heartbeat" reweights "honest origins" without moralizing; avoids sentimentality but "resilient communities" phrasing edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "traced fingers," "guttering flame"; rhythm modulates with focus intensity; "dappled resolve" repetition weakens rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No closure artifacts; high density in ink-analysis beats; "tranquilly perceptive" overuse and "dappled resolve" near-synonym churn in final third prevent 8.8+ despite strong propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transforms historian trope through physical evidence (water-damaged ink); fresh in ink-bleed forensics; "serpent-sun" stamp slightly archetypal but specificity in pressure-point testing elevates.</comment>
