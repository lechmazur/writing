<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (grief for erasure vs. hope in transmission) manifest physically in the locket’s cold-to-warm shift and the vellum handoff, with embodied cost in "haunted euphoria." No therapy-speak; flaws (isolation) compound her urgency without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the girl taking the vellum crystallizes options (memory’s persistence vs. demolition) with undeniable cost in "sharp grief warring with soaring joy." Accumulative lens holds—density peaks in the lupine transfer, reweighting stakes through proximate causes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The walnut ink and vellum function as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s preservation tactics (kneeling to press lupines) and charging the final image (damp ink symbolizing continuity). Sensory details like "faint scent trapped in fibers" reflect her archivist bias without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when teens arrive—not coincidence resolving conflict but complicating it—forcing Elara’s agency in the vellum handoff. Cost is unmistakable: the "sharp grief of what was already lost" forecloses saving the jetty, narrowing options to transmission alone under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the pressed lupine’s "fragile architecture" becomes the non-literal answer to "regenerated covenant," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("blooming jetty sighing... alive with ghosts") reweights prior material without stating a moral, embracing complexity through embodied resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "walnut ink staining fingertips like earth-born constellations," reflecting her archivist lens. Rhythmic control deepens under pressure—fragmented syntax during the handoff ("Keep it," Elara whispered) contrasts lyrical twilight descriptions, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "bruised purples and fading gold" avoids purple prose through specificity. One borderline abstraction ("haunted euphoria") lacks full embodiment but doesn’t dull closure. Zero loops; every sentence (e.g., "cold against her palm") advances character or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "save historic place" trope via walnut-ink specificity and proximate causes mechanics. Emotional truth in "small moments" avoids sentimentality; the lupine’s scent trapped in vellum fibers creates freshness through verifiable detail, not quirky ornament.</comment>
