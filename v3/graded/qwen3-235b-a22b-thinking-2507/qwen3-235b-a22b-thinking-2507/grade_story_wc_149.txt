<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost bride’s motivation manifests through action: reviving vine while blackening thorns embodies "healing and harm." Silas’ embodied grief ("tears freezing on his cheeks") avoids therapy-speak. Backstory fragment anchors present stakes without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: her dissolution against the orchard’s revival. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density peaks at "chord that shook the greenhouse," reweighting stakes via the bead’s inert final state. Orientation clear by line 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse constrains choices: frost on roof forces action; "alchemical nectar" sensory detail reflects urgency. Final image of warm bead charges closure, fulfilling 9+ gate. Moon-blooms’ trembling petals mirror Silas’ internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (orchard’s survival vs. her dissolution) tightens through her thinning form. Agency-driven escalation: "Her fingers closed around the bead" crystallizes the trade-off. Cost undeniable in "dissolving like smoke in wind" against vibrant blooms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "lovingly venomous" vine scene embodies debt’s paradox. Final "mournful elation" reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—no character states the thesis; resonance built from the bead’s transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "breath fogging the cold air" filters setting through Silas’ body. Rhythmic control intensifies at climax ("pure and deep as a bell"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during her veil lift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid gold" root-light image propels closure. Final line’s "lovingly venomous grace" recharges motif without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally ("Silas fell to his knees, tears freezing on his cheeks" compresses emotional weight).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms ghost trope via alchemical rules: "resonant awakenings" create fresh moral calculus. Emotional specificity in "mournful elation" avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure’s cost.</comment>
