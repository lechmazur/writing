<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (report vs. heal) drive choices, but "self-respect demanded" labels motivation; embodied tail-tip revelation saves it. Final choice earned through tactile micro-choices like electrolyte preparation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: chameleon drinking at dawn crystallizes cost with white tail tip against wood. Orientation clear by line 3; BRR reflection stays anchored to crate/water actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Workshop mist enables electrolyte solution; tail tip constrains diagnosis. "Fractured emeralds" refracts light to charge closure image. Avoids white-room syndrome through tool-specific actions (ventilated crate, shallow dish).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake tightening via tail injury transforms abstract ethical dilemma into visceral proof. Cost legible in muted chameleon colors and Elara's shed "dirty film" of trust. Agency in crate/water choices drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tail-tip motif, but "self-respect born of action" states moral in final paragraph. Would score higher if resilience shown solely through chameleon's color shift without explanatory line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "scent of damp cedar and starlight" filters through handler's expertise. Rhythm modulates from "hollow ache" staccato to dawn's "shimmering stillness" cadence. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "jewel-bright eyes like fractured emeralds" avoids mixed metaphor. "First layer/Second layer" cadence risks template but pays off with crate/water actions. Final image propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms wildlife smuggling trope through specific electrolyte misting and tail-tip diagnosis. "Shedding layers" metaphor integrates organically with chameleon biology. Avoids safety-middle via unflinching injury detail.</comment>
