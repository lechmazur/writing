<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s micro-choices (pocketing locket, waiting on bench) reveal layered motivation; secondary characters apply pressure through testimony, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mailbox opening crystallizes community reconnection with visible cost (Rajan’s unsent letters), driven by causal linkage ("she wanted to prove listening heals").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The locket and courtyard constrain choices (key insertion, neighbor gathering) and charge the final image; "sandstorm calm" reweights stakes through tactile dew/bougainvillea, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing through listening) tightens via neighbor testimonies, but escalation lacks a tangible cost before closure; pressure coheres yet options narrow too neatly without mid-beat friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from "letters tied with faded ribbon," not moralizing; final image reweights "listening" as communal thread against despair without stated moral, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in thrift-store curator details ("objects held whispers"), but dialogue converges slightly in emotional peaks (e.g., all neighbors tear up uniformly).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("tarnished edge of the locket," "gritty sigh" of lock), but minor scaffold in "serene now, dew glistening" slightly dulls momentum before climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of thrift-store curator + neighborhood storytelling transforms "mystery object" trope; specificity of monsoon crop failure and landslide grounds emotional truth beyond generic healing.</comment>
