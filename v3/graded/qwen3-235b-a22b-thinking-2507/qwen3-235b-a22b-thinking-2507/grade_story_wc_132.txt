<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "mistaken patience for stubbornness" admission; embodied emotion via pocketed leaf and soil-loosening micro-choice. Avoids diagnostic labels despite high-stakes shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "surrender wasn’t defeat" crystallizes the cost of relinquished control. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the gold ripple’s "slow, deliberate unfurling."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mossy trellis actively constrains choices—compacted soil she "fortified" becomes the physical manifestation of control she must loosen. Rain-soaked earth charges the final image of transformation thriving "because she’d ceased reconstructing."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs. surrender) tightens via soil-loosening action with visible cost: her "method shifting from command to invitation." Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens culminates in the linden’s "reluctant" metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "scattered the copper-edged leaf among the roots, a token of trust" reweights "reconstructing nature’s blueprint" without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer to "quiet revolutions happening in the soil."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "petrichor of decaying leaves" and "veins tracing patterns like faded constellations." Rhythmic control peaks during transformation: "ripple of gold spread... slow, deliberate unfurling" modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density in "dew-laden fronds brushed her shoulders, releasing the petrichor." Strategic figurative language ("emerald velvet moss") avoids muddle. Final line’s "nursery breathe on its own" recharges motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "reluctant plant" trope through specific horticultural stakes and "circuitously sincere" flaw. Fresh synthesis: surrender as "deepest form of study" feels inevitable yet unobvious, heightening emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
