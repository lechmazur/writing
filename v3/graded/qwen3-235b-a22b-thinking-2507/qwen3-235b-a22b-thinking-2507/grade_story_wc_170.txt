<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in embodied action ("fingers brushed the cool, wet parapet"), but lacks contradictory impulses; widower’s visceral tears provide crucial emotional specificity where painter’s calm risks flatness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as mirages dissolve yet "possibilities could never be entirely unseen," with undeniable cost in the widower’s tears; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the bell’s shatter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism parapet actively constrains choice (modulating lullabies via crystalline structure) and charges the final image ("scent of rain... fleeting silhouette"), transforming setting into essential pressure point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the widower’s vision crystallizing the dominant conflict, but escalation leans slightly on external bell timing rather than pure protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final line reweights theme through concrete image ("possibilities... never entirely unseen") without moralizing; avoids sentimentality by rooting hope in the widower’s embodied tears, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("refracting dying light into fleeting rainbows") and rhythmic control under pressure; "near-whisper" lullaby vibrates through stone, teaching elision that pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sugar in warm tea" dissolution achieves high density without muddle. One hairline slip: "dusky harmony" slightly overwrites garden description without altering stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Synthesizes scientific precision ("minor third," "crystalline structure") with poetic hope into fresh emotional truth; "borrowed heartbeat" mechanism avoids trope through tangible cost in the widower’s reaction.</comment>
