<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction (scholarly calm vs. desperate urgency) manifests in embodied micro-choices like grabbing the 'E' loaf and repurposing baskets, earning her pivotal rescue decision through consistent historical motivation without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "not tonight; tonight, the dying arts lived on" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (ongoing thaw vs. temporary victory), holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through density escalation in the hearth scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bread baskets—micro-setting object—constrain choice by repurposing ritual into rescue vessels, charging the final image where "baskets shaped like the letters of a home" fuse environment and identity under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thaw-driven escalation narrows options via Elara’s agency (rallying elders), with the visceral cost of melting vaults made legible in "the ancient ice weeping steady streams," tightening stakes through physical consequence rather than abstract dread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: repurposed bread baskets transform remembrance into survival, offering a resonant non-literal answer to cultural erasure without moralizing, as the final image reweights hope against "rosewater dread."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in curator-specific details ("emerald-tinted opera glass," "bioluminescent moss-light"), with rhythmic compression during panic ("boots splashing in newly formed puddles") maintaining voice coherence under stress.</comment>
