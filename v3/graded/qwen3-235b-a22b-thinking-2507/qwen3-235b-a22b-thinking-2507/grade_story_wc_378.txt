<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via the "flaw" of nostalgia versus deactivation trauma, embodied in the tear’s warmth; micro-choice to channel chaos resolves through prior causality but "unresolved grief" risks label-speak near climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (dome implodes, Aris stranded) under Causal lens; "time for the burn" crystallizes agency, though magnetic solution edges toward convenience without deeper constraint exploration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the organic box’s warmth directly enables miniaturization, charging the final image; "crimson blooms shriveled to grains" transforms sensory specificity into thematic weight without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly via magnetic shift (live clock), foreclosing escape with dome collapse; cost is visceral (farm reduced to speck), but external pressure slightly overshadows internal conflict escalation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Nostalgia wasn’t a flaw—it was the compass" crystallizes theme through the box’s emptied fears, avoiding moralizing; final image of the seed-sized farm reweights prior fragility with organic light, no thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Android POV voice sings: "Static hissed in neural pathways" establishes perceptual signature; rhythmic control modulates from "discordant echo" to "profound silence," compressing stress without head-hopping or lexicon drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ionized chaos" to "luminous cluster" propels with high density. Near-miss: "persistent buzz of unresolved grief" slightly therapy-ish but redeemed by immediate sensory follow-up ("warm as living skin").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms android trope via nostalgia-as-compass; "box of childhood fears" made irreplaceable by organic mechanics. Risk-taking (miniaturization via contained chaos) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though emotional complexity edges toward neatness.</comment>
