<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (urgency vs reverence) act in scene; final choice to translate names earned by embodied childhood memory with visible cost in "weight of gratitude." No label-speak; throat tightening at uncle's script shows authentic emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: ledger unfastening forecloses oblivion with felt cost ("weight of gratitude"), legible in final line about anchoring future tides. Accumulative lens holds—density increase across paintings tightens options under protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lens fragment (micro-setting) constrains all choices—must press it against paintings to reveal glyphs/logs—then charges final image as "tangible thread." Market height ("suspended between smokestacks") mirrors thematic tension, avoiding white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens: each painting's revelation narrows options (coordinates → logs → transmissions), with agency-driven escalation. Cost is unmistakable—"throat tightened" at uncle's script, culminating in ledger's "weight of gratitude."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally: "anchors of intuition" redefined through concrete action (fragment revealing transmissions), culminating in resonant closure where honoring histories "makes an instant eternal"—no moralizing, pure image-driven repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waves resolved as liquid shadow") and rhythmic control under pressure; compression of grandmother's voice taught early and pays off. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sigh like retreating tide" achieves high density without muddle. Final line recharges lens motif with precision ("tangible thread connecting grandmother’s stories"), avoiding figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through specific "between-worlds translator" lens; emotional truth in honoring erased labor avoids abstraction. Fresh inflection: light as "grammar for the lost," earned through ledger's tangible names.</comment>
