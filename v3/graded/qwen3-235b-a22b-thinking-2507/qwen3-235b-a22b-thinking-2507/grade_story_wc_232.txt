<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (loneliness vs. quest resolve) embodied through tactile micro-choices like scraping knuckles in crevice. Epiphany lacks sufficient struggle; "no longer lonely" assertion needs more embodied cost during flood's arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: creek flooding dislodges the chip, cutting the vision short. "Icy fingers of the rising creek seeped into the chamber" makes the physical/emotional cost legible under causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Creek's rise actively constrains choices (forcing ant-path follow, chip insertion under duress) and charges the final image. Bioluminescent fungi aren't just atmosphere—they guide the path when lantern fails, directly shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: rising water narrows options from exploration to survival, culminating in the chip's dislodgement. Cost is visceral—the vision's abrupt end forces endurance (Earned Stasis) with the damp chip as tangible proof of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the chip dislodging by floodwater reweights "doorway" as internal clarity, not escape. Avoids moralizing; final image ("map of his own making") resonates without stating the lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct cartographer's perceptual signature ("traced cold grooves," "rhythmic movement on cavern floor") modulates under pressure. Slight register drift in "empirically intuitive" during climax risks academic tone but stays voice-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "swollen creek" motif evolves from path to threat without redundancy. Final line ("carrying the map of his own making") recharges the opening bell-polishing with conceptual cost, avoiding closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms quest tropes via specific cartographic lens: ants as guides and bioluminescent pressure create fresh emotional truth. Risk-taking (vision over physical door) heightens stakes without gimmickry, making loneliness resolution inevitable.</comment>
