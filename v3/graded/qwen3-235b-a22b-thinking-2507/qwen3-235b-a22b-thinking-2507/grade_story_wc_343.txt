<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "sociable isolation" transforms from pang to purpose via embodied micro-choices (crouching, charcoal notation). Flawed competence in dismissing hopscotch as "childhood games" until dog-ear clue; tears-to-smile shift earned by "sweet with purpose" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: triangulation forecloses passive waiting with visible cost (enduring isolation becomes "sweet with purpose"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure deepens through pattern density (murmurations→hopscotch→phrasebook), narrowing focus to 11-second rhythm. Cost legible in "tears pricked her eyes as she packed."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: hopscotch board’s chalk lines directly enable triangulation. Final image ("hopscotch board... a lens") charges closure by reframing isolation as perception. Antique airship’s brass railing and grime aren’t backdrop—they shape tactile discovery (calloused fingers tracing, dirt brushing).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: noting patterns abandons passive waiting for active observation. Cost is visceral ("sociable isolation now sweet with purpose"), but phrasebook dog-ear’s convenience slightly undermines escalation—feels like plot amnesia that the cipher wasn’t spotted earlier despite her curiosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "stranded luminance wasn’t a trap—it was a beacon" dramatized by starlings revealing Solis Aeternus. Final murmuration "bow" reweights opening "spilled ink" imagery without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in ledger notation ("stranded luminance" as charted discovery, not abstract lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: map-apprentice precision in "noted how starlings echoed intervals." But filter verb "felt" in "she felt the familiar pang" slightly dulls immediacy during peak stress. Voice modulates perfectly from lonely observation to triumphant notation ("hand steady despite chill").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minor scaffolding: "diligently curious" label repeats redundantly near end. Overuse of "stranded luminance" (4x) risks thematic echo, but final image’s "beacon waiting to be read" redeems it. No closure artifacts—prose propulsion intact during triangulation ("Square three: starlings spiraled...").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hopscotch as celestial cipher transforms navigation tropes through specific mechanics (11-second rhythm, wedge formations). Transformation test fails—swap "airship" for "spaceship" and brass railing’s tactile grit breaks the discovery. Bold risk: using birds as guides feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
