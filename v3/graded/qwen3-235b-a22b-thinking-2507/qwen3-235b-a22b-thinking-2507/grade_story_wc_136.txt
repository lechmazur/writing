<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (mapping others vs. avoiding his grief) drives the climax; embodied emotion in "pressed the punch into his palm" avoids therapy-speak. Backstory integration slightly summary-like when mother's voice echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: dissolving arrows at dawn and whispered confession reconfigure the fortress as internal reckoning. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through pattern escalation to the vial chamber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Phantom punch constrains every choice (marking cracks, activating marble) and charges the final image when used on his palm. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmosphere to active narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting buried guilt) tightens through Elias's agency—each punch decision escalates pressure. Dawn's dissolution of arrows provides visible cost that forecloses the mapped path with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through vial imagery: "swirling mist shaped like words" avoids moralizing. Final blank vial filling with light offers resonant answer to "how do we carry guilt?" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in cartographer's details ("arrows grew sharper near churches"), but "trembling certainty" borders on abstraction. Voice modulates effectively from analytical to raw during confession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop in opening ("analytically artistic rendering... seeking the fortress"). Climax prose remains clean and propulsive—"pressed the punch into his palm" avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden truth" trope through cartographic lens; phantom punch feels fresh and necessary. Emotional specificity in "I stopped visiting her" avoids generic templates.</comment>
