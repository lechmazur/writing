<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through tactile details ("cool silk of vanished afternoon"), but "invented histories" label risks over-articulation during peak stress; embodied contradiction (studious focus vs. aching connection) earns high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: tears of "profound connection" and the gilded leaf's fragility reconfigure her stance; Accumulative lens holds as hum intensifies then fades, tightening the temporal gathering imperative without causal shortcuts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bonsai functions as essential micro-setting: its vibrating wood enables the cherry blossom resonance shift and charges the final image ("blooming labyrinth"); "dew-slick miniature bark" specificity constrains her tactile methodology while avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her agency: adjusting the grid to capture the hum's resonance directly narrows her options as the scent dissolves; the visceral cost ("tears... not of sorrow") legibly forecloses passive observation, though moral calculus could deepen slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—charting vibration as temporal coordinates—not abstraction; the final image ("gathering scattered textures... one invented history at a time") resonantly answers how to endure silence without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in stationer-specific texture metaphors ("rough grit of forgotten argument"), though "incandescent restraint" momentarily drifts into elevated diction during the climax beat, slightly diluting voice consistency under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "vibrating in her molars" exemplifies textural density, but early repetition of "studiously earnest" creates minor synonym churn that just misses flawless propulsion in the setup.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes through sensory specificity (charting hum as temporal coordinates); the "gilded-leaf stationer" concept synthesizes fragility and precision in a non-obvious way that heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
