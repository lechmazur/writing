<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'") is concrete and tied to conductor's dismissal, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses—yearning dominates without competing doubts. Hitchhiker serves as thematic device rather than character, weakening relationship-as-crucible. Final descent choice feels unearned; no visible struggle between hope and risk before acting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (mountain pullout, vanished hitchhiker), and closure achieves Charged Poise with mossy bow proving "broken things grow anew." But tarp's "secret route" emerges too late without prior setup—railroad signal logic feels retrofitted, undermining Accumulative escalation. Cost (shale descent, conductor's verdict crumbling) is legible but lacks felt stakes during pivotal descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tarp's flutters constrain choice by mapping the path, and micro-setting (shale slope) directly alters tactics—hidden ledge found via wind patterns. Final moss-glowing bow charges closure with environmental specificity. Some decorative details ("indigo sky") dilute pressure, but canyon setting consistently shapes action and meaning without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving "never" wrong) tightens when tarp reveals path, forcing descent. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—the tarp "pulsed like a heartbeat" rather than his choice driving pressure. Cost (physical danger) feels nominal; shale shifts but ledge appears conveniently, missing visceral trade-off required for high-band escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" evolves organically from abstract concept to concrete moss regrowth, avoiding moralizing. Final bow image resonates as non-literal answer to "can broken things be mended?" Hitchhiker's dialogue edges toward thematic echo ("valley where broken things remade"), but subtext in moss and glass shard earns complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV filters everything through fiddler's sensory precision ("tarp like nervous bird’s wing"), with rhythm shifting from lyrical observation to staccato descent. "Luminous disbelief" repeats as tic, and "ghost of violin notes" slightly drifts into elevated diction. No head-hopping; compression (hitchhiker's vanishing) taught early and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose density stumbles in high-pressure beats: "fading sun turning flutters into luminous glyphs" overwrites tension. Template cadence ("He was... In his palm... Earlier...") and filter verbs ("he saw," "he traced") dull immediacy. Final bow lift ("luminous disbelief flooded") uses label over embodiment, but no artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" as physical concept (shards = pixels of forgiveness) transforms trope through collodion glass and moss regrowth. Risk-taking (lyric structure, vanishing hitchhiker) heightens stakes coherently—moss on bow feels inevitable. Avoids safety middle with specific, verifiable details (wet-plate chemistry, railroad signals) anchoring universals.</comment>
