<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (tears vs. resolve, love vs. necessary distance) drive earned endurance; final bow crystallizes cost without sentimentality. "Featherly determined" repetition slightly flattens trait evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: tears and the bow across the threshold reconfigure stakes under Accumulative lens. Terrace stabilization and father’s reappearance validate pattern accumulation without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace and wooden bench constrain choices (step risk, grain analysis) and charge the final image—bench grain directly dictates the three-pace retreat. Micro-setting elevates beyond atmospheric backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: WX-7 to WX-9 shift reweights "necessary distances" as resonant space, narrowing options to one step. Cost legible in "tears blurred the fractured hush" and the bow’s sacrifice of reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action (bowing honors space), not abstraction. Final image—"fractured hush softened into peace"—resonantly answers "why thresholds feel sacred" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("wood’s whispers," "WX-9 hummed in her bones") sustains under pressure. Rhythmic control varies from staccato ("She breathed shallowly") to lyrical, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("prism terrace drifted like powdered glass" compresses setting/stakes). "Featherly determined" repetition slightly dulls propulsion, but final line recharges opening motif with earned closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "butterfly effect" via weather-coded mazes; emotional truth in separation-as-holiness avoids trope. Fresh inflection: wood grain as hidden adjustment (WX-9) feels inevitable, though "featherly" risks quirkiness.</comment>
