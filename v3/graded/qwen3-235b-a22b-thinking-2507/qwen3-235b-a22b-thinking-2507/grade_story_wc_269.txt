<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied grief in "breath fogging the dive mask" and tapping rhythms reveal contradictory impulses. Micro-choices like smoothing the torn atlas page show active struggle against hopelessness. Final realization earned through assembled evidence, not epiphany. Minor abstraction in "skeletal under merciless sun" avoids diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "etched not in policy but in the bones of the earth" with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds through evidence assembly to revelation. Cost proof clear in "irreversible losses" crystallization. "Periodically eternal" phrasing slightly muddies but redeemed by rhythmic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atlas page and tapping rhythm function as micro-setting, constraining choices during assembly and charging the final "tap... tap... tap" image. Sensory details selective ("bruised twilight," "humming silence") filtered through marine scientist POV. Recurring object (atlas) essential to closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (vanishing paths) tightens through Aris's evidence assembly, with revelation narrowing options to irreversible loss. Agency-driven under accumulative lens via his rhythmic tapping mirroring frustration. Cost legible in "patient still dying in slow cycles." Minor abstraction in "periodically eternal" doesn't obscure stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral scaffolds' fragility and atlas page's physicality, not abstraction. Final image reweights "drifting moored" into Earned Stasis with "irreversible losses" cost. Avoids moralizing; "consequences outlasted causes" earned by rising water imagery. Resonant answer via "bones of the earth" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in scientific-poetic diction ("coral pathways now buried beneath indifferent swell"). Rhythmic control evident in tapping variations mirroring emotional shifts. Compression taught early ("ghostly remains") and paid off in closure. Minor register drift in "periodically eternal" redeemed by embodied payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with multi-jobbing lines ("ocean’s memory remained poisoned" conveys time + consequence). Zero paraphrase loops; sentence openings vary effectively. Minor abstraction in "skeletal under merciless sun" avoided peak-beat damage. Final line "moored station held its vigil" avoids cliché through concrete charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief via vanishing paths rather than reefs themselves. "Periodically eternal" concept transforms time/loss tropes through tapping rhythm and storm surges. Emotional specificity in quiet despair avoids safety middle. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
