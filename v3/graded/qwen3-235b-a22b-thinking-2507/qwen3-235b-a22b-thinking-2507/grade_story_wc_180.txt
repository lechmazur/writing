<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara’s rigid vow-misinterpretation versus orchard’s organic wisdom, embodied when she realizes "vows like leaves must fall." Micro-choices (unraveling ribbon, tracing its path) reveal hierarchy of values with cost—her years of estrangement crystallized in Liora’s arrival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Liora’s "I understand now" crystallizes options with visceral cost (tears, "afraid to shatter the moment"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through ribbon’s reweighted meaning, culminating in the sapling’s graft as reconfigured legacy. Cost proof: "cheeks flushed" and "trembling" voice make emotional price undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: roots cracked the foundation, blossoms drift onto mended glass, and branching patterns echo the ribbon’s weave. Micro-setting (quartz eye, cerulean ribbon) charges closure—silk transforms into "luminous sky," proving environment shapes the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (preserving generational wisdom) tightens via Elara’s agency: frustration → ribbon discovery → epiphany. Cost is felt in the estrangement’s weight ("years believing... pushed Liora away") and Liora’s "trembling" return. Escalation under Accumulative lens reweights stakes through the ribbon’s evolving significance, narrowing options to mending with what’s at hand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade>Thematic resonance emerges purely from particulars: "deciduous vows" shift from legal void to living wisdom in the final image (hands holding ribbon, sapling for grafting). No moralizing—closure’s "humming with accidental truth" reweights the central question without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "quartz eye scanning," "pawed through satchel," "feisty persistence" filter all observation. Rhythmic control peaks in climax—"Liora watched her, cheeks flushed, a new sapling cradled"—compressing emotional weight without losing voice. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shrinks perfectly under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("unraveled," "threaded," "secured"). Figurative language ("cobalt silk transforming into a luminous sky") serves Accumulative lens without muddle. Final line’s "humming with accidental truth" charges closure with crystalline specificity—no weak modifiers or redundant stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms estrangement trope through "deciduous vows" as organic wisdom system. Freshness in quartz eye’s precision enabling ribbon-weave recognition, and legal breach reframed as necessary evolution. Risk-taking (Accumulative structure) heightens stakes—closure’s quiet sapling graft feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
