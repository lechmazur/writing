<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine in micro-choices (trembling hand vs calm voice), but "broken promises heal" edges toward thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("he didn’t know if Kael would hear"), though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Causal hybrid) nearly breaches the 8.8 gate until final image reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade’s physical decay and brittle hush actively constrain choices (sensor gaps, reboot timing); the thunderstorm bottle’s micro-setting charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Aris’s agency (uncorking the bottle), but secondary cost ("Deviation noted") lacks visceral weight beyond plot consequence, limiting the 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "space between absences" reprise without moralizing, though "where broken promises heal" risks abstraction before Elara’s concrete blue tiles anchor it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cobalt glass reflecting bruised orange sky") and rhythmic control under pressure; zero head-hopping despite tense standoff with drones.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("contained lightning"/"contained storm calming") triggers −0.2, but propulsion and cadence shifts during drone launch exemplify peak-beat control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "absences" as connective tissue elevates war-smuggling trope, though cobalt aesthetic borders on familiar post-apocalyptic shorthand without deeper transformation.</comment>
