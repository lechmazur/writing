<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("therapy vs rebellion") stated but not dramatized through micro-choices; drumming shifts from agency to symptom when overload occurs. Emotional progression lacks visible tradeoffs during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: "Elara remained perched... utterly still" crystallizes cost of the hollow ache. Machine overload slightly convenient but cost ("echo of auroral sorrow") is legible on final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound wave garden constrains every choice—the resonators translate drumming into lagoon vision, then fail. Final console image ("silent," "cold metal") charges closure by mirroring lost warmth, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through drumming intensity → lagoon appearance → neural overload, but protagonist agency falters during climax (machine forces collapse). Cost is visceral but escalation leans slightly on coincidence rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "sterile erasure" vs "quietly rebellious act," culminating in the final image’s "hollow ache of what could never be." Avoids moralizing but "rebellion" label slightly overstates subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: drumming "rhythm only she and dying stars understood" and collapsing syntax during overload ("frantic, joyful rhythm") reflect mental state. Rhythmic control under pressure teaches pattern early with no POV slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("doctors dismissed... but Elara knew better") slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or figurative muddle; "auroral sorrow" risks purple prose but fits voice. Final line’s "hollow ache" delivers crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tech: drumming as memory retrieval avoids sci-fi clichés through emotional specificity ("liquid gold" lagoon). Transformation test passed—would collapse with generic "shared dream" instead of sensory auric details.</comment>
