<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (belief in randomness vs stellar doubt) act simultaneously; final choice earned through distillation process. Minor deduction: emotional shift to certainty slightly under-embodied in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolved doubt becoming certainty). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through static distillation; pressure tightens via interference resistance. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coins function as micro-setting charging closure (gold token pressed to temple). Ambered deck fossilized resin enables purification ritual. Slight deduction: observatory doesn't actively constrain choices beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (colony survival through alignment) escalate via static's resistance deepening doubt. Agency-driven resolution (prism adjustment) with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction: conceptual cost needs more physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through static rhythms matching star pulses; final image reweights "purpose wakes" as resonance without moralizing. Avoids binaries by framing alignment as struggle, not triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientific-poetic diction: "birth cries," "wavelength aligning"). Rhythmic control shifts from fragmented doubt to lyrical certainty. Patterned elision (unseen colony) taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; high density ("peeling layers of static like onion skins" justified by context). Minor deduction: "flickered like dying embers" slightly echoes later "false promises" imagery in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: universe contraction reframed through resonance physics. Emotional truth in doubt-to-certainty arc avoids post-apocalyptic clichés. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
