<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via "resiliently positive" stance versus trembling urgency; micro-choices like radio knob adjustments reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance choice lacks visible cost escalation beyond stated motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("hollowness now a promise of time remade"). Orientation clear by line 5; Accumulative/Textural lens held through pattern-based resolution. Minor cost legibility gap in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spectral grotto’s sideways clocks and tide pools constrain choices (radio tuning via starlight patterns) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy sharpens under pressure—crystal walls vibrating to horn blasts. No white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (merging timelines) tightens through Leo’s pattern recognition under pressure. Agency-driven escalation via radio adjustments and horn sequence. Cost—permanent guardianship—felt but not viscerally paid on page during climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "light between fractures" motif reweighted by empty hourglass. Avoids moralizing until final line’s thematic echo ("chance to rebuild") triggers -0.6 penalty. Subtext in overlapping radio voices shows competing timelines’ cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "clocks ran sideways like trapped moths" and stress-compressed diction ("static surged, then coalesced"). Radio dialogue carries subtext via distorted echoes. Slight register drift in "transient space demanded constant vigilance."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "liquid starlight" crystallizes density. One near-template cadence ("He scanned... There—the pattern!") at critical beat. Final image’s "resiliently positive against the flow" avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms vanishing-ferry trope through grotto’s geometry-as-map. Specificity in "triple horn blasts" creates freshness. Risk-taking (lyric time physics) heightens stakes without gimmickry; conceptual integrity holds through starlight lattice payoff.</comment>
