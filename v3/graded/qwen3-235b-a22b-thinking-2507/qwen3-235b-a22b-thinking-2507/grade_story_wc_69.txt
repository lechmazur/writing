<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "clenched jaw" and "tremor" shows contradictory impulses. Final choice to prioritize listening over singing is earned by library stillness, but Mateo/Aisha's shift lacks visible cost escalation beyond internal realizations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the resonant silence reconfigures "vanishing arts" with conceptual cost (ongoing labor of subtraction). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory accumulation toward the library concert's charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zither rosette constrains choice (rehearsal method) and charges the final image (sunlight on wood). "Velvet library" micro-setting shapes tactics via its acoustic properties, with sensory details filtered through Ms. Thorne's tactile focus on wood grain and dust motes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Ms. Thorne's agency (shifting from singing to silence), but the cost of "unlearning hatred" remains abstract—no concrete loss (e.g., forfeited performance opportunity) alters tactics. Pressure deepens via sensory accumulation but lacks visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rosette's function: "subtracting noise" reweights empathy as active labor. Avoids moralizing; final image ("silence rich with resonance") offers non-literal answer. Slightly undercut by "vanishing arts" label repeating concept without deepening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("traced the zither soundhole," "dust motes danced") modulates under stress. Voice compresses time ("weeks passed across fragile unlearning") without losing momentum. No POV leakage; psychic distance shifts intentionally during rehearsal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "autumnal gloom" and "traveled stillness" avoid cliché through concrete ties to action. Minor paraphrase loop in "expectantly resigned" phrasing (-0.2), but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line’s rhythm crystallizes the theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "healing choir" trope through specific craft: rosette’s acoustic function becomes metaphor for emotional labor. Bold risk in prioritizing silence over song, with "traveled stillness" redefining harmony. Fresh synthesis of vanishing arts and social fracture feels inevitable.</comment>
