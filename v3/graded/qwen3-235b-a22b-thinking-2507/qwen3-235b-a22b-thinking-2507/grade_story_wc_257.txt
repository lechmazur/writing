<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses ("subdued ardor" amid grief) manifest in micro-choices like tracing the locket frame versus unfolding the stencil. Final renunciation of pure mourning is earned through the origami placements, but emotional shift from rock bottom to action lacks one beat of struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "tears tracing silent paths" crystallizes emotional transformation after the illumination. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory density builds to the lantern beam’s projection, reweighting stakes through the observatory’s tools.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass telescopes and velvet curtains actively constrain choices (aligning coordinates, projecting light), charging the final image. "Emergency lamp" as micro-setting directly enables the climax, avoiding symbolic convenience through tactile precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency—origami placements deepen the "teach withering to bloom" stake, culminating in the lantern illumination. Cost is unmistakable in her rain-lashed doubt and subsequent emotional shift, though secondary pressure from the city’s indifference remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the locket’s evolution from dust to seed promise. Final image of the wildflower-petal lotus reweights "genuinely artificial" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in vellum’s "brittle sheet" and light as "golden warmth," modulating rhythm under pressure ("doubt gnawed" vs. "steady, warm ember"). Minor register drift in "hollow refuge" slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon light") propels momentum. Final line "promise of bloom" recharges the opening dust locket with crystalline clarity, though "cosmic indifference" risks thematic overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through the mourning jewelry maker’s specificity—embedding real seeds in glass orbs avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking (curtains projecting floral light) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "subdued ardor" borders on familiar lyricism.</comment>
