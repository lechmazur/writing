<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: professional calm vs. "quiet sorrow, like holding smoke" embodied in dust analysis and ghost interaction. Final choice (repairing bird) earns catharsis through causal chain, avoiding over-tidiness with visceral cost ("weightless burden" deepening then easing).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is Decisive Change: bird repair frees Thorn with felt cost (burden's weight shift). Causal lens holds flawlessly—"dust arc → barrel → ghost → key → resolution" chain tightens options. Cost proof: "weightless burden in Silas’s chest grew heavier" then eases at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choices: counter height forces climbing for key; dust patterns guide discovery. Ticket office isn't backdrop—the cash drawer, shelf, and ceiling cracks pressure every move. Final image (bird in pocket) charged by prior tool specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single stake (freeing Thorn) escalates causally: barrel discovery → ghost encounter → key search. Silas's agency drives all turns; cost is visible in burden's weight shift. No coincidence—dust analysis enables every choice, narrowing options to one decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "secrets meant to be released, not kept" reweights "ceiling secrets" without moralizing. Final image (silent bird) offers resonant answer to central question—Thorn's release proves some hidden things must be set free, not hoarded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices mechanical details ("circular motion, consistent with winding"). Rhythmic control under pressure—shortened sentences during ghost encounter ("Thorn," he said). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens with tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "weightless burden" motif earns reprise. Minor density dip in "profoundly out of place" (slight register drift) but no closure harm. Final line avoids sentimentality with concrete action: "clockwork bird silent in his pocket."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator tech who sees ghosts as "quiet sorrow" transforms trope. Specificity matters—clockwork bird for granddaughter, dust patterns as ghostly clues. Avoids safety middle with emotional complexity (release as catharsis, not triumph).</comment>
