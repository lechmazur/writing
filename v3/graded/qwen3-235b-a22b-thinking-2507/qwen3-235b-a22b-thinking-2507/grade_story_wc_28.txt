<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("gentle radical") manifests in embodied micro-choices: trembling tessera grasp followed by steel-wrapped calm when confronting Varr. No therapy-speak; "aberrant mercy" thought arises organically from vision's visceral exhaustion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: crews lowering tools proves Varr's stance crystallization. Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through pattern recognition (chipped mosaic → resolved script) with retrocognitive vision deepening knowledge, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tessera constrains choice (fitting fragment) and charges final image (cool ceramic radiating warmth). Plaza's "warm coldness" evolves from paradox to healing threshold, mirroring Kael's internal shift without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: tessera placement transforms abstract "truth" into concrete script, narrowing options (rename or erase). Cost legible in Varr's faltering expression—conceptual price of righteousness crumbling—but secondary pressure from crews slightly dilutes dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "Rahma al-Nasr" revelation: mercy's victory reweights conquest without moralizing. Final image ("threshold" plaza) offers non-literal answer to vengeance cycle, avoiding thematic echo despite Kael's "aberrant mercy" thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "fractures in ancient mosaic" reflects Kael's truth-seeking focus. Voice modulates under pressure—lyric ("shattered sky") tightens during vision ("sobbing woman"). Slight register drift in "retrocognitively trapped" label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" violates POV lexicon with clinical label in peak beat, triggering -0.5 penalty. Otherwise stellar density: "warm coldness" compresses paradox, "arms of steel" motif evolves organically. Final line's "holding their breath" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "archaeological discovery" trope through mosaic-as-encrypted-history. Fresh inflection: mercy shown by soldiers reframes conquest not as binary victory but moral complexity. Risks lyrical compression without gimmickry, though Varr remains underdeveloped.</comment>
