<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserve beauty vs share it) act simultaneously during rope examination; escapee backstory earns final choice without therapy-speak; embodied cost in "pattern of contrasts" realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: rope reweaving crystallizes stance where "time isn’t one thing to be captured"; Accumulative lens holds through pattern-density escalation to slipknot revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Terra-cotta walls function as micro-setting—scraping clay to "feel time’s texture" directly constrains climax choice; rope’s physical properties charge final image as "frayed end glowing softly".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: knot-tying experiment triggers rope vibration; impossible choice (surrender voice vs abandon revelation) reweights with felt cost in her dual-nature realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through rope’s evolving meaning; final question "What texture does freedom wear..." reweights opening texture motif without moralizing, embracing complexity via third-path solution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "fibers whispering secrets," "time as sediment"; rhythmic control under pressure with fragments ("Her breath catches") during climax; no POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "rope trembles... revealing hidden layer" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose; consistent tactile metaphors ("smooth as silk," "rough as shattered pottery") charge closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific constraints: rope’s physical properties (slipknot, fraying) directly shape choices; avoids abstraction through "prison escapee’s discarded trail" verisimilitude.</comment>
