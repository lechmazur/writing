<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fiercely gentle" thumb motion versus "river stone" eyes, but micro-choices lack escalation under pressure; the root trap crystallizes motivation too abruptly without layered hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost ("her own path bound to this place"), but the root trap feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens, missing high-band gate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard’s roots actively constrain choice by pinning Elara at closure, charging the final image, yet fail to shape earlier tactics—environment only pressures during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through root constriction, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; the trap emerges reactively rather than from Elara’s choices, violating Q4’s quick test for Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "inlaying meaning" as futile yet necessary action, culminating in the hummed lullaby—a resonant, non-literal answer to patching soul-holes without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused thumb smoothing brittle corner") and rhythmic control elevate tension, though "dusky resolve settling like a shroud" slightly drifts into cliché during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops with exceptional density ("shattered skulls, their gnarled tips probing ancient dead"), though "ghost of burnt sage" edges toward overwriting without pattern payoff in the final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "bartered destinies" through visceral micro-actions (carving rainwater into roots), avoiding trope clichés; the catacomb orchard’s bone-snaking roots feel freshly inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
