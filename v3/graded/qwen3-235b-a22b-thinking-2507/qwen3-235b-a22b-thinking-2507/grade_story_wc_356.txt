<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (control vs. motion) drive micro-choices; visible cost in abandoned rigidity when seed is left to sway. Final renunciation earned through failed tactics, not abstract epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: density shift from controlled watering to observational journaling reweights serenity's meaning. Cost legible in "frantic herbalist now a vessel" as Charged Poise crystallizes options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting (support beam crevice) constrains choice by enabling growth through natural motion. Final leaf image charges early wood-grain doodles, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by agency: storm destroys rigidity, then observing replaces watering. Cost unmistakable in "ambition to force understanding dissolved" as deepening reweights the stake under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final leaf image ("harmonizing with the sway") answers "serenity within motion" non-literally without moralizing. Theme emerges from corpse flower's inverted symbolism, avoiding binaries through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature (olfactory focus, herbalist lexicon) shapes every description. Rhythmic compression during storm ("Panic seized her") modulates with pressure while maintaining distinct voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "barnacles to a leviathan" establishes setting/metaphor/tone in 7 words. One minor artifact ("tide's thought" slightly ornate) prevents 10.0 but never dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms corpse flower trope via inversion (harmony not decay). Emotional truth in control struggle feels specific, not template-driven; fresh synthesis inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
