<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aris's interiority balances surface grief with scientific rigor; embodied emotion in chain-scraped palm and "quiet intensity" avoids therapy-speak. Kael's skepticism creates status tension but remains underdeveloped as secondary pressure. Final choice to trust edge geometry earns closure through prior calibration acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "cradle" reconfiguration replaces "tomb" through neutrino-starlight integration. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases via hologram expansion and chain/hologram parallels. Cost legible in "weight of motivation crystallize" for surface return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anchor chain constrains choices: tactile calibration of edge geometry and charges final image ("edges smoothed by contemplation"). Micro-setting mastery—iron's roughness mirrors molecular fractures, bioluminescence replaces sunlight. Sensory hierarchy prioritizes touch/light refraction under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (drowned-light navigation for surface return) tighten through Kael's skepticism → calibration adjustment. Escalation via hologram expansion narrows options to "mapping dark's edges." Cost is conceptual: trust in alien data risks repeating surface-chart lies, made legible in "chain's truth" versus "unseen."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through edge geometry's literal/metaphorical duality—"edges between known/unknown" crystallizes in final line. Avoids moralizing; "unfolded horizons" reweights via water-memory navigation. Final image charges motif: chain transitions from "broken ties" to "key," rejecting surface nostalgia for cosmic wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Aris notices molecular light fractures, not decorative bioluminescence. Syntax shifts from measured ("balancedly curious") to urgent ("recalculating as alien data surged"). Dialogue avoids indirection—Kael's "how do we trust it?" directly pressures Aris's core conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; "coral spires" and "hologram branching like coral" avoid redundancy through functional contrast (setting vs. tool). Propulsion via strong verbs: "pulsed," "scraping," "surged." Final line’s "waters that now held the whole sky" achieves textural density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms navigation tropes via quantum-entangled neutrinos and "water's skin" perspective. Emotional truth in Aris’s dual longing—surface grief fuels interstellar curiosity. Avoids abstraction: "edges" concretize epistemological tension. Risk-taking in quiet closure earns +0.3 within band.</comment>
