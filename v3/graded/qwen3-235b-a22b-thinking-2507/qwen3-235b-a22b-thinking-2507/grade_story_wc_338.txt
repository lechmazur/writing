<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "guarded skepticism yet welcomed revelation," embodied through her brush clearing roots. Final choice to leave the vault breathing earns closure with visceral tears mixing rain, avoiding epiphanies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density peaks as light/shadow shifts accumulate toward Charged Poise closure. Cost legible in "tears mixed with rain" and reconciled time, with the henge’s hum charging the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vault fissure constrains every choice—blocking light, sealing resonance—and literally charges the ending when rain seeps in. Sensory specificity ("damp chill," "fogging lens") filters through her map-framer’s professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through sapling obstruction forcing airflow restoration, not excavation. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the brush clearing, with visible cost in her tears and the vault’s weeping frescoes foreclosing division.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Silence is not absence" emerges organically from her actions, not declaration. Final survey note avoids moralizing by framing silence as a map, reweighting the premise through her embodied reconciliation of time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("framer’s eye attuned to minute shifts") shapes every observation. Rhythmic control peaks in the hum’s emergence: "vibrating through her palms" compresses stress without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "dust motes danced in a diagonal shaft" exemplifies layered density. Near-miss: "dissolved them" slightly strains metaphor in high-pressure beat, costing 0.1 despite otherwise flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archaeological trope through acoustic resonance as chapel. Specificity of Super 8 reels and erosion lines makes the "whispered chapel" feel inevitable, with risk-taking in situating closure in vibration over dialogue.</comment>
