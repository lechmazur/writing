<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (seeking truth while projecting fear), embodied via frozen tears and shifting frost patterns. Epiphany earned through tangible prism reactions, though micro-choices during crisis slightly compressed. Final renunciation of identity carries visible cost in "truthful lies" collapse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "tears froze" crystallizes identity loss while softened frost mirrors humility. Accumulative lens holds—frost pattern breaks escalate pressure relentlessly. Cost proof evident in "foundation of truthful lies" with final image reconfiguring stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frost patterns function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure—evolving from "fractals" to fear-mirroring lattice to "gentle spirals" as her certainty melts. Prism’s cold weight and quartz arbor’s glow directly shape tactics and final image without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (proving emotion absorption) tightens via protagonist’s agency: her focus triggers the prism’s flare and jagged starburst. Escalation under Accumulative lens—density increase in frost patterns forecloses her life’s work with visceral cost ("all her research... rested on truthful lies").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete action: frost reconfiguring from cipher to mirror charges the final image ("mist... shared breath"). No moralizing; "truthful lies" crystallizes complexity without false equivalence. Resonant answer to central question via prism-as-teacher reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frost fractals as language," emotions "trapped near the base") with rhythmic control—crisis beats compress syntax ("Assumptions shattered like dropped crystal"). Zero head-hopping; mystic lexicon consistent under pressure. Patterned elision (decades of work) taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "shifted hush" evolves meaning across beats without muddle. High density: "silence... vibrated with unspoken weight" advances tension, character, and atmosphere. Final line recharges motif with cost ("companion rather than judgment")—no figurative clutter in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "epiphany trope" through specific mystic framework—prism/frost mechanism avoids abstraction. Emotional truth in control-needs-blinding bias. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off via "shared breath" synthesis, though timeframe element slightly generic.</comment>
