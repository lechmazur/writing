<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's solitary work versus need for connection, embodied through the daylily and glyphs. Final choice ("We lift together") earned by dream-witnessing with visible cost in transformed loneliness. Slight over-articulation in "grief and purpose intertwined" edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the burden remained, but it no longer crushed" crystallizes options with conceptual cost. Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds through star-decoding payoff. Orientation solid by line 30; cost legible in tears and mended loneliness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Daylily-pressed telegram functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (decoding method) and charges the final image ("pressed between her fingers like a promise"). Sensory details like "brass telescope’s cold metal" filter through astronomical urgency without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: dream witnessing leads to spectrograph verification, narrowing options to communal understanding. Cost unmistakable in "tears pricked her eyes" as solitary burden transforms. Monsoon deadline tightens stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: glyphs healing as she witnesses collective struggle, not abstraction. Final line reweights "burden" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo—the woman’s "Words carry the weight" is diegetic, not authorial sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: astronomical terms ("Cepheid variables," "light curve") filtered through emotional state. Rhythmic control under pressure in dream sequence ("moonlight slicing through cracked stone"). Consistent psychic distance; elision in dream transition taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; density multiplies meaning ("stars pulsing like distant heartbeats"). Final line avoids cliché with concrete action ("carried her forward into the new day"). Figurative language sparse and precise in peak beats; no muddle near closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "lone genius" trope through communal revelation. Specificity anchors universals: daylily-pressed telegram, variable star decoding. Emotional truth in "healing with words not spoken aloud" avoids quirky ornament. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
