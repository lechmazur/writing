<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s face-blindness creates authentic internal conflict; her ritualistic return shows embodied emotion. Final choice to draw Clara’s essence is earned, but contradictory impulses could deepen during the portrait creation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (mist, ribbon texture) escalates to Charged Poise closure. Witness arrival crystallizes options with palpable cost ("tears cutting tracks"), though coincidence slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quarry’s mist and ribbon constrain choices (measuring distance, journaling density) and charge the final image as mist thins. Micro-setting drives tactics—no decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elena’s ritual; drawing the ribbon reweights options. Agency in "lancing silence" is strong, but moral calculus between truth and empathy needs sharper friction during the portrait.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Clara’s diary ("Masks show who we fear") and ribbon’s vulnerability—no moralizing. Final image reweights "furrowed hush" into hope without stating a lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices texture/light, not faces. Rhythm modulates under stress (shorter strokes when drawing). Minor clinical slip with "prosopagnosia" label slightly disrupts lyrical flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density but scaffold in ritual description ("measured... noted...") creates subtle loop. Final image ("mist thinning to reveal pale sun") pristine; no figurative muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of face-blind artist and masquerade symbolism feels inevitable. Risk-taking (solving cold case through art, not evidence) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity avoids tropes.</comment>
