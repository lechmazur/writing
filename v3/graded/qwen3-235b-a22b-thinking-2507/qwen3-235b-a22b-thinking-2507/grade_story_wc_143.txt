<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between scientific curiosity and elegiac purpose embodied in examining meteoritic iron while the bulldozers loom; "victory tasted of ash" crystallizes earned endurance with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds through deepening "dawning hush" to Charged Poise closure; coyote's howl shattering silence as sun floods crater makes conceptual cost undeniable without causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting functions: hourglass sand grain and meteoritic iron constrain choices (borrowing grain, examining fragment) and charge final image; moonlight's textural revelation essential but summit lacks active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening silence and tightening clock (04:48→05:17) under Accumulative lens; "victory tasted of ash" and coyote's howl make conceptual cost legible, though bulldozers remain slightly distant pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Final sand grain image—"glittering like a fallen star"—reweights "message in a bottle" without moralizing; elegiac theme emerges from chemical timer and meteoritic iron rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "lunar light revealing textures invisible under harsh sun" filters science through elegy; rhythmic control peaks in hush description without syntactic monotony under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion but template cadence in final paragraphs ("He had chosen... He would outlast..."); zero figurative muddle yet repetitive stems prevent 9.0 despite high density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "last stand" trope through crater inspector's geological lens; sodium thiosulfate mechanics and "dawnlit melancholy" synthesize into fresh inflection where specificity avoids sentimentality.</comment>
