<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority strong but epiphany lacks struggle; "bright darkness" label triggers diagnostic penalty. Pilgrim's voice lacks distinction despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: cost of dismantled purpose felt when pearl's pulse shifts from "urgent" to "steady," reconfiguring stakes via Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystals constrain choices (dissonance thins air) and final image charges closure; "overlapping shadows" could deepen tactile constraint beyond visual metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake tightening when pearl's pulse becomes "urgent" forces crystallization; pilgrim-driven escalation slightly undercuts protagonist agency in pivotal revelation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dewdrop/sigh-of-stone particulars; avoids moralizing but "amplify the magic" phrase flirts with thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("vibrations humming through bones"); pilgrim's dialogue harmonizing with crystals shows distinct voice, though "profound silence" leans abstract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" repetition in closure beats creates synonym churn; otherwise high density with rhythm matching crystal dissonance. Final line rescues cohesion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</comment>Transforms "wise stranger" trope via cave pearl mechanics; "unseen forces as currents" feels fresh but "villagers for decades" risks template phrasing.</comment>
