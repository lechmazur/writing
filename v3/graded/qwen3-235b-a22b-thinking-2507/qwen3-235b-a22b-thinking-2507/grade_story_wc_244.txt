<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (cracked glasses, forced cheer), but the epiphany lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the climax—realization feels linear rather than layered under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with density increase ("polite anarchy" crystallizing into "home"), but the cost of abandoning the cure quest isn’t legibly felt in the final image; resolution leans slightly tidy despite the Charged Poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ivy-choked station functions as active micro-setting: constrains resource trades, enables "polite anarchy," and charges the final image with warmth rippling through reclaimed space—environment directly shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Aris’s agency (tracing rumors), but escalation feels passive—the community’s actions catalyze his realization more than his own choices narrow options under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: moon rock’s repricing embodies reciprocity without moralizing; final "showing up" crystallizes loneliness’s cure as action, not object, with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice permeates every line ("hazard pay for navigating my terrible jokes"); compression teaches its pattern early, and rhythm modulates perfectly under stress—jocular mask slipping reveals raw ache without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>No closure-dulling artifacts; lyrical density ("rumor, fragile as dandelion fluff") serves momentum. Minor cliché ("spiderweb" lens) but specificity ("calloused thumb on moon rock") elevates propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "loneliness cure" trope through reciprocity lens and community-focused payoff; moon rock’s irreplaceable role avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
