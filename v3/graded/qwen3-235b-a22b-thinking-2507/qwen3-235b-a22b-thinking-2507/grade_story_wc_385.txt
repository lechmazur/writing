<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear/determination) manifest in micro-choices like testing the seashell for tremors; brother’s memory fuels earned final stance with visible cost in vanished elders. "Let them" crystallizes endurance under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("last echo dies with her") under Situational lens; pressure crystallizes options via Renn’s gene revelation. Persistent constraint (Council’s power) shapes Kaela’s fragment-singing tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Seashell half functions as micro-setting: constrains choices by detecting surveillance (warming/humming) and charges closure via "steady thrum of promise." Canyon acoustics directly pressure singing strategy at Dawn Cleft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kaela’s agency under Situational lens: Renn’s "blood" revelation deepens stakes into biological truth, narrowing options to progressive disclosure. Cost unmistakable in "elders who’d vanished, echoes erased like footprints."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ending reweights "truth about echoes" through action (fragmented singing as resistance), not moralizing. Final image crystallizes theme: "each note a step toward understanding" answers central question with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vibrations in rock," "cosmic frequency") and rhythmic control under pressure; compression in high-stakes beats ("Let them") maintains texture. No head-hopping; voice modulates from lyrical to urgent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold ("richly perceptive" label) slightly dulls immediacy, but high density otherwise. No loops in peak beats; final line avoids overwriting with concrete action ("canyon would answer").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "resonance gene" transforms rebellion trope into biological/cultural bridge. Emotional specificity in sibling loss avoids generic templates; quiet resistance via song fragments heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
