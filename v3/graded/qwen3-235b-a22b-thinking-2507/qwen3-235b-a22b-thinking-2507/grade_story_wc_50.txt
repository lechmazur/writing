<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority grounded in locksmith’s tactile focus; grief/logic tension embodied in hands staying steady during capture. Flaw: minor abstraction in "store wonder in cellar of reason" slightly softens emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: captured laughter’s heartbeat glow crystallizes stakes with visible cost (tears/hands contrast). Accumulative lens holds—sensory pattern (dawn/noon/twilight) tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marble cavern’s crystalline structure actively constrains choices (prism alignment), charges final image ("fragile light" in vial). Frost creeping across vaults directly pressures tactics; sensory details reflect urgency (thrum vanishing at midday).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via protagonist’s agency: time-sensitive resonance window ("wounded season") forces micro-choices (prism tilting). Cost legible in emotional labor of capturing Silas’ laughter while grieving; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "bottle fragile beauty" reframed by laughter’s heartbeat glow in vial. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "store wonder" as active preservation against silence without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "peripherally focused" shapes syntax ("she never looked directly"). Rhythmic control deepens under pressure (short clauses during alignment). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from clinical ("quartz prisms") to lyrical ("liquid gold").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "gears like frozen leaves" avoids cliché via context. Final beat’s "soft, internal glow, no louder than a heartbeat" achieves high density. Slight register drift in "resonant memories" but offset by earned specificity elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo-harvesting as emotional preservation, not nostalgia. "Marble remembers feelings" transforms trope through locksmith’s tactile focus. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off via sensory cadence shift at twilight.</comment>
