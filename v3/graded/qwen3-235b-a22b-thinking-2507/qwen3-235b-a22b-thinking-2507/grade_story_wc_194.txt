<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation but "eloquently silent" trait lacks visible tradeoffs; internal conflict stays surface-level despite credible physicality in vibration scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (truth's burden), but standing wave mechanics appear abruptly at midpoint without prior sensory groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sepia reading room actively constrains choice (depression in floorboards, rug muffling steps) and charges final image; dust motes as micro-setting essential to climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through vibration patterns intensifying, but motivation faces no tangible friction beyond historical obfuscation; cost legible in final emotional shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through standing wave patterns reweighting "dynasty ender" concept; final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sepia," "golden shadows") modulates rhythm with vibration intensity; no head-hopping despite introspective focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but minor density issue: "dust motes danced... forming fleeting letters" slightly paraphrased by "patterns weren't random" in next sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden truth" trope via acoustic mechanics; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry through vibration-based revelation.</comment>
