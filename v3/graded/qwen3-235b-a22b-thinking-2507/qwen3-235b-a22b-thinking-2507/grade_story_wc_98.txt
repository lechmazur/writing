<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses (empiricism vs. magic) drive pivotal choices; Lyra’s thin characterization slightly undermines relationship crucible despite functional pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: monsoon deadline tightens options to Lyra’s song, with cost legible in Elara’s tears and persistent "luminous doubt" during memory flood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ridge soil, moonpetals, and tuning fork constrain choices (e.g., blossoms shivering with song resonance); final image charges setting via "blooming brighter for memories safeguarded."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Monsoon deadline escalates pressure through protagonist agency (testing pitch, guiding song); cost is unmistakable as "luminous doubt persisted" amid restored memory’s physical anchoring.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through action (measuring song’s resonance), not stated; final image reweights "truth" as "both measured and magical" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical" log, tuning fork metrics) modulates under pressure; "inherited sorrow" borders on label-speak but saved by vocal embodiment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crushed moonpetals" reappears meaningfully; "fray like rotten rope" minor metaphor clash doesn’t obscure closure’s crystalline final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empiricism validates magic via concrete mechanics (pitch measurement), avoiding trope; risk-taking heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
