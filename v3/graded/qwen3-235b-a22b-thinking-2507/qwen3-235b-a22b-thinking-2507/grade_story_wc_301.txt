<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (control/surrender) act in scene; final choice to play accordion earns closure with visible cost in "tears nourished his spirit's dry soil." No therapy-speak; embodied grief cuts like "shattered glass."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (surrendering need for control), but restroom-to-tracks transition lacks causal glue. Accumulative lens holds via density increase (graffiti → journal → song), yet escalation feels slightly abrupt pre-climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy functions as active micro-setting—brushing arms "like a benediction," parting "like a curtain"—constraining choices and charging final image. Accordion bellows' imperfection directly shapes the mending metaphor at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (self-forgiveness vs. guilt) tighten through Elias' agency: mapping → graffiti → journal shift. Cost is legible in tears as "raw solace," but pressure buildup lacks visceral urgency before the restroom epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river/mapping motifs without moralizing; final image ("forgiveness was a current, not a destination") reweights the central question. Avoids Thematic Echo by embedding wisdom in diegetic graffiti.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers tracing contour lines with clinical precision") and rhythmic control under pressure. Slight tic in repeated "daringly methodical" but saved by purposeful compression in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "raw solace" repetition and borderline mixed metaphor ("tears nourished dry soil"). No closure-dulling artifacts, but "methodical" overuse triggers -0.3 per Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: river chronicler lens transforms grief tropes via mapping/accordion metaphors. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry; "patched bellows" specificity avoids abstraction.</comment>
