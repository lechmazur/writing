<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "intimately aloof" nature versus release; embodied grief ("tears blurred her vision") avoids therapy-speak. Minor slip: "grief softened into something bearable" edges toward abstraction without full sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density shift in cave scene; closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("chest lighter than since mirror cracked"). Orientation clear by line 3; no causality breaks in pivotal shell placement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Phosphorescent moss and shell constrain choices (kneeling at water's edge) and charge final image ("painted stars glowing softly"). Micro-setting functions as environment: cave's warmth/damp directly enables the release epiphany.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stake (release from grief) tightens through protagonist's agency in shell placement; cost legible in "lighter chest" and altered perspective. Single deepening beat suffices at this length, but mirror crack urgency lacks active clock pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell's transformation from burden to tribute; "temporary eternity" reweighted without moralizing. Final image ("sea finally felt like a beginning") resonates as non-literal answer to grief's stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cerulean paint" and "fractured sunlight"; rhythmic control heightens pressure in cave discovery. Minor register drift in "intimately aloof" but compensated by concrete sensory phrasing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with "velvet for fifteen years, its colors still vibrant" compressing time. Final line recharges motif without muddle. One paraphrase loop ("anchored in memory... demanded presence") barely avoids penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through specific shell constellations and mirror crack symbolism; "temporary eternity" synthesis feels inevitable. Risk in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though timeframe lacks urgency.</comment>
