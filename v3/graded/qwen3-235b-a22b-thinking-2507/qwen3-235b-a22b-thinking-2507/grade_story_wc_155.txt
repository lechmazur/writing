<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but "pensive mirth" violates anti-pattern for therapy-speak in peak beats; otherwise strong embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure like loading flawed film.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (years of lost joy now reclaimed); fog thinning crystallizes options without coincidence; Accumulative lens holds through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice (canvas for projection) and charges final image; "moss-choked earth" and crumbling wall shape tactile discovery of fresco fragment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency when she reinterprets exposed film as "memory made visible"; cost legible in "tears cutting clean paths" but secondary accent (orchard decay) slightly dilutes dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("fog seemed thinner") reweights "joy isn't a destination" without moralizing; thematic resonance emerges from fresco fragment's physicality rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("boots sinking into moss-choked earth") modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "pensive mirth" slightly disrupts voice coherence in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops but "pensive mirth" triggers patterned-artifact penalty; high density otherwise with strategic telling compressing backstory via fresco fragment cue.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "artist's revival" trope through fog-projection mechanic; emotional specificity in "tears cutting clean paths through grime" avoids generic templates.</comment>
