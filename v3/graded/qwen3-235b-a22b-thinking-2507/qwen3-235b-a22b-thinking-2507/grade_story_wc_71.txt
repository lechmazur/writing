<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Micro-choices under pressure (placing objects with escalating hope) reveal contradictory impulses—scientific curiosity vs spiritual yearning—yet secondary character absence limits relationship crucible depth despite strong embodied emotion in the Finnegan climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (the house's "fragile, returning warmth" reconfiguring abandonment into endurance), but Mrs. Finnegan's off-page fading slightly obscures the emotional price despite the porch's palpable pulse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bay actively supplies ritual objects (sea stone, laurel) that constrain choices, with the orris root's tactile presence charging the final image—its "silent now, its work done" crystallizing the theme through micro-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as each house test narrows options (inert yellow cottage → alive bungalow → dying Finnegan), but the absence of secondary character pressure slightly dilutes the dominant stake's interpersonal weight during the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (marble, teacup handle) culminating in the non-literal answer "they were held," avoiding moralizing though the line "The living ones weren’t haunted" risks thematic echo without sufficient narrative friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("houses sometimes sighed," "streetlights daydreamed") with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats, though the phrase "inadvertently profound" momentarily drifts into authorial reflection rather than character-bound thought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional density falters in the climax where "tears pricked Elara’s eyes" followed by the insight about "displaced objects of human care" edges into diagnostic label-speak, dulling the closure image's immediacy by 0.5 points.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of domestic magic through mundane objects (marble, teacup handle) transforms tropes, but avoids radical risk—Elara's "creeping normality noticer" trait feels slightly archetypal rather than uniquely embodied in pivotal choices.</comment>
