<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Blindness as active constraint, not deficit; contradictory impulses (exhaustion vs focus) drive micro-choices like the "breath held" adjustment. Daughter motivation earns closure through embodied cost of the repair effort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost: harbor bells' final toll coincides with repair completion, crystallizing stakes. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup to the drone's hum harmonizing—a decisive reconfiguration without physical action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Water basin constrains every repair choice; its refraction mechanics directly charge the final image as the drone "translates refracted light into clear vectors." Mist isn't backdrop but functional pressure for the ship's navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor bells' countdown tightens pressure organically; Elara's agency drives escalation through water-refraction method. Cost legible in her "absolute stillness" during vibration—tactical endurance that reconfigures the dominant stake (repair vs ship departure).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>"Blindness as lens" theme emerges through refraction physics, not statement. Final drone flight reweights the premise: atmospheric distortion becomes safe passage, offering non-literal answer to "how uncertainty guides" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: "discordant whisper against inner quiet" embodies sensory priority. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during repair, clipped phrasing at climax ("A breath held"). Zero POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "microscopic tear" to "micro-adjustment" shows purposeful repetition. Final line "sailed into the grey dawn" charges closure with specificity. Minor deduction for "discordant whisper" slightly abstracting sensation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesis of blindness + refraction physics transforms repair trope. Risk-taking in sensory focus pays off: drone's purpose (navigating fog) emerges organically from method, avoiding symbolic convenience. Freshness in "iridescent polymer film" detail.</comment>
