<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (clinging to echoes as survival vs. hollow prophecies) drives micro-choices like frantic chalk-drawing; "phantom vibration of a heartbeat not his own" embodies embodied emotion without cliché. Minor deduction for "clinging to echoes wasn’t metaphor here; it was survival" tipping into explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: fog swallowing the sound while Silas stands "empty-handed" crystallizes the irreversible cost of forgetting, with "hollow tide within him" making the conceptual cost undeniable under Accumulative/Textural lens. No flaws in causal integrity for this design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fog functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices (erasing driftwood markers, warping sound), charging the final image where it "swallows the sculptures." The bleached log’s "plink" reweights the environment’s role in the closure with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation via density increase: fog thickening, premonition fracturing, and markers becoming "alien" tighten the dominant stake (capturing time’s sound) until the plink’s meaning drains. Cost legible in "meaning drained from it like tide from sand" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "plink" as resonant answer to "sound of growing older," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("hunting a sound he’d never remember losing") reweights tidal longing without abstraction, though "proof he hadn’t imagined the weight of his own life" edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("preconitively forgetful," "bleeding tomorrow dry") modulates rhythm under pressure; fog-warped gull cry shows syntactic control. Non-standard semicolons and fragmented cadence taught early pay off in closure’s legibility under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chalk grinding against stone" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor density dip in "he remembered forgetting this very moment tomorrow, the cruel loop of his gift" slightly slows momentum in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time perception via sonic decay (water drop on mirror shard), avoiding cliché. "Tidal longing" motif transforms from ache to hollow tide with emotional specificity, though "junkyard prophet" risks slight trope without deeper world logic.</comment>
