<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phil's contradictory impulses (rationality vs emotional investment in preservation) act simultaneously as he defends the cog. His abrasive calm under Kael's intrusion reveals embodied motivation through micro-choices like tracing sediment layers. No diagnostic labels; flaws (obsessiveness) compound pressure without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: Kael's retreat crystallizes options with conceptual cost (drownings from ignorance) visible in the sediment map. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sediment density escalation; the trench wall's layers reweight stakes via Phil's evidence presentation. Cost legible in "rational crack" and raw fingers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The chronometer cog constrains choices (navigation method) and charges the final image as "beacon of reason." Flooded tunnels pressure every action—from spoon excavation to surface dwellers' dangerous travel—while sensory details (lantern beam, oily smoke) reflect Phil's precise priorities. Micro-setting replaces broad worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving tidal knowledge vs. surface myths) tightens when Kael kicks silt into the trench, forcing Phil to present layered evidence. Escalation under Accumulative lens: sediment density reweights survival stakes as Phil exposes the "divine punishment" narrative's lethal cost. Agency in stance crystallization forecloses surface dwellers' simplicity with felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sediment layers and the cog's function—no moralizing. Final image (cog as beacon) reweights "rational rebellion" as non-literal answer to narrative conflict. Complexity honored: surface dwellers' fear isn't redeemed, but Kael's doubt shows earned nuance. Epiphany arises from Phil's excavation labor, not abstract thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Phil's clinical focus on sediment composition and gear mechanics ("brass teeth glinting dully") reflects his worldview. Voice modulates under pressure—terse dialogue with Kael versus internal precision. Zero head-hopping; free indirect style ("They called his work madness; he called it preservation") crystallizes thematic tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally ("one cog, one layer, one agonizing spoonful" finale). Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes (e.g., "fingers raw" conveys cost without stating it). Figurative language sparse but potent ("beacon of reason"). Final line recharges the cog motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms post-apocalyptic tropes through tidal mechanics and sediment as narrative evidence. Emotional truth in quiet endurance (not survivalist heroics) feels fresh. The sunken city's specificity—chronometer calculating lunar tides—creates irreplaceable stakes. Risk-taking (knowledge as rebellion) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
