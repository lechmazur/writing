<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kaito’s embodied micro-choices (shielding lavender, offering stone) revealing hierarchy of values; flaws like over-idealization avoided through tangible cost of his offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with visible cost (river stone offering) under Accumulative lens; the final thrum reweights prior stillness into active resistance without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brittle sage over the well and stunted lavender directly constrain choices—Kaito’s shielding action charges the final image; sensory detail reflects urgency through tactile clay and phototropic glass.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure: "flattened chimney smoke" tightening evolves to "curling" smoke signaling altered tactics; cost of the stone offering forecloses passive witnessing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (shielding bloom, pressing stone)—final thrum reweights "darkness having final word" into persistent light without moralizing; no abstract statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct in potter’s tactile focus ("weight of potter’s wheel," "smooth river stone"); rhythmic control under pressure avoids filter-verb stacks despite lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density slip in "thrum intensified, shivering into a chorus" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise clean propulsion with concrete verbs ("cupped," "pressed," "dipped") avoiding scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "phototropic kindness" transforms time-resistance trope; emotional specificity in keeper’s final lantern-lighting avoids generic hope, committing fully to the premise.</comment>
