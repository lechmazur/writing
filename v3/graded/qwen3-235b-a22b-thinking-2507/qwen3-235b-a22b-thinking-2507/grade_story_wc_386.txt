<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in micro-choices (weaving dream cameos while tears freeze), avoiding therapy-speak. Final renunciation of "relic" for "pure thought" earns visible cost through embodied grief, though profession borders slightly on convenient archetype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes perfectly: "the melted snow globe no longer looked broken—it looked like a promise" reweights truth’s cost with undeniable conceptual pressure. Accumulative lens holds flawlessly from orientation ("candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" by word 15) through escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacier ice shrine constrains choices (subzero stillness anchoring unwavering candles) and charges closure via "borrowed starlight" refracting through the snow globe. Micro-setting as essential pressure point, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. crew’s shame) tightens through dream cameos’ escalating revelations, with Elara’s agency driving each deepening. Cost crystallizes in frozen tears during Finn’s piano-wire lighthouse vision, though Oslo student cameo edges toward convenient escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bleeding snow globe reweights "pure thought" without moralizing. Final image answers central question—truth as salvaged promise—avoiding false balance while honoring crew’s flawed humanity through Varga’s daughter-focused end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("subzero stillness," "deep-throated song of ice") modulates rhythm under pressure. Only slight drift in "fracture in the crew’s soul" risks abstraction, but immediate concrete examples ("piano wire" lighthouse) restore texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops; "cloudy amber tear" does triple duty (image/metaphor/plot). Final line’s crystalline reprise ("no longer looked broken—it looked like a promise") avoids muddle. "Crushing dark" narrowly avoids overwriting via physicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ghost-whisperer trope transformed through specific mechanics (dream cameos) and emotional truth (captain’s focus on laughter). Fresh angle: truth as salvaged memory rather than physical object, avoiding sentimentality via concrete stakes.</comment>
