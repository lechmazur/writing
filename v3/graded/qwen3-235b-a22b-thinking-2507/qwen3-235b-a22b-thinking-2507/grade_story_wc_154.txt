<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("shrewdly innocent" trait) manifests in decoding child's cipher when medics dismiss it; embodied emotion avoids labels via coral's "porous labyrinth holding ocean memories" and "pulse beneath [wound]"; final renunciation of survivor guilt earned through Lantau reef parallel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "meaning could still take root" crystallizes options with felt cost ("war scarred... but in this mist"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shift when coral decodes cast; cost legible in "pulse beneath [wound], steady and alive" reconfiguring trauma.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brain coral (micro-setting) constrains choice when matched to cast's topography; "mist thickened" pressure visible as Aris reshapes symbol; final image ("cast gleaming") charged by coral's healing reprise; sensory hierarchy shows translator's tactile decoding focus under anesthetic haze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: "Alone" revelation tightens dominant stake (translating pain) into active hope; "shared anxieties" pressure crystallizes stance when Aris reshapes tear-smudge; cost legible in "father's boat sank" dots becoming "currents carry him home" despite no guarantee.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from coral regrowing over bomb scars transforming destruction into habitat; final image ("broken things could be read, and remade") reweights premise without moralizing; avoids Thematic Echo via concrete action (reshaping symbol) rather than abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature: translator's linguistic precision shapes noticing ("coastal pidgin," "cipher beneath"); rhythmic control under pressure with anesthetic's "cottony embrace" compressing syntax; voice modulates from "jagged edges" to "quiet certainty" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "ghostly hieroglyphs" and "knotted surface" achieve high density without muddle; strategic telling ("spent months translating...") compresses backstory; final line's "pulse beneath it" delivers propulsion with closure charge; no figurative overwriting in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: coral as decryption tool transforms war trauma trope; "encrypted cast" fresh inflection grows from translator's skills; risks lyrical compression ("watercolors of indigo") that heightens coherence; avoids safety middle via unflinching "lotus-hearted ache" specificity.</comment>
