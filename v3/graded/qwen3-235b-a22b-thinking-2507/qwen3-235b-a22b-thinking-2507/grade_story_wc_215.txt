<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "weight of unspoken words" as both burden and duty, but "tranquilly perceptive" label lacks embodied struggle under peak pressure. Micro-choice to approach the shed earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—"unspoken words were safe" crystallizes Silas’s silent endurance as covenant fulfillment. Accumulative lens holds through density shift when ghost dissolves, reweighting stakes with the dew honeycomb.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The apiary shed’s structural integrity (ghosts avoid it) directly constrains ghost behavior and Silas’s choices. Ash-covered stool and dew honeycomb charge the final image, though lavender fields verge on decorative postcard detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through ghost child’s appearance forcing stance crystallization—"listen, not speak" forecloses vocal resolution with felt cost (lifelong silence as duty). Agency via attention shift reweights preservation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bees as memory" and ghosts as guides; final image reweights covenant as "waiting" without moralizing. Dew honeycomb cell delivers non-literal answer to "how to preserve voice" through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in fracture-reading ("chip shaped like bee’s wing") modulates under pressure. Minor register drift in "tranquilly perceptive" but rhythmic control excels during ghost encounter’s silent choreography.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Template cadence in reflective blocks ("He lived... He never opened...") slightly dulls mid-beat momentum. No closure artifacts, but filter-verb cluster ("he felt," "he understood") in high-pressure ghost scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and covenant tropes through beekeeping specificity. "Ghosts as messengers" avoids cliché; emotional truth in muteness-as-preservation elevates beyond surface novelty with risk-taking quiet closure.</comment>
