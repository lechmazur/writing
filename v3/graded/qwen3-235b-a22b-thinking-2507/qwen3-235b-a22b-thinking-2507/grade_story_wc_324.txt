<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (childhood trauma driving belief in spirits) is concrete and fuels her procedural defiance, but contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. professional boundaries—lack sufficient friction during the climax sprint; interiority leans slightly tell-heavy in peak stress ("voice raw with urgency").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the cracking wall and "testament" photo crystallize cost (averted disaster) under a causal lens, with early anchors (twilight → gala timing) ensuring orientation. One tightening—pulse spike to evacuation—sufficiently narrows options without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hearing aid (tool-as-setting) constrains choices: its dust-clogged mechanics dictate how Agnes' warning is decoded, and the final image (photo in Lily's hands) charges closure by transforming it from mystery to proof. Mist actively obscures the wall flaw, creating tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally—photo discovery forces Elara's choice to override procedure—but escalation feels slightly rushed; the pulse spike to evacuation leap lacks a visible micro-cost (e.g., hesitation) that would deepen the trade-off between duty and urgency in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "love once traced never fades" is earned through the photo's reprise as active proof, not moralizing. Final image reweights "incidental heroism" by showing salvation via vulnerable voices, avoiding sentimentality with concrete cost (cracking plaster).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragile echoes of love," hearing-focused details) modulates beautifully under pressure, but "voice raw with urgency" slightly flattens Elara's lexicon during the evacuation sprint, diluting her otherwise controlled rhythmic tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulse flickered, weak as a moth’s wing" exemplifies high-density imagery. Slight register drift in "residual pulses of unresolved emotion" (clinical phrasing) jars mid-crisis, but closure beat ("mend the world’s fractures") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "contact tracer for hearts" with structural danger avoids trope clichés, but the hearing aid’s mechanics feel slightly convenient (dust-clogged yet miraculously functional). Risk-taking elevates stakes through mundane tech, though not quite inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
