<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "technically gentle" hands embody professional precision clashing with raw emotional need. Forgiveness backstory anchors present micro-choices without summary; tears freezing during rope tension shows embodied cost. No diagnostic labels despite peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: pulling the rope taut yields light "not a glare but soft illumination," etching names in frost while tears freeze. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via braid reconfiguration until aurora flare crystallizes stakes. Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum actively constrains choices: frigid air threatens the brittle card, aurora light enables the rope's transformation. Final image of names "etched in living frost" charges closure through setting physics, not symbolism. Micro-setting of braids directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: each braid reconfiguration narrows options (one tremor loses names forever). Cost is visceral in "tears freezing on her cheeks" as she pulls the rope, foreclosing silence with bronze. Single deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: preserving names as "resistance against oblivion" crystallizes when bronze captures light-patterns. Final image of "new constellation under the ice" reweights premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; Liora/Anya/Kael are specific, not platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is caster-specific: "aurora light bleeding like liquid emerald" reflects material-transformation lens. Under stress, syntax compresses ("She placed... aligned... mirrored") without losing voice. Zero head-hopping; all sensory details filtered through her profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "snowmelt ardor" avoids cliché by modulating with pressure. Only minor deduction: "technically gentle" repeats (lines 15/32) but contextual variation saves it. Final line "green and gentle" risks sentimentality yet earns resonance via prior frost imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms memory-preservation trope through wax-casting physics: sonic blueprints in perforations, bronze capturing light. Emotional truth in "forgiveness was the quiet ground" avoids cliché. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
