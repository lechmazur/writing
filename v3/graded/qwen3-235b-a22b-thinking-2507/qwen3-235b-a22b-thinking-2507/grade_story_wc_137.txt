<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (skepticism vs inherited duty) drives micro-choices like pocketing then using the tile; embodied fear ("knuckles white") and calf memory layer authentically. Change feels earned but the overnight shift from "scoffing" to risking reputation lacks sufficient friction in the final confrontation beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: whales correcting course crystallizes the cost of dredging and Elara's risk. Causal lens holds ("because" of transcriptions, ships reroute) with no orientation debt. Vision transition ("tower dissolved") slightly disrupts causality but cost (fractured sky-road) remains legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tower and tile function as micro-setting that constrains choices (tile placement enables vision) and charges the final image (tile "warm with purpose"). Whale migration timeframe pressures decisions; salt spray and obsidian etching reflect urgency. Final breach scene makes environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when star-shifts explain migration path, forcing Elara's choice to risk reputation. Agency drives escalation (transcribing, confronting villagers) with visible cost (social standing). Minor issue: dredging's causal role in star-shifts feels slightly under-dramatized before the vision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interconnectedness emerges through entangled memories without moralizing; final image ("symphony wasn’t unheard—it had always been there") reweights the premise with conceptual cost. No thematic echo; complexity embraced as whales' fear shifts to hope through human action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("transcribed patterns," "geometric constellations shifting like living ink") reflects scientific observer POV. Rhythm modulates under pressure ("She gasped, dropping her pen"). No head-hopping; stress compresses syntax appropriately during vision sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold; "stranded and unfamiliar" followed by "strange rhythms" creates minor paraphrase loop. Final line ("ceased to be a skeptic. She was a witness") avoids sentimentality. No figurative muddle in peak beats despite lyrical tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of environmental crisis with cosmic resonance through specific details (9x9 obsidian tile, gray whale migration). Transforms "skeptic to believer" trope via whale-song patterns as actionable data. Risk-taking (vision sequence) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
