<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" but interiority lacks embodied contradiction; "profound transformation" told not shown through micro-choices like neural lace adjustments under stress. Epiphany feels unearned without prior struggle with flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure as "keeper of lost light" crystallizes stance with felt cost ("body vibrated with collective sorrow"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens; single deepening ("Aris understood then") insufficient for high-band escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Broken mirror shards function as micro-setting charging final image ("conduits of memory"), but canyon remains ornamental post-anchor; "silvered walls" don't constrain choices despite vivid texture. Misses 9+ gate by lacking environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrecting dreams) signaled early, but pressure fails to deepen meaningfully; "quaking reverie" deepening alters knowledge without narrowing options or altering tactics, violating band guardrail for 8.8+ escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through mirror shards; final image ("silence did not feel empty... beginning of excavation") delivers resonant Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. "Beauty that still lingered" avoids sentimentality through concrete fragments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "synaptic storm") but "quaking reverie" repetition creates template cadence; stress-induced compression missing during memory flood where syntax should fracture, failing 9+ rhythmic control test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in final third: "quaking reverie" repeated identically 4x; filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Text Artifact Screen triggers -0.7 deduction disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of neural tech + dream archeology avoids trope pitfalls, but "broken mirror = fragmented psyche" lacks transformation; emotional specificity in "taste of salt from tears" elevates without gimmickry.</comment>
