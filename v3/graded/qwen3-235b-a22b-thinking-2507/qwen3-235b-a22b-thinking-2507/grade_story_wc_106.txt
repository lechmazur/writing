<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "heart hammered... not from fear of capture, but from desperate need," with micro-choices like thermal-expansion trick revealing embodied expertise; only minor flaw is limited internal conflict beyond grief/hope duality during high-stakes decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: kneeling to hear "station’s true heartbeat" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (self-discovery over finding mother), while Accumulative lens holds through density shifts from floral decoding to resonant hum; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emerald station’s thermal-expansion detail constrains the theft tactic, and moonbeam jar’s pulse charging the final image ("sealing illuminated moment into her bones") satisfies 9+ gate; sensory hierarchy masterfully narrows from golden-hour radiance to damp-stone tunnel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding maternal legacy) tightens through moonbeam revelation to Track 13, with visible cost in "luminous disbelief" tears; pressure grows via Accumulative density shift, though antagonistic pressure remains atmospheric rather than actively opposing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through "fragile intersections of light and choice," culminating in final image where moonbeams "flared brightly, as if applauding"—reweighting "illuminated moments" as self-creation without moralizing; avoids thematic echo despite poetic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: "mineral tang of emerald-tinted air" filters setting through thief’s expertise; rhythmic control under pressure ("three blue delphiniums...") avoids elision issues; voice modulates from tense precision to awe without tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with "liquid gold" opening anchoring voice, though "fragile vessel containing captured moonbeams" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat; zero loops or scaffold, but density risks minor muddle without payoff in that exact line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "thief seeking lost parent" trope via floral-coding specificity and "illuminated moments" as active philosophy; moonbeam jar’s reprise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking (lyric pacing) heightening stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
