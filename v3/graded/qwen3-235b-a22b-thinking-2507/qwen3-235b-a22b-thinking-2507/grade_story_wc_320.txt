<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear ("find beginning in every ending") and closure earned through tangible shift from filtering to tuning silence, but epiphany lacks embodied contradiction; "physics" declaration risks diagnostic label-speak without sufficient struggle prior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: bone-deep tone crystallizes cosmic cyclicity. Accumulative lens holds via density increase (anomaly → shard → resonance), though escalation relies on single deepening beat rather than layered pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gorge mist transforms from atmospheric detail to essential medium ("carrying the hush"), constraining Elara's final realization. Shard's physicality (cool/heavy glass) charges closure image when placed in satchel, though Hollywood ruins lack active pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency—wrenching dials past safety stops—and cost manifests as physical vibration in bones. Lunar perigee creates live clock, but escalation lacks meaningful complication beyond the shard's introduction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through cosmic lullaby imagery, avoiding moralizing; "endings as tuning forks" reweights premise via bone-deep tone. Near-miss with "not metaphor, but physics" risking thematic echo, but earned through sensory struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tuned not instruments, but the silence") modulates under pressure, with rhythmic control in climax ("wrenched the main dial... ignoring safety protocols"). No POV drift, though stress compression slightly over-smooths thought degradation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold loops ("serenely electric" repetitions) and borderline purple prose ("perpetual mist that muffled even the wind's sigh") dull climax impact. Final-third "serenely electric glow" triggers artifact cap, preventing higher score despite strong momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and myth (Hollywood shard as cosmic key) avoids cliché through specific stakes. Risk-taking elevates tension—lunar perigee as spacetime amplifier—but "beginning in every ending" premise leans familiar without deeper moral calculus.</comment>
