<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in chess metaphor ("winnow," "forbidden game") avoids therapy-speak; embodied guilt via fidgeting-to-purposeful hands shows contradictory impulses. Slight deduction for epiphany about spies feeling unearned by prior causality despite strong micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (apology to younger self), but spy conspiracy resolution lacks causal buildup—labyrinth's revelation feels coincidental rather than earned by her actions, weakening the Accumulative/Textural lens coherence at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth functions as micro-setting that charges closure (now "a compass recalibrating her soul"); tapestry threads constrain choices during winnowing. Rain-shower payoff reweights time-frozen environment with visceral cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through thread-decoding pressure, but spy sabotage revelation resolves via external device (labyrinth's reflection) rather than protagonist's agency, violating Accumulative/Textural escalation rules—cost is felt but not fully earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through tapestry's unraveling: "integrating lessons" shown via azure/ochre threads, not stated. Final rain image reweights "time-frozen" with conceptual cost (stasis vs. renewal) without moralizing—perfect non-literal answer to self-forgiveness question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("chess tutor’s eye," "frayed strands corresponded to a move") modulates under stress; "woven hush" refrain evolves meaning. Minor register drift in "fierce repose" excused by character lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "plucking individual threads to separate vital sequence" compresses action. Slight deduction for dense opening ("thunder’s lull punctuating the woven hush") bordering on overwriting, but no closure-dulling artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms time-freeze trope through chess/tapestry synthesis; "winnowing" as decoding threads feels inevitable. Spy twist slightly derivative, but specificity of crimson/silver/black threads and self-forgiveness arc elevates beyond template.</comment>
