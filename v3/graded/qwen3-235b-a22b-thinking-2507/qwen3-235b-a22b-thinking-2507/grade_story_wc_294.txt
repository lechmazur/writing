<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (flee vs. honor circles) drives the climax; embodied panic ("whispered *run*") and micro-choices (drawing symbols) reveal values with visible cost in the spiral gesture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral’s "gleaming faintly" crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("paths circle back as correction"), under Accumulative/Textural lens where density shift reweights stakes through symbols.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The circus train’s corroded undercarriage functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (drawing markers to dissuade scavengers) and charges the final image ("compass pointing true"), avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elias’ agency (drawing symbols to redefine territory), but scavengers remain off-page, diluting pressure; cost ("hollow promises of disruption") feels earned yet slightly abstract for high-band escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally via the spiral’s reprise: "paths circle back as correction" reweights prior failure without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo while embracing complexity ("ambition unchecked by reverence").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("rust like cold sweat," "dusky harmony") modulates with stress; rhythmic control in climax ("methodically, his polished calm a shield") avoids head-hopping despite single POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats; high density ("a dissuade, a silent plea") with concrete verbs, though "dusky harmony" risks slight overwriting early without payoff in that phrase alone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tech/startup tropes with territorial symbolism feels inevitable; risk-taking (drawing as dissuasion) heightens stakes without gimmickry, transforming familiar legacy themes through specific, verifiable detail.</comment>
