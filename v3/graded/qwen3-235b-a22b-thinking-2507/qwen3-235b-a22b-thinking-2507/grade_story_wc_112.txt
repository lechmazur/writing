<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (obliging duty vs secret passion) drive the lever pull; embodied emotion in "tears freezing on cheeks" avoids diagnostic labels. Slight tell in "years of ridicule" summary lacks specific micro-choice anchor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: frozen tears and "icy warmth of solitude" crystallize the victory's emotional weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The holographic lever constrains her action (feather-light resistance) and charges the final image ("ghostly solidity"). "Mechanically warm" floor heat directly opposes lethal chill, shaping her tactile decisions under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her agency: the lever's calibrated resistance forces precise action during the narrow "sacred quiet" window. Cost is visceral in "tears freezing" and the implied years of struggle paid for this solitary vindication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lateral temporal data ("clocks stuttering backward"), not statement. Final image reweights "hush of beating wings at rest" into proof of sideways time, avoiding moralizing while charging the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in mechanical details ("conduits," "servos") and sensory contrasts ("ozone," "icy pane"). Rhythm compresses under pressure ("Her hands trembled, not from cold...") without voice slippage or filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("wiped frost," "pulsed stronger"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("wings folded like dormant sails"), never muddying the lever-pull climax. Final line recharges "icy warmth" with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Time moves sideways" transforms time-travel tropes via magnetic nexus mechanics and lateral displacement data. Risk-taking (quiet climax over explosion) heightens stakes coherently, with leviathans' stillness making the discovery feel earned and specific.</comment>
