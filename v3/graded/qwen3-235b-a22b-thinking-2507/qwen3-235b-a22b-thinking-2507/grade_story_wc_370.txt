<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: trembling hands crumpling then smoothing the invitation reveals her hierarchy of values (safety vs. connection) with visceral cost. No therapy-speak; grief as "physical ache" grounds her empathy flaw without over-articulation. Final choice earned via the book’s inscription reweighting her core fear, though the "wisdom in mistake" insight slightly edges toward thematic echo without deeper struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: her movement toward the shimmer crystallizes the stance shift with undeniable cost ("leaving behind the illusion of safety"). Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies via clock chimes and sensory accumulation (beeswax, groaning paper), narrowing options until midnight’s chime. Cost is unmistakable: "fragile equilibrium" shattered as she embraces connection’s risk, though the book’s appearance relies slightly on Circle intervention rather than pure agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Municipal Archives basement micro-setting directly charges closure: "hidden in plain sight" setting evolves from hiding place to "home" as she redefines solitude. Crumpled paper’s texture mirrors her emotional state, and beeswax-scented silence constrains her choice—removing this environment would collapse the thematic resonance. Final image ("library welcomed her home") reweights prior solitude through tangible spatial transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: the clock’s chimes narrow options while the book’s appearance deepens knowledge (wisdom in imperfection), forcing her to confront isolation’s "slow suffocation." Agency shines in her micro-choice to align the invitation with the book’s page. Cost is legible—"fragile equilibrium" broken—but escalation leans slightly on the Circle’s external intervention rather than solely protagonist-driven pressure under peak stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the crumpled invitation’s physicality embodies "wisdom in the tear," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("welcomed her home") resonates as a non-literal answer to isolation’s cost, reweighting the library’s paradoxes without stating morals. The inscription risks thematic echo but stays earned through her embodied panic and smoothing gesture, transforming abstract fear into tactile possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels: she notices paper’s "groan" and "whispered sorrows," filtering world through empathetic lens. Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—staccato sentences at 11:55 panic ("Panic, cold and sudden, flared") versus lyrical calm in resolution. Zero head-hopping; voice remains distinctively hers even during high-stress moments without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts: every line advances atmosphere or character ("ink bled where raindrops... fallen" compresses backstory and tension). Figurative language sparse but potent ("silence seemed to breathe"); closure beat ("she didn’t move towards the door...") avoids overwriting while charging the final image. No loops or scaffold—propulsion through concrete verbs ("smoothed," "traced," "shimmered") maintains clarity under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "isolated keeper" trope via empathy as burden/gift, grounded in Municipal Archives specificity. Emotional truth elevates familiar stakes—her "slow suffocation" rings authentic. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens coherence, though the "enlarged tranquility" concept slightly leans on abstraction. Transformation test passed: plot fails if transplanted elsewhere, as library’s paradoxes define her arc.</comment>
