<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction underdeveloped; "mildly obsessed" trait lacks visible tradeoffs despite strong embodied emotion ("fingers stained with ink and salt"). Final choice earned but micro-choices don't reveal layered values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (darkness floods fort yet map complete); Accumulative lens holds through density escalation ("ambered hush deepening" to "world’s first breath"). Single tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flaking gold leaf booklet constrains choice (fragile medium shapes map) and charges final image ("warm in her hand"); storm pressure alters tactics (marking silences mid-roar). Micro-setting mastery with sensory hierarchy reflecting urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming the dark) tightens through protagonist’s active silence-mapping; cost (absolute darkness) legible at closure. Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens but secondary pressure (fort’s shuddering) lacks causal integration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("drawing absence of stars"); final image reweights "silence" as ground beneath feet without moralizing. Avoids abstraction via "pebbles holding sea’s memory" and map’s tangible topography.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence pooled between waves") with rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from "wind screamed" to "suspended moment." No head-hopping; free indirect style clean in high-stakes beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "wax pooling like frozen tears" shows without telling. Minor density risk in "marbled hush, cool and veined with stillness" but payoff in closure image justifies lyricism. Propulsion flawless through cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope via silence cartography; "ambered hush" reconfiguration feels inevitable. Bold risk in textural escalation pays off with emotional specificity ("darkness not void but landscape"). Avoids safety-middle through oracle’s tactile pragmatism.</comment>
