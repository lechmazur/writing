<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak through embodied details (breath fogging eyepiece, pen warmth) and contradictory impulses (corporate caution vs journalistic courage). Micro-choice of capping the pen crystallizes value hierarchy with visible cost. Slight motivation speed in logic-to-action shift prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: satellite tracing "man-made truth" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with undeniable conceptual cost (legacy vs truth). Orientation flawless by word 40; causal lens holds through proof construction. Ben's call complicates but doesn't resolve, satisfying Hybrid lens at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory chronometer constrains choice as functional proof mechanism, not backdrop. Final satellite image charges closure by embodying "man-made truth." Pen functions as micro-setting—its tactile warmth during logic battle directly shapes the decisive call to Ben.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Clara's agency: her proof-by-contradiction deepens knowledge under causal lens, narrowing options to one decisive action. Cost is visceral ("noose" of regret tightening then released) and conceptual (legacy hangs on atomic precision). Senator's alibi slightly abstract but pen's physicality grounds stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through celestial mechanics ("orbits of regret") reweighted by final satellite image—no moralizing. "Man-made truth hurtling above clouds" answers central question non-literally, embracing complexity (truth freed but legacy still haunted). Avoids Thematic Echo despite high-stakes premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("stars pulse in orbits of regret") filters all description through journalist's observational bias. Rhythmic control shines in logic sequence ("Assume the timestamp is forged..."). Minor register drift in "solemn playfulness flickered" slightly abstracts peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "trembling, the accusation circling like a satellite" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline-explanatory phrase ("Devotedly observant by nature—trained...") avoids scaffold but lacks peak-beat immediacy. Figurative language consistently serves pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms media-scandal trope through celestial mechanics lens—truth verified by atomic clocks, regret orbiting like satellites. Emotional specificity (pen warmth vs "ash in mouth") avoids generic templates. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure image feels inevitable.</comment>
