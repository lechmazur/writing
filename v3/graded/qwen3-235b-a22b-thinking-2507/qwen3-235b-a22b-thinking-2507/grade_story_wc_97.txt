<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority relies on telling ("steely longing") over embodied contradiction; emotional progression lacks layered irrationality during peak pressure despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with visceral cost (last light swallowed, final note) under causal lens; orientation anchors instantly with "above the clouds" while clock's tick crystallizes irreversible change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tidal arbor's magnetism actively constrains choices (masking presence), while broken clock and reel charge the final image through sonic vibration and coalescing figure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Horizon's darkening creates relentless causal pressure narrowing options; cost legible in Elara's race against light with visible trade-offs in musical intervention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting: "time holding its breath" transforms into the clock's tick, avoiding moralizing while resonating with the unplanned encore's cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct musical POV signature ("resonant chord," "fragile images") modulates rhythm under pressure; minor filter-verb intrusion ("remembering melodies") barely dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in climax; propulsion via tactile verbs ("fingers flew," "shuddered") but slight paraphrase loop in reel description mid-beat prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of music/time mechanics feels inevitable—vibrating piano as temporal key transforms clichés through specific, lived stakes in tidal arbor's logic.</comment>
