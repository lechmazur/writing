<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (fear/compliance vs legacy-driven resolve) manifest physically in "phantom chill" and final decision; "vulnerability fortified" slightly abstracts embodiment but scalpel discovery earns closure through tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes when dripping water "sounded like resolve," reconfiguring options with visible cost ("consequences be damned"); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tunnel setting actively constrains choices: puddles hide evidence, dripping water guides discovery, wet concrete enables scalpel staging; final image charges lantern through micro-setting evolution from tool to legacy armor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via protagonist agency when footprint evidence forces tactical shift from observation to rebellion; cost legible in "long-dormant part finally breathed free" as conceptual price of integrity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through lantern's transformation from memory trigger to armor; final image ("quiet rebellion against shadows") resonates without moralizing, reweighting legacy as active resistance against bureaucratic silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "water dripped... reverberate through narrow space" showing selective attention under stress; rhythmic control in "lantern held high" crystallizes resolve without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "splashing in shallow puddles" and "dripped steadily" create sonic propulsion; minor abstraction in "vulnerability fortified" avoided therapy-speak by grounding in tactile wall contact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms procedural trope through Underground Railroad lantern motif; drought's end isn't backdrop but active murder-staging tool; emotional specificity in "scalpel crusted with dried blood" avoids generic corruption narratives.</comment>
