<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's yearning for change ("transpose life into a new key") conflicts with duty, driving her decisive beam adjustment; exhaustion and identity shift manifest visible cost without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: beam redirection saves ship with legible cost (her slumped exhaustion, "life's key shifted"); causal lens holds via Chen's specs enabling action when sea "sings backwards".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse beam specs constrain choice (emergency array adjustment) and charge closure: final "silent conductor" image reweights tool as symphonic instrument, avoiding symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elara's agency—narrowing beam per specs under storm pressure—forecloses survival option with felt cost (physical/emotional exhaustion crystallizing her new role).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Open secrets" theme resolves through action: microdot specs become legible only during crisis, with final image ("secrets hiding in the open") offering non-literal answer to yearning vs. duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "sucking song" of sea and "dusty lenses" filtered through keeper's expertise; rhythm tightens under stress ("fingers flying") without voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffold: "searing, narrow lance" crystallizes beam adjustment; no figurative muddle in climax; final line ("mysterious symphony") recharges "transpose" motif with propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spycraft microdot transforms "accidentally prophetic" trope into practical salvation tool; risk-taking (lighthouse as signaling array) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
