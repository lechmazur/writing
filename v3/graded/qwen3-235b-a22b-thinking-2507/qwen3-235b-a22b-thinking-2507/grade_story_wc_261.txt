<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (seeking closure vs reopening wounds) drives action; embodied emotion in scar memory via coffee rings avoids therapy-speak; micro-choice to tunnel earns endurance with visible cost of thorns and silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands when hourglass frost vanishes and he traces his scar—cost is permanent loss of telepathy crystallized in "Silence. The fern’s voice gone." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse tower constrains choice (tunneling through ivy wall); recurring scar motif charges final image—abdominal ridge transforms from "wound to dissect" to "testament" under dawn light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via hourglass frost melting (one meaningful escalation); cost is visceral—thorns tearing gown during tunneling, then irreversible silence after frost vanishes, reweighting his purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through scar-as-story metaphor; final image ("trace the ridge... testament") reweights premise without moralizing—love persists beyond saving, rejecting closure-seeking for listening.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("vines whispered secrets through fingertips"); rhythm modulates from "slow retreat of anesthesia" to frantic tunneling, with patterned "meteor hush" payoff in silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "desperate, he examined..." slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise high density—coffee rings resolving into scar memory compresses backstory with zero redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical trauma and botanical telepathy; "displaced miracle" reframes Arctic ice as fragile time-pocket, transforming cliché into specific emotional logic with scarred body as true miracle.</comment>
