<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines with embodied emotion ("sweat on solemn face," heart hammering) and contradictory impulses (determination vs. retrocognitive drowning), but lacks deeper flaw-driven mistakes that compound before resolution. Micro-choices under pressure (debris arrangement) earn the final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change: key discovery breaks retrocognitive trap with felt cost ("burden he could carry forward"). Causal lens holds—debris arrangement directly triggers the X's glow and discovery. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (hiding place) and charges the final image (stone embedded in glass). Sensory details like "salty tang of fear" and "cool black sand" are urgent, selective, and filtered through Elias's archivist lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking retrocognitive trap) tightens through Elias's agency: debris arrangement causes the X's glow, narrowing options to the lagoon's edge. Cost is unmistakable—"weight of silenced voices" now a carried burden—though escalation could deepen the internal/external conflict weave.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through action: the final image of tears on his face while holding the key reweights "burden" as both weight and clarity, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo; complexity in "clear-eyed and unbroken" resonates without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: archivist's tactile focus ("smudged with lagoon sediment," "fragments of driftwood") and rhythmic control under pressure (fragmented visions vs. lyrical closure). Minor register drift in "retrocognitively trapped sorrow" fits character but slightly jars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("He scrambled down... boots sinking"). Figurative language ("lagoon reflected... like a wound") serves urgency without muddle. Final line crystallizes closure with clean syntax and textural specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: retrocognition as active burden and debris as time-parley transforms civil rights trope. Emotional truth in "burden... clear-eyed and unbroken" avoids abstraction. Specific details (oilcloth-wrapped key, obsidian fossilization) ground the risk-taking without gimmickry.</comment>
