<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("shameful jealousy" vs "jaded shell") manifests physically through scroll-carving as surgery; micro-choice to acknowledge past self transforms envy into flight with visible cost ("weight lifted"). No diagnostic label-speak despite high-stakes crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: soaring as "something new" crystallizes stance after admitting envy, reweighting chronology with felt cost ("jaded wonder of having touched both abysses"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density escalation to final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll constrains choice (unforgiving surface) and charges final image (glowing words); cabin's chill vs dream wind creates sensory hierarchy that mirrors internal fracture. Micro-setting actively shapes tactics during writing "surgery".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: acknowledging envy ("I see you") transforms pressure rather than resolves it, narrowing options to integration. Felt cost ("weight lifted") reconfigures chronology without erasing temporal fracture, deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: envy-for-past-self becomes fuel for flight, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("jaded wonder... touched both abysses") offers non-literal answer to "why that past self?" without stating thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("feral nostalgia clawed", "wind singing") modulates under stress; rhythm shifts from fragmented dread to flowing flight. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens during dream surge ("she was *there*").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-duplicate ("chaos had bled into waking life"/"fought to contain") triggers −0.2; otherwise high density ("writing felt like surgery") with zero figurative muddle in peak beats. Final image propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "seeing own grave" trope through chronologically confused fracture and feral nostalgia as active force. Risk-taking (dream-as-antagonist) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("birch bark", "soot-thickened water") grounds universality.</comment>
