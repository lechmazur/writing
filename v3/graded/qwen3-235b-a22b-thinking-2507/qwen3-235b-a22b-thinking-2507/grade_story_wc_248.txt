<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "not a criminal; she was a guardian" and tear-blurred vision at the blank scroll, but "volcanic tenderness" borders on diagnostic label-speak during peak emotion, slightly undermining embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as potent Charged Poise: sealing the entrance while carrying "steady warmth" crystallizes her keeper stance with visible cost in the ash veil and tears; Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly through puzzle density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Volcanic rock setting actively constrains descent (sulfur heat) and charges the final image via "volcanic tenderness" motif; charcoal stick functions as micro-setting that recharges closure through library ashes callback.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake ("rescue promise") tightens texturally through puzzle-solving; agency in reassembling fragments drives escalation, with cost legible in tears and the ash veil's temporary protection of the mural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the blank scroll's erasure and charcoal renewal—avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "forgotten" as active guardianship without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "analytically intuitive mind" and glyph-tracing details, but "volcanic tenderness" repetition creates slight register drift from archaeologist POV into elevated abstraction during high pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density overall with strong verbs ("pulped," "groaned"), but "volcanic tenderness" loop (3x) creates paraphrase redundancy in the final beats, slightly dulling the closure image's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis transforms "lending library arsonist" trope through specific moral calculus (hiding truth in flames); bold "keeper not revealer" resolution avoids safety middle while feeling inevitable from prior particulars.</comment>
