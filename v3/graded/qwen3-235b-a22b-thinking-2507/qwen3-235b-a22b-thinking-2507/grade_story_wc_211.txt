<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices (cradling shaving vs burning skin), but Ugaritic fluency borders on convenient knowledge leap despite setup; micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values with visceral cost in the silent scream archive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("last thing he archived was his own silent scream"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through density increase to glass-apple transformation; no causality breaks in the single tightening beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orchard roots gripping skyscraper steel directly constrain choice (Elias must witness transformation), charging the final image; minor deduction for "velvet disquiet" occasionally drifting toward thematic shorthand rather than sensory filter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elias' agency (choosing immersion) with unmistakable cost (dread as new emotional pattern); single tightening reweights stakes from preservation to containment with "pure, untranslatable loss" crystallizing the conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (glass apples as archive's purpose revealed), avoiding moralizing; final image ("roots awoke") offers resonant non-literal answer though childhood memory integration slightly over-explains the key.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("exhaled a scent of decaying apples") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in climax ("conceptual repricing" equivalent phrases) prevents 9.0 despite taught patterned elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("shattered on concrete into crystalline shards"), but final paragraph's template cadence ("The orchard shuddered. More apples fell...") triggers -0.3 deduction; avoids closure-touching artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive tropes through specific details (oath scribe, phonograph shavings), though "velvet disquiet" risks mannerism; emotional specificity avoids genericity but lacks one unforgettable transformative detail for 9.0.</comment>
