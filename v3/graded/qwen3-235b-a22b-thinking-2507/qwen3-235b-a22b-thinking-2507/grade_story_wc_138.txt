<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority vividly concrete ("boredom settled into his bones like sediment") and motivation crystallizes through embodied micro-choices (recalling city consumed by amulet). Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during climax—hesitation feels sequential rather than layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: solar storm enables mutiny, which Aeon exploits, culminating in amulet's sacrifice. Closure as Charged Poise lands with irrefutable cost ("the amulet gone. The crushing boredom had lifted"). Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite constrains choices (distortions force navigation tactics) and charges final image ("clean scent of rain on stone" reweights earlier chaos). Slight spatial choreography gaps during inversions limit 9.0 eligibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally: mutiny intensifies as Aeon channels storm, narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost ("amulet gone") visibly alters his state ("boredom lifted"). Agency drives every tightening under causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "goodbye wasn't a wall; it was a membrane" reweights premise without moralizing. Final image’s "clean scent of rain" resonates with earned ambiguity—no thematic echo or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dimensionally aware, perceiving magnetic fields as luminous threads") modulates rhythm under pressure. Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in immortal’s lexicon ("Eternal boredom had settled into his bones").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Propulsion flawless with high density ("liquid starlight" replaces abstraction), though "pulsed with hushed thunder of collapsing magnetic fields" slightly strains coherence. Zero loops or scaffold; final line crystalline.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic tropes through specific emotional calculus ("salt and silence" city memory). "Goodbye as membrane" feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (quiet closure) heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
