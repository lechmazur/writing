<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied micro-choices (scarf tightening as ritual peaks), avoiding epiphanies; transformation from seeker to guardian earns cost via physical warmth spreading up her spine. No second character needed for pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with palpable cost—the shift from "seeker" to "guardian" crystallized by the scarf’s final settlement—under Accumulative/Textural lens. Density peaks cleanly when postcard ink bleeds into wood grain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Library’s warped geometry actively constrains ritual tactics (hyperbolic spiral placement), charging the final image where the scarf "cradles the world’s quietest miracle." Micro-setting (patrons’ oblivious browsing) pressures her focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara’s agency: arranging objects amid patrons narrows options to one precise ritual, with cost legible in the scarf’s vibration and physical warmth. Single tightening suffices for this Accumulative design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars—the scarf’s shift from "relic" to "compass" to "guardian" symbol—without moralizing. Final image ("cradling the world’s quietest miracle") reweights the quest as quiet stewardship, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature dazzles ("dust motes dancing above patrons," "frayed edges whispering"); rhythm modulates from lyrical ("soft rustle of patrons browsing") to taut precision during the ritual. Zero head-hopping despite multi-character space.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or pressure ("postcard’s ink bleed into the wood grain"). Final line’s "cradling the world’s quietest miracle" delivers crystalline closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-living-archive trope through hyperbolic geometry and analog fragments. Transformation test passes: removing the scarf’s physicality would collapse the emotional arc, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
