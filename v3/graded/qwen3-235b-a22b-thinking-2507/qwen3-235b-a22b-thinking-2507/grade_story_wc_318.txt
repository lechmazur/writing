<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines ("mournfully eager" heart vs. suffocating stillness), but closure choice (stopping blowers) lacks visible tradeoffs; laughter's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned by her agency despite strong embodied grief ("knuckles white," "voice cracking").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("unspoken grief not gone, but held"), yet the Accumulative lens falters—wind carrying laughter resolves grief through coincidence, not protagonist-driven pressure; orientation clears by 50 words but resolution lacks causal teeth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tunnel ribs and vents function as micro-setting that constrains choice (directing wind upward) and charges the final image ("laughter drifting back down the stone throat"); concrete tools (blowers) alter tactics through physicality ("frayed rope worn smooth").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes (transforming grief) deepen via sensory density, but escalation isn't protagonist-driven; Elara's ritual is predetermined, not adaptive, making laughter's arrival feel coincidental rather than earned under Accumulative lens despite strong pressure buildup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through visceral particulars ("shredding leaves into golden-brown mist like suspended tears"), avoiding moralizing; final image ("unspoken grief not gone, but held") resonates as non-literal answer to "can grief be carried home?" with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced in dying light") and rhythmic control under pressure ("engine coughed, sputtered, then roared") showcase voice; free indirect style merges narration with Elara's psyche without filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor density risks ("wind’s raw sighs and earth’s whispered regrets") but no closure-impacting loops; "suspended tears" metaphor slightly muddles physical logic yet propels momentum with strong verbs ("macerated," "shredding," "surged").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief ritual via leaf-blower symphony feels inevitable; transforms mundane tool into emotional conduit without gimmickry, charging closure through specific physicality ("pull cord handle slick in her palm").</comment>
