<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied contradiction shines in "furiously tranquil" state—hammering heart vs steady hands during ritual—but lacks deeper flaw-driven struggle beyond physical strain, slightly thinning endurance cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: the hollow warmth post-hatching and meltwater drop shatter crystallize irreversible change, though entropy reversal mechanics feel slightly undersold as active choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Icebound atrium actively constrains choice—cold stinging skin, ice groans dictating breath rhythm—and final meltwater drop charges closure with undeniable environmental consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density ("rough velvet of ancient bark"), but cost remains physical (stinging skin) without deeper emotional forfeiture; entropy reversal lacks tangible tactical tradeoff beyond concentration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through texture: "borrowed time" as lived earth sensation reweights the premise in the final image without moralizing, avoiding abstraction through concrete sensory legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice distills Elara’s perceptual signature ("frost feathers blooming"), but filter verbs ("she felt only") and "furiously tranquil" slightly intrude into therapyspeak during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via precise verbs ("refracting," "groaning"), though "war-drum rhythm" cliché slightly dulls the ritual’s climax without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms entropy concept through sensory time-weaving; risk-taking in textural escalation feels inevitable, though "last guardian" trope edges toward archetype without deeper subversion.</comment>
