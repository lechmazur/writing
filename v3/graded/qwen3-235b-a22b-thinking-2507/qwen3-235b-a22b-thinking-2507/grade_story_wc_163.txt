<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction in displacement ("neither surface nor deep") and embodied micro-choice with feather clutch elevate characterization; minor deduction for over-articulated fire-regrowth insight bordering on diagnostic label-speak in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise via shared exhale/fireflies with felt cost in "frantic search for belonging ceased"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as plankton agitation→recalibration→jellyfish reweights belonging through sensory density.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thalassar's pressure-hum and corroded grate create lived-in specificity; feather's implausible survival from wildfire breaks oceanic credibility, undermining setting's causal role in inciting incident.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen via plankton distress forcing recalibration gamble; sunrise deadline lacks tactical pressure as Elara acts identically regardless of timing, missing one escalation gate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Wonder bloomed from burnt places" finale risks thematic echo but avoids moralizing through visceral firefly imagery; feather-to-rebirth motif earns subtext via concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "liquid maps only she could decipher"; rhythmic control peaks in "fireflies of the deep" cadence; zero head-hopping despite dual-character closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phosphorescent currents swirling" avoids modifier redundancy through purposeful lyricism; final line’s "burnt places" metaphor crystallizes without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Underwater astrologer premise transforms tropes via sensory specificity; feather/jellyfish synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh, though wildfire origin strains plausibility.</comment>
