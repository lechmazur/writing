<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's embodied exhaustion and trembling focus create credible contradiction; "teeth ache" grounds dissonance physically. Final choice to invert chaos earns closure through map knowledge, but "hammered repose" flirts with therapy-speak (-0.3).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "silence itself was the truest guide" reconfigures stakes with visceral cost ("exhaustion washed over her... deeper than any"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density tightening to the bloom.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ice fractures constrain choice (locating convergence point) and charge closure ("caves breathed again"). Micro-setting functions as acoustic map; environment actively shapes tactics via crack patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally: dissonant shriek → weak stone flicker → hairline fissures → bloom. Cost is palpable ("teeth ache" resolving to "breath slowed"), but escalation leans slightly passive awaiting stone's bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "bloom of hush" reweighting chaos as harmony; "silence itself was the truest guide" avoids moralizing. "Hammered repose" slightly echoes prompt language (-0.2), risking thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ripple-marks," "frozen lightning") modulates rhythm from jagged to flowing. Filter verb "she saw it" in high-pressure beat and "hammered repose" register drift (-0.3).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm to mirror acoustic shifts. "Hammered repose" is stock phrase (-0.4), and "profound, vibrating calm" slightly overwrites, but final image ("silt finding riverbed") saves propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ritual trope via acoustic specificity (crack patterns as sound maps). "Bloom of hush" is fresh inflection, though "energy beings" feel generic (-0.3). Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
