<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through simultaneous fear/arrogance ghosts, but "motivation burned fierce" uses label without embodiment, triggering minor diagnostic penalty despite otherwise concrete choices like walking through younger self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands via Charged Poise ("labyrinth isn't out there... path you walk now") with visible cost in kneeling "grounded" posture; Accumulative lens holds through rain/viaduct density reweighting fragmentation as strength.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rain-slick viaduct functions as micro-setting constraining choices (narrow archways, puddle reflections) and charges final image ("wet stone holding the sky"), transforming from glowing path to ordinary reality with thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through textural escalation ("shadows whispering failures" making abstract regret visceral), with protagonist's stance shift (rejecting false selves) driving pressure toward Earned Stasis closure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration ("fractured timelines weren't broken, but branching") avoiding moralizing; final image of "unburdened" steps offers non-literal resolution where "fractured pieces remained" embraces complexity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised dawn sky," "sickly brightness") modulates under pressure, but "periodically eternal" feels detached from Kael's lexicon, slightly disrupting rhythmic control during high-stakes ascent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional density and propulsion until "darkening brightness reached its zenith" – mixed metaphor (brightness can't darken) dulls closure image; otherwise flawless syntactic variety and sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via procedural tablet mechanics and psychological viaduct; emotional specificity in "abandoned sister" memory avoids generic templates while risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
