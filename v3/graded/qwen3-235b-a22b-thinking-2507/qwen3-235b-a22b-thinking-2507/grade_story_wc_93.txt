<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s shift from forcing sequences to surrendering; embodied cost in "hollow ache" and trembling hands. Minor abstraction in final realization slightly dilutes visceral impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: fleeting understanding’s "hollow ache" forecloses control. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through density shift when dust ignites luminous equations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tidal bluff actively pressures choices—slippery stones break sequences, churning sea threatens. Star dust’s ignition charges final image, constraining Kael’s pivotal micro-choice to scatter stones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: rigid sequences fail, surrender enables vision. Cost is legible in "fleeting understanding," but "hollow ache" lacks concrete physicality to fully maximize emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "patterns breathe" realized via scattered stones, not stated. Final image of herding "moments of clarity" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the promise’s meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in marine metaphors ("despair coiled like a trapped eel"); rhythm accelerates during vision. Zero register drift—stress compresses diction to "He obeyed," "stone clicking."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "salt-crusted rocks threatened to slide" does triple duty. Slight overwriting in "ghostly ribbons bleeding" risks density, but payoff in aurora’s crimson flare justifies it. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precognition as key (not flaw) transforms trope. Risk-taking in closure—understanding as transient act—heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable through prior pattern failures.</comment>
