<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rebellious mind" vs. academic dismissal; embodied tears at confirmation feel earned, not therapized. Micro-choice of scraping soil crystallizes her hierarchy of values under pressure. Lacks secondary character pressure but scope excuses this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands: "home was never a destination, but a reaction" reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (solitude vs. universal truth). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via sensory/data buildup. Cost proof: "tears pricked her eyes" + vial warmth crystallizes emotional price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower isn't backdrop but active constraint—limestone chemistry solves the mystery. Fly amber shifts from relic to closure-charging object ("warm against her skin"). Micro-setting (spectrometer screen) directly shapes the final image and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: scraping soil → mixing samples → data spike. Pilgrims' footprints create secondary pressure (oblivious masses vs. her focused science). Cost is unmistakable in solitary tears and the weight of carrying proof alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "home as reaction" crystallized without moralizing. Final line reweights the premise through concrete chemistry, avoiding thematic echo. Pilgrims' spiritual seeking gains complexity without false equivalence—truth is in the soil, not stars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "saw only mineral deposits," not sculptures. Rhythm modulates from lyrical setup ("bronze quiet settled") to staccato climax ("Data scrolled... a spike"). Zero register drift; scientific lexicon stays character-bound under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; every phrase propels: "fly amber glowed with trapped golden light" does triple duty (image, object, foreshadowing). Pressure beats use concrete verbs ("scraped," "activated") without figurative muddle. Final line’s cadence crystallizes theme flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms first-contact trope: aliens communicate via chemistry, not language. Cretaceous fly amber + spring-rain isotopes ground universality in specific, verifiable detail. Risk-taking (scientific closure over spiritual) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
