<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (observe vs. interact) drive pivotal micro-choices; shell pickup and final placement earn closure with conceptual cost. Flaws compound authentically without safety-hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure (CR) lands via shell's evolving images reweighting time's nature with felt cost ("humanity wasn’t ready"). Hybrid lens holds: causal discovery (shell) enables accumulative reconfiguration. Orientation clear by 80 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Astral Orchard constrains choices (bathroom retreat, shell interaction); regolith placement charges final image. Micro-setting (bathroom) forces reflection that alters tactics. Sensory detail selective and urgency-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (linear vs. non-linear time) tightens via bathroom realization, narrowing options to participation in the loop. Conceptual cost ("shattered illusion") legible in final placement. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through shell's evolution and orchard's "remembering," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("eternal tapestry") reweights time as garden without stating moral. Complexity embraced via irreversible conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("brightened disquiet," "simply complicated") filters all description. Bathroom compression taught early and paid off; rhythmic control under pressure avoids ventriloquism. No head-hopping; voice modulates with realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "frozen stars" metaphor earns density without muddle. Final line ("starlit peace") resolves with textural specificity. Propulsion maintained through syntactic variety and strategic telling ("simply complicated").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms time-travel tropes via pistachio shell heirloom; emotional truth in curator's awe avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (non-linear closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable through orchard's "remembering" reconfiguration.</comment>
