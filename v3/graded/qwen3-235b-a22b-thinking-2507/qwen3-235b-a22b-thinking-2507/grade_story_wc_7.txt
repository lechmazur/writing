<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines as she tastes sorrow while pruning for hope, but "informally wise" remains descriptive rather than driving a concrete trade-off with visible cost during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: her vigilance pays off with the shoot's emergence, and the physical cost ("exhaustion tugged... but she stayed") legibly forecloses despair under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse actively constrains her (kneeling on gravel, caved roof) and charges the final image ("breathed anew"); recurring objects like blackberries evolve meaningfully from decay to reclaimed joy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through her pruning choices—releasing bitter memories to clear space for hope—with visible cost in physical exhaustion; cosmic alignment slightly softens pressure by making the shoot's growth feel convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars ("gentle rebellion" shown via seeds not shouts), but synaptic plasticity explanations risk thematic echo, narrowly avoiding penalty by being character-bound ("science she barely understood").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is flawless—taste as memory conduit shapes all description ("stung like burnt sugar")—with rhythm modulating under stress; minor register drift in "synaptic plasticity" stays plausible through her limited understanding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances texture (e.g., "rust devoured support beams" showing decay). "Informally wise" repetition earns its keep by linking to grandmother's wisdom without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes through specific sensory mechanics—tasting memories via food becomes emotional labor in pruning—but cosmic alignment's convenience slightly undercuts the fresh premise's rigor.</comment>
