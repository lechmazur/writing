<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via "luminous skeptic" tension; embodied micro-choices like lip-licking reveal character under pressure. Final realization earned through prior causality but cost remains oblique—closure lacks visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: carriers' convergence creates biosphere equilibrium with felt cost (copper taste fading). Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density reweights stakes. Minor cost ambiguity prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora actively constrain choices (ring reflects microclimates), charging the final image. Sensory specificity—crushed lavender scent, copper taste—evolves with pressure. Environment directly enables the convergence climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding carriers) tightens through Aris' sensory escalation (taste shifts). Agency-driven escalation culminates in earned realization, but the cost—emotional shift rather than tangible loss—feels slightly underweighted for high-band entry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "forests electing mycorrhizal networks" reframes carriers as stewards. Final line ("remember how to hold the sky") avoids moralizing by charging prior material, though "futuristic nostalgia" risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora bled emerald," "cosmic static") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in high-stakes beats ("taste of burnt sage and dust"). Zero head-hopping; elision of carrier backstories taught early via ring's function.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion falters slightly in reflective beats ("memories of simpler storms"), but information density remains high. Minor scaffold ("she thought bitterly") avoids penalty; final image’s sensory shift ("clean scent of lavender") crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope via scientific framing—carriers as elected stewards. Specificity (mycorrhizal democracy, taste-based sensing) grounds universality. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
