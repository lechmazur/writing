<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses (duty vs resentment) manifest in ungraceful efficiency; trembling hands during path assembly reveal embodied cost. Travelers function only as plot devices, lacking interaction to deepen stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (vanishing blueprint ink signaling fading hope), but blueprint mechanics feel slightly convenient—why breath paths evade birds lacks causal grounding despite Accumulative lens coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nut’s coolness and frosted retrieval constrain choices while charging the final image; labyrinth thorns and frost actively pressure navigation. Environment isn’t backdrop but tactical constraint throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Agency-driven escalation via Elara’s path assembly narrows options (frost deadline/bird patrols), with visceral cost in trembling hands. Stakes deepen when guiding travelers crystallizes as potential soul-freedom path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "graceless beauty" in ungraceful movements creating lifesaving paths; final question about freedom avoids moralizing while reweighting the nut’s significance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "skeletal branches" and "copper wings that whirred," with rhythmic control during breath-fogging. Minor register drift in "grim necessity" slightly undermines voice cohesion under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure-touching artifacts, but "offhandedly exact" repeats without progression and "frost would come/seal" creates subtle paraphrase loop. Propulsion remains strong yet prevents 9+ band entry.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Assembly through absence" transforms cursed orchard tropes with emotional specificity; mechanical birds and breath-path method synthesize organically. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
