<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's contradictory impulses (defiance vs. connection) manifest in the quartz-raising choice; Vanya's tears show embodied cost. "Innocently mischievous" risks abstraction but is redeemed by children's giggles during poetry sessions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Vanya's dust-traced tears and transformed command reconfigure ritual meaning. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density (echoes→light→harmony) with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers function as micro-setting: quartz refraction charges the final image by painting "multicolored truths" on walls. Canyon's "forged hush" evolves from oppressive weight to "fragile harmony," constraining Kael's every action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kael's agency: louder poetry session → Vanya's ultimatum → light refraction. Cost crystallizes in Vanya's "painful clarity" as she surrenders rigid doctrine. Accumulative pressure intensifies through sensory density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through refracted light imagery, not moralizing. Final line "fragile, multifaceted harmony" answers "must silence be the only hymn?" non-literally. Avoids Thematic Echo despite Kael's "cage" declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "echoes bounced like trapped ghosts" filters canyon through Kael's artistic lens. Dialogue subtext ("price for defiance is steep") carries goal pursuit. Minor register drift in "refract a single truth" but quickly anchored.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "splintered light dancing" demonstrates rhythmic propulsion. "Forged hush" recurrence is pattern-taught and payoff-charged. No figurative muddle even in peak refraction beat where stakes climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms silence/truth trope through bone towers as literal truth-canvases. Emotional specificity in children's giggles during rhymes avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (refraction as conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
