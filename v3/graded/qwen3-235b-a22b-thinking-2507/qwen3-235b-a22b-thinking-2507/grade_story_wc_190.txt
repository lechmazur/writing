<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (sorrow/solace) manifests in micro-choices like decibel modulation; embodied emotion through vial's physicality avoids labels. Final endurance (humming) earns closure with visible cost in the terrace's sigh.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the cleared storm glass and transformed silence reconfigure the terrace's meaning. Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (32→35 dB) with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prism terrace constrains every choice (humming intensity, gondola navigation); final honeyed light charges closure by reweighting opening "fractured light." Sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) reflects urgency without checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: vial's cloudiness forces decibel calibration under accumulating pressure. Dominant stake (silence as balm) tightens via 35 dB sweet spot with felt cost in the "brittle" held breath becoming a cradle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action (humming dissolving "amber" trauma), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("silence learned its purpose") reweights the central question without stating a moral, embracing complexity through the woman's release tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fluidly logical" calibration, acoustic focus) persists under stress; rhythmic control modulates with decibel shifts. No head-hopping; elision of Venetia's off-page sleep taught early and pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("milky agitation" → "liquid calm") with propulsion. One borderline poetic phrase ("vaulting hush") avoids muddle through consistent acoustic motif. Final line’s "breath no longer" crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic ecology and trauma recovery: storm glass as emotional barometer transforms clichés. Risk-taking (silence as active force) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("32 decibels") grounds universality.</comment>
