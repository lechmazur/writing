<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction ("free and adrift") but lacks visceral struggle pre-revelation; micro-choices like palm-pressing earn closure though emotional progression leans slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: star imprint on skin crystallizes cost of broken leash, but the frayed rope’s irreversible loss needs sharper physical manifestation to elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Black sand star-hollow constrains choice (kneeling/palm-press) and charges final image; mist/water reflections mirror internal state without cliché, though "damp shroud" edges toward stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via twilight’s deepening and ferry crossing under Accumulative lens; courage-as-crossing realization reweights options, but the leash break’s cost lacks visceral on-page demonstration beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Final image ("courage... stirred") offers non-literal answer to vigil’s purpose; theme emerges through star-hollow action without moralizing, though "unused courage" risks abstraction without the sand’s tangible charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("shoreline lullaby" rhythm) modulates under pressure; free indirect style clean, but "frayed rope" metaphor slightly generic for pivotal backstory moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No scaffold loops; "damp shroud" and "lullaby" metaphors border cliché but gain specificity through recurrence; rhythm accelerates subtly during ferry glide, though twilight description over-embellishes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "courage" trope via journey-as-activation; star-hollow synthesis feels inevitable, though ridgeway/ferry framework echoes archetypal thresholds without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
