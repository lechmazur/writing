<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but interior contradiction underdeveloped; "spark" metaphor remains abstract despite embodied planting actions. Micro-choices lack layered conflict beneath surface resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: garden's hum disrupts Harmonizers with visible cost (woman's anger flicker). Hybrid lens (causal planting + accumulative pattern) holds through final "converging chaos" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gourd rattle seed constrains all choices and charges the final image—its vibration literally alters the Harmonizer's effect. Soil texture and drone hum integrate action while avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally: dawn deadline forces planting before drone sweep. Cost is legible via the fragile "flicker of unbidden anger" amid oppressive surveillance, narrowing options to this single garden gambit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete garden mechanics: "geometry of resistance" made literal by seed-pattern vibrations. Final image reweights dissent as chaotic yet vital hum—no moralizing, only embodied cost in the child's "sharp, too free" laugh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: entomologist's lens shapes detail selection ("trembling wings," "aphid examination"). Rhythmic control under pressure with drone hum woven into syntax; no head-hopping despite dual characters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding—every line advances plot or theme. "Dry rattle a promise" compresses backstory into propulsion. Final paragraph’s cadence shift ("hummed back... dissonance vibrated") embodies resistance without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gardening/spy tropes: gourd vibrations as counter-frequency feels inevitable yet revelatory. Avoids abstraction through specific mechanics (seed arrangement, drone recalibration), though "taxed sorrow" concept lacks full transformation.</comment>
