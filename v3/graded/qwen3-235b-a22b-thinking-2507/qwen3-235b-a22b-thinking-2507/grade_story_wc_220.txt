<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied scent logic and the leaf's tactile memory; micro-choice of using it as lens reveals contradictory hope/despair without therapy-speak. Final endurance (following the map) earns closure with visible cost of years wasted searching for bodies instead of home.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the shift from "oppressive" to "expectant" hush crystallizes Silas' reconfigured stance with visceral cost (tears, wasted years). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the cylinder's meaning emerges through sensory accumulation, not causal beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Scrapyard bones and wax leaf constrain every choice; the leaf charges the final image by warming against fur while revealing the map. Sensory hierarchy is flawless—oxidized copper = danger, cooking oil = meal—filtering the world through a bloodhound's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating distance into closeness) tightens when the cylinder's failure forces Silas to reinterpret the leaf as a tool, narrowing options to "follow east or stay broken." Cost is legible in his tears and the years spent digging for corpses instead of home.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" avoids moralizing by making the theme actionable: the leaf’s distortion literally reweights the cylinder’s grooves into hope. Final image of breathing lavender scent offers resonant, non-literal answer to "closeness" without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful—world filtered through scent/memory ("crisp veins preserved forever in clear wax"). Rhythmic control peaks when "sunlight, weak and late" slants through tin, compressing diction under pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold; "tinted revelations" crystallizes multiple functions in three words. Minor overwriting in "bruised twilight sky" slightly dilutes momentum, but "wild hush" repetition earns its keep through charged modulation from oppressive to expectant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes bloodhound logic and phonograph tech into fresh emotional calculus: scent-tracker must shift to sight-reader. Risk-taking (sound-to-text cylinder) heightens stakes without gimmickry—the leaf’s lens function feels inevitable by closure.</comment>
