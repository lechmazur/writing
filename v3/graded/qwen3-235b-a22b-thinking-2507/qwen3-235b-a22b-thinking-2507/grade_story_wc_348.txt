<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied grief ("hollow space inside him") and scientific observation; micro-choices like placing the chrysalis on the boulder reveal value hierarchy with visible cost in the final pebble ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "grief now a companion rather than a captor" crystallizes the shift from rigidity to fluid acceptance under Accumulative/Textural lens, with the ravine’s converging streams embodying the reconfigured stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The braided ravine’s waterways actively constrain choices—foam patterns inspire the polymer breakthrough, and the converging streams directly charge the final image of "fractures becoming bridges," fulfilling micro-setting necessity for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Aris’s agency: observing river foam transforms abstract grief into actionable insight ("separation wasn’t termination but transformation"), with the felt cost of "loosened grief" altering his tactics toward healing polymers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the river’s braiding and chrysalis, avoiding moralizing; the final pebble image—"all fractures might yet become bridges"—resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (polymer scientist seeing "molecular chains" in foam) and rhythmic control peak during the insight: "Water didn’t mourn split paths; it adapted" compresses diction without losing voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "grief had tightened like cross-linked polymers" slightly over-extends the metaphor into the next clause, creating minor density strain in a high-pressure beat without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science and grief avoids tropes; the "healing through intentional fracture" premise transforms familiar material through verifiable detail (river foam’s Fibonacci patterns inspiring hydrogels), feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
