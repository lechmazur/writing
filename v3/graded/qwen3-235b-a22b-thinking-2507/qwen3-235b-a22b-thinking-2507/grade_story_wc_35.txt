<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "drown or distill" choice; embodied emotion ("trembling hands," "palms no longer shaking") roots motivation. Minor slip: "salty and cold as glacier melt" slightly clinical for peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—"shoulders slumped with relief" crystallizes communal release with undeniable cost. Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through tidal pool pattern to broth transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert micro-setting actively constrains: rain creates pools guiding excavation, kitchen enables distillation. Final image ("fortress standing strong") charged by "sturdy yet brittle" texture, though dune pressure could deepen mid-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven solely by Elara's agency: analyzing pools → digging → subsuming remorse → distilling broth. Cost unmistakable as her memory "sharpening instead of sanding," foreclosing solitary erasure for communal endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "sandpaper" motif evolving from solitary act to shared broth; final image ("make memory tender") reweights without moralizing. Avoids Thematic Echo entirely—wisdom earned through sensory labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chef POV shapes every perception ("taste memories," "broth reducing to essence"); rhythm tightens under stress ("steam rose, carrying the taste of tears"). Slight register drift in "emotionally contagious" description.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, but "salty and cold as glacier melt" creates subtle metaphor clash; adjacent synonym loops ("rough memories"/"jagged as broken pottery") minorly dull momentum in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "taste memories" trope via chef-specific logic; coral pavilion as remorse crucible feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity—communal grief as culinary process.</comment>
