<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "adrift" yet actively stitching fragments; final choice as archivist earned by tactile progression from hollow ache to etching stories. Slight abstraction in "seeking patterns" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with "identity was a choice" and label pressed into earth—conceptual cost undeniable. Tidal rhythm drives accumulative escalation flawlessly; only minor convenience in final whisper slightly softens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: poison label's texture charges the ending while tides actively constrain movement ("rising water lapping hungrily"). Mudflats and containers aren't backdrop but physical manifestation of erased identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: collecting → etching → claiming archivist role. Dominant identity-reclamation stake reweights with each fragment, though cost remains slightly abstract beyond emotional toll ("hollow ache").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: "texture of memory was mud and metal" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of labyrinth "holding its breath" resonates as non-literal answer to erased history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless—"filtering reality through layers of absence" shapes every image. Rhythmic control shifts with tides (e.g., short sentences during rising water), though "reality shifted" slightly generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "calloused fingers like forgotten skin" exemplifies high-density textural specificity. Only "fragile survival" borders cliché—minor flaw preventing 10.0 in peak prose craftsmanship.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure with tidal physics transforms common premise. Emotional specificity ("grief felt like wet sand") avoids novelty-for-its-own-sake; risk-taking elevates stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
