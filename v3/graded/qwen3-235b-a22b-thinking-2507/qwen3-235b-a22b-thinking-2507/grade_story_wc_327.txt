<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vivid but lacks contradictory impulses; dedication to duty overshadows potential conflict between preserving language and accepting its death. Final renunciation feels earned yet incomplete without deeper internal tension during the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: diamond's destruction forecloses the method with visible cost ("dark and lifeless"), while the sonic imprint creates conceptual reweighting. Accumulative lens holds as sensory density builds to the fracture's irreversible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Flawed diamond functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (dark stone vs. lingering texture), but canyon towers remain atmospheric rather than tactical constraints. Bone texture description brilliantly filters through Kael's sensory priorities during the touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency: dancing to harness starlings transforms abstract goal into embodied action. The diamond's flaw creates inevitable trade-off (control vs. destruction), with cost unmistakable in the abrupt silence after the crack echoes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "translating texture into sound" as cultural preservation metaphor. Final line ("a victory across his language's death") resonates without moralizing, reweighting the premise through embodied loss rather than abstract victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in tactile vocabulary ("porous texture," "tiny holes") that modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control peaks during the dance sequence—short phrases mirror starling patterns without sacrificing lyrical density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resonant hum emerged... physical sensation translated into pure tone" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor overwriting risk in "symphony of whispers trapped in time" avoids muddle through consistent sonic motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "dying language" trope via sensory innovation—texture-as-lexicon feels inevitable. Risk-taking in using bird flight as acoustic conduit heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing biology and artistry into fresh cultural elegy.</comment>
