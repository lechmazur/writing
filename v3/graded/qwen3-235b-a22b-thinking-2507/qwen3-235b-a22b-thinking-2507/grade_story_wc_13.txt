<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when frustration over "hollow" moth illustrations contrasts with rhythmic urgency; embodied exhaustion post-crisis ("Exhaustion hit") avoids therapy-speak. Slight over-reliance on pendant as emotional barometer weakens micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost ("Exhaustion hit") and conceptual repricing ("echoes weren’t born from silence"). Accumulative lens holds: sensory density (water cadence, pendant heat) tightens into decisive clang. Giant’s unawareness preserves causal integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system constrains choice (kneeling at confluence) and charges final image (sketchbook holding "living pulse"). Obsidian walls’ "Clang" becomes tactile pressure point. Moth illustrations feel underutilized for sensory hierarchy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via interrupted cadence’s escalation from observation ("discordant pattern") to physical disruption ("dip sketching knife"). Cost is embodied (burning pendant, exhaustion) and conceptual (redefining echoes). Giant’s breath as live clock lacks mid-beat urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "uncaging" echoes reweights silence as courage, not absence. Final line ("natural history") crystallizes non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids "Thematic Echo" by grounding wisdom in silver birds’ release.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("natural history illustrator’s eye") filters canal light through professional bias. Rhythmic control peaks during borrowed time ("dripping water to molasses"). Slight register drift in "temporal fracture" risks academic diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "shimmering surface" to "living pulse" progression shows textural specificity. "Stretched thin like spider silk" edges toward cliché but redeemed by illustrator POV. Final image avoids overwriting with "distant sounds suddenly rich."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-sculpting via sound physics feels inevitable. Risk-taking (canals as temporal fractures) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Avoids derivative "chosen one" tropes by making legacy a burden ("method was terrifyingly vague").</comment>
