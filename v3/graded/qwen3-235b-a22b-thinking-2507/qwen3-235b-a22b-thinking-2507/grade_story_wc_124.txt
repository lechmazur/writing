<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: scientific precision ("ultraviolet frequencies") clashes with raw grief ("phantom ache of tears"). Final renunciation ("broker no more lanterns") earned by the visceral memory cascade, avoiding therapy-speak. Minor deduction for slightly told backstory on the reckless trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "aching recognition of a world fully felt and utterly lost" crystallizes the irreplaceable wholeness foreclosed. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density peaks when jasmine mist reveals cobblestone rain and yeast dough, reweighting stakes through sensory accretion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: dust-filmed glass constrains light tactics, volatile Moonpetal Lilies force aromatic caution, and the Chronos Bloom's "iridescent petals" charge the final image. Sensory selection—decay of Kauri ferns versus sharp tang of cobblestone rain—mirrors emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding scent-triggered grief) tightens through deepening: perfume meeting Bloom reveals layered memories, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is palpable in "a single, hot tear traced a path through the dust on his cheek"—the physical manifestation of irreplaceable loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: jasmine mist revealing "warm yeast of rising dough" avoids abstraction. Final line ("memories weren’t stored in the nose, but in the heart") reweights the premise without moralizing, making loss resonate through sensory tapestry rather than sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Silas notices "faint, sweet decay of Kauri ferns" but ignores irrelevant details. Rhythmic control peaks during revelation—"impossible, shifting colors, revealing intricate, ghostly patterns"—compressing diction under pressure while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line charges momentum. "Pale jasmine mist... flared with impossible, shifting colors" does triple duty: advancing action, deepening theme, and embodying emotion. Figurative language ("crystal shadows like fractured memories") is sparse, potent, and never muddles peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific synthesis: "synesthetic grief" made tangible via ultraviolet-revealed cobblestone rain and soap molecules. Emotional truth anchors sci-fi elements—Elara's "warmth of her skin after baking bread" feels lived, not conceptual, avoiding generic universality.</comment>
