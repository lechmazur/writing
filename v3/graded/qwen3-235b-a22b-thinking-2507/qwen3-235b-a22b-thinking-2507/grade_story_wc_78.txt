<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacking; Elara's vow drives action but no competing fear manifests under pressure. "Salt stung her eyes" hints at strain but avoids genuine doubt or cost to her identity beyond physical exertion. Micro-choices reveal skill but not flawed hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as driftwood sings, but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. "She would never tame the sea" crystallizes stakes, yet the felt price of transformation—beyond exhaustion—isn't legible in her physical or emotional state at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet and driftwood barrier actively constrain choices: splintered planks become "impromptu keys," and the mallet's "steady thrum" charges the final image. Orchard roots as "bass notes" concretely shapes tactics during the wave breach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds—clouds dictating tempo shifts narrow options as the wave looms. But the cost ("splintered driftwood now clattered like wind chimes") feels aestheticized rather than earned; no tangible loss alters Elara's future capacity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration: "obstacles into instruments" becomes literal via driftwood shards as wind chimes. Avoids moralizing, but "stubborn hope" in para 3 edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature: "bruised cumulus," "sea sighed" reflect Elara's synesthetic lens. Compression ("fractal generating now") taught early pays off in closure, though "restless euphony" repetition risks lyric redundancy under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Fractal patterns spiraling from impact points" suffers abstract physics jargon in high-stakes beat. "Thrum" repeats 3x in final paragraph (looping), and "fireflies blinked in time" edges toward forced lyricism, dulling closure's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of synesthesia and storm survival feels inevitable: xylophone mallet transforming waves into arpeggios reconfigures "obstacle" tropes. Bold risk in Accumulative structure pays off with visceral sensory rewiring without gimmickry.</comment>
