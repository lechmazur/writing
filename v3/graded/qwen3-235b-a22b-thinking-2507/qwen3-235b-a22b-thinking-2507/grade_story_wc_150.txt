<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "purposeful wandering" versus urgency; embodied emotion in "toe struck something solid" reveals character under pressure. Final choice earned by prior observation beats. Slight abstraction in "faith" concept prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds perfectly: sensory density builds to Charged Poise closure with visible cost (Kael's tears). Orientation clear by line 3. Only deduction: "faith" concept slightly undershadowed early by physical discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard constrains choices (roots/bones navigation) and charges final image; recurring sundial object essential. Minor deduction for early "damp earth" cliché before specificity deepens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith) tightens through protagonist's agency: "purposeful wandering" method enables gnomon discovery. Cost unmistakable in Kael's silent tears. Meets 8.8+ band requirements for visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: shadow "marking time not as interruption but continuation" reweights exile. Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids all thematic anti-patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragrance both alien and familiar") and rhythmic control under pressure. Clean focalization; no head-hopping. Only microscopic deduction for "persistent ache" abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("sun climbed... casting sharp, clear shadow" propels closure). Figurative language precise and sparse. Final image crystalline without muddle. Minor deduction waived for poetic compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms diaspora trope through catacomb orchard specificity and seed-shaped gnomon. Emotional truth in patience-as-action avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off; no derivative safety.</comment>
