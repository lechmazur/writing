<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority avoids stock phrasing through concrete mapping metaphors, but the young man’s anger lacks contradictory impulses; his transformation feels underdeveloped despite strong embodied emotion in the hammer detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with the chain’s sigh-like fall and visible cost of patience, but the Orientation Test is borderline (sanctuary anchored at 78 words); lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds cleanly through moon-path rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The viaduct’s magnetic pulse after rain constrains every choice—unyoking chains requires stillness—and charges the final image; sensory details (ice’s high note, rain-slick stone) are purposefully woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s moon-path method forcing stillness, but the granary conflict ("children starve") remains abstract; cost is felt in the chain’s sigh yet lacks visceral connection to hunger’s urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "walking the moon’s path" reweights patience as strength, avoiding moralizing; final image (chain shard as "sculpted" patience) offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in lunar mapping metaphors, but "vigilant horizon mapper" title slightly strains plausibility; compression of time via moon arcs is taught early and pays off in closure’s rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with clean propulsion, but minor scaffold in "sculpted. She had carved patience..." and slight synonym churn ("cold and brittle"/"cold biting"); no loops in peak beats preserves closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of revolution tropes through magnetic stillness; "patient revolution" avoids safety-middle via tangible cost (the sighing chain), though basalt sanctuary borders on familiar archetype without deeper transformation.</comment>
