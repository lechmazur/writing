<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied emotion shines ("breath tasted of dust and regret"), micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values, but motivation ("harvest insights") stays abstract without concrete stakes—e.g., no tangible consequence if she fails again.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise is flawless: her epiphany reconfigures the silence's meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("surrender, not command"). Escalation lacks one meaningful deepening—the flute's failure feels inevitable, not earned through rising pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Micro-setting (the "avalanchingly quiet") constrains choice and charges closure: the silence isn't obstacle but "fabric" she must learn, making the canyon hush indispensable to her final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("weaving between worlds") signals early, but remains abstract; cost legibility falters until epiphany. Needed visible price (e.g., physical toll) during failure to tighten escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "true guardianship requires surrender" reweights the flute/silence without moralizing. Final image ("learn its language") offers resonant non-literal answer to "weaving" through concrete sensory shift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("canyon hush pressing down like physical weight") filters everything through guardian's anxiety, but "avalanchingly quiet" overuse risks thematic echo, slightly diluting rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but minor scaffold in "profound, almost suffocating absence of the world’s hum" (redundant descriptors) slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms portal fantasy tropes via failure-as-path: "silence as fabric" is fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes coherently without gimmickry.</comment>
