<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is underdeveloped; Aris's "brazen calm" never fractures despite terminal diagnosis, missing visceral struggle. Strength: embodied choices like wire-guiding as micro-renunciation of control. Cost feels conceptual, not lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with sparrow warming copper wire, making legacy cost legible through "raw hands, lungs tight." Weakness: tremor discovery feels coincidental, not driven by Aris's agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Copper wire functions as micro-setting charging closure (sparrow's warmth), but sensory hierarchy falters during tremor—should narrow to tactile vibration, not visual "low sound like stone sighing."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via mineral-release discoveries, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven trade-off; villagers' scoffing never pressures Aris's choices. Cost is visible ("raw hands") but not deepened by a pivotal tactical sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly through copper-vein imagery and sparrow's warmth, avoiding moralizing. Near-failure: diary entries like "Observe how stone yields" flirt with thematic echo but stay action-rooted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in botanical detail ("stress points," "sap flow"), but "brazen calm" repetition dulls rhythmic control during tremor—prose stays procedural, not compressed under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High density falters with "brazen calm" loop (4x), especially during solstice: "peace flooded him—a calm as vast as sea" risks paraphrase. Final sparrow image rescues closure propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architecture/botany symbiosis elevated by copper-wire specificity. Risk: quiet closure avoids terminal-illness clichés, but premise isn't radically new—execution transforms familiarity.</comment>
