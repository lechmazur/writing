<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in "wars raged within his ribs" versus "shyly unstoppable" persistence, but embodied emotion leans abstract ("photosynthesize pain") over visceral. Final choice to sleep earned through transformation, yet micro-choices lack tactical specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "He slept, dreaming in hues of nebulae" crystallizes the blossom armistice with felt cost of centuries of longing. Accumulative lens holds throughout, with nebulae alignment reweighting the dominant stake through patterned intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (ensconcing in "spiral heart") and charges closure ("cradling the poet’s quiet victory"). Dew-dusted starlight reprises the postcard’s glow, making environment indispensable to the final image’s emotional charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten meaningfully when the blood-orange moon reveals the "first blossom of truce," narrowing options from endless waiting to acceptance. Agency drives escalation through the poet’s persistent lullabies, but the centuries-long timeframe dilutes immediate pressure despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete transformation: "pain photosynthesized into stanzas" avoids moralizing, with the final "benediction across centuries" offering resonant non-literal answer. Reef-shadow joy reweights sorrow without false equivalence, though "blossom armistice" risks abstraction without shell imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "mind a relentless tidepool reflecting fractured starlight," with rhythm modulating from fractured ("centuries folded like origami") to fluid ("cool, dappled contentment"). Zero head-hopping; voice remains anchored in the poet’s sensory lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "jellyfish, pulsing with inner light" follows dense metaphors without pattern-teaching, triggering density penalty. Strong propulsion otherwise, but figurative muddle in the climax beat prevents 8.0+ despite crystalline final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomnia as artistic alchemy transforms tropes through "reef-shadow joy" specificity. Risk-taking in lyric escalation pays off, with "blossom armistice" feeling inevitable yet non-obvious—though shell imagery edges toward familiar magical realism without deeper world logic.</comment>
