<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "logically emotional" tension ("calculated offset" vs "felt Tower's pain"), but simultaneous conflicting impulses lack in climax beat; micro-choices (key adjustment, humming) reveal value hierarchy under cost ("sweat beaded," "slumped").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("slumped against cold glass," "azure coat stained"), sunset vanishing as live clock tightens options under Accumulative lens; persistent constraint (time/sunset) shapes every tactical choice toward earned stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively constrains tactics ("couldn't fight ice with force"), with ice groans evolving from threat to harmonized stillness that charges final image; "subsonic thrum vibrating up planks" exemplifies environment-as-setting that alters protagonist's physical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: dissonance intensifies ("groaned louder," "shards raining") while Aris adapts via vibrational matching, with cost unmistakable in "slumped against glass" exhaustion as sunset vanishes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through sonic lattice metaphor; final image ("absolution not for sins, but world's raw fragility") reweights "sonic absolution" concept without moralizing, earning resonance through concrete struggle rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("subsonic thrum vibrating up bones," "dissonance crawling up spine") modulates rhythm under pressure; syntactic compression during crisis ("Rushing up...") reflects engineer's focus without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "obsidian rod humming faintly with internal frequency" exemplifies high-density prose that advances atmosphere and stakes simultaneously; no figurative muddle in peak beats despite lyrical intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through vibrational physics ("sacred sonic lattice"), with "sonic absolution" concept reframing spiritual language scientifically; specificity of "fraction of a degree" adjustment avoids generic heroics.</comment>
