<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Micro-choice of writing "Project Silent Currents" in contract notebook reveals Aris's value hierarchy shift. Weakness: Internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; regret-to-empathy shift feels sequential, not layered under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional Charged Poise closure: locket passed under fading stars crystallizes reconfigured options (profit empire vs. honoring labor) with visible cost ("weight of his cargo empire shift"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly through maritime detail accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stars and locket charge closure (silver surface catching starlight → passing under fading stars), but "breezy" setting fails to constrain choices. Micro-setting (envelope water stains, cargo crates photo) powerfully mirrors thematic erosion yet lacks environmental pressure on tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (honoring silent labor) escalate through Aris's realization of complicity, but union objection resolves too easily ("Then we start small"). Agency-driven deepening lands, yet cost remains conceptual—no tangible loss alters tactics beyond worldview shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Mateo's medicine reroute and locket photos. Final image (compassion as cycle) reweights premise without moralizing. Near-failure: Elena's "who hears the docks' heartbeat?" risks thematic echo but saved by concrete context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices Harbor Lane address error via "cargo-trained eyes." But "cautious exuberance" recurs as stock phrase, flattening emotional texture. Dialogue subtext strong ("He'd like that" vs. broker cadence), yet register slightly uniform under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero closure-impacting loops, but "cautious exuberance" repetition creates minor scaffold. High density ("water-stained corner hinted at ocean voyages"), yet "silent contributor erased by the sea" slightly overwrites. Final line’s rhythm flawlessly charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms labor invisibility trope through maritime specificity (tide charts, survivor benefits). Fresh angle: honoring via library archives, not protests. Avoids sentimentality with union skepticism. Lacks one bold structural risk to reach 9.0+.</comment>
