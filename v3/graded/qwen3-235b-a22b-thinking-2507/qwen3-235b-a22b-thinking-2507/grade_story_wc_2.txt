<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("uncertainly certain") drives action; embodied emotion in clock-repair trauma avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation earned through tactile struggle with the compass net, though epiphany lacks deeper flaw confrontation beyond control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 3 (shop setting, character, crisis). Closure as Earned Stasis: abandoning compass embodies surrender with visible cost ("weight of satchel gone"). Accumulative lens holds via pattern recognition, though chasm crossing lacks meaningful cost escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall constrains choice (collapsed bridge forces improvisation) and charges closure (compass vibrating with falls' pulse). Ash-choked streets and greenhouse leaves evolve causally with plot, mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control vs surrender) tightens at chasm crossing, but physical risk lacks felt cost escalation. Agency-driven improvisation narrows options, yet emotional stakes remain abstract until closure; waterfall’s roar could heighten pressure earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clock fractures and compass vibration as "language" of transformation. Final image reweights uncertainty as wisdom without moralizing, though "beneath the ashes" concept leans thematic rather than altering tactics until climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured pendulum," "spectral shapes" of ash) reflects tinkerer’s precision. Rhythmic control shifts from clinical ("calipers") to lyrical ("dissolving like salt") under pressure; no head-hopping in single-POV execution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops; high density ("springs brittle as ancient parchment") with clear propulsion. Minor cadence stiffness in "he felt uncertainly certain" repetitions, but final image ("joy of the unplanned") avoids figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-tinkerer archetype with post-apocalyptic setting avoids trope. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes, though "Great Conflagration" backstory lacks distinctive detail to fully transcend familiar ruin narratives.</comment>
