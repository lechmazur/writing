<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her scientific precision versus emotional vulnerability ("splinter in her soul"), embodied through micro-choices like attaching the component to hydrophones. Yet the betrayal reflection remains slightly detached from present action, lacking a micro-choice that visibly alters her current tactic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: tears confirm the void's permanence after capturing the "ping," with conceptual cost crystallized in "less like victory." Orientation is flawless by paragraph one, and accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to the aurora's dimming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken orchard actively constrains her work—hydrophones in murky water, shipwreck metal for casting—while the ashen forge's heat/cold contrast directly charges the final image of dying embers. Micro-setting (the hearing aid component) physically embodies her quest's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through accumulative pressure: aurora flaring, filtered silence stripping noise, then the "shard of ice" ping. Her agency in calibrating the array drives escalation, with conceptual cost undeniable in realizing the sound "confirmed the permanence of the void."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—"imprinting by collecting absences"—culminating in the resonant final image where tears and cell division counterpoint the void. No moralizing; the aurora's dimming reweights the quest as both discovery and irrevocable loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: sound-focused POV ("green a low cello hum," "wind sighing through broken masts") with rhythmic control during tension ("crystalline *ping*"). Slight register drift in "splinter in her soul" barely mars otherwise consistent voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "battered marvel of salvage and desperation" exemplifies high-density textural specificity. Final image ("tears through grime," "dying embers," "cell division") crystallizes without figurative muddle, propelling closure with visceral clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms sci-fi tropes through grounded emotional stakes: "collecting absences" method feels inevitable, not gimmicky. The battered tone's modulation—from hope to hollow victory—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, making the void's permanence resonate.</comment>
