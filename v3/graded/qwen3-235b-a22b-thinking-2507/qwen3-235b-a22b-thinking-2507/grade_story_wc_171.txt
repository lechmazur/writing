<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied: exhaustion versus resolve manifests in "tremor in hands" and ritualistic composure. Micro-choices (tracing clipboard edge) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. No diagnostic labels; "words ash in her mouth" shows cost better than tells. Near-flawless but "ghosts of failed talks" slightly abstract for peak tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise where Kael's "flicker... possibility of trust" reconfigures stalemate with visible cost ("words ash in mouth"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds from terrace description through to final image. Cost proof clear in Elara's vulnerability and "debt installment" metaphor. Persistent constraint (ritual) shapes tactics but could deepen closure linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Terrace functions as active micro-setting: "cracked mosaics" and "skeletal fortifications" charge the final image where it shifts from "tomb" to "foundation." Ebony clipboard (object-as-setting) constrains choice by being held "not as shield but testament." Sensory details reflect urgency ("sun climbing... agonizing increments"). Environment irreplaceably charges closure per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Elara's admission of fault narrows options, transforming skirmishes from accusation to actionable censure. Cost legible in visceral terms ("ash in mouth") and political suicide implications. Deepening under Accumulative lens reweights "humility" as prerequisite for peace. Minor abstraction in "debt installment" slightly blurs cost focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "flawed beauty" terrace mirrors peace process, culminating in resonant final image ("foundation... bearing weight of step"). No thematic echo; "ideal worthless unless anchored in practice" dramatized through action, not statement. Final line reweights prior material as earned wisdom without moralizing. Exceptional organic emergence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "stones held heat like earth's pulse" filters setting through Elara's exhaustion. Rhythmic control under pressure with fragments ("No negotiator... admitted fault"). Compression in reflection blocks taught early via concrete cues ("remembered screams"). "Operatively gentle" slightly clinical but justified by profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "sun climbing... marked time in agonizing increments" merges setting, tension, and theme. Metaphors coherent ("fragile as midsummer moth") and payoff in final image. Final line crystalline: "imperfect, enduring, capable of bearing weight." Slight overwork in "slow pulse of earth" but pays off through reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms peace negotiator trope via specific moral calculus: redemption as "daily choosing" not absolution. "Flawed beauty" reframes war-torn landscape as active metaphor. Emotional truth in political vulnerability outweighs familiar setup. Risk-taking in quiet closure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Near-exceptional synthesis.</comment>
