<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her shift from seeking audible song to valuing silent imprints, embodied through the dust-helix revelation; avoids therapy-speak despite high-stakes emotional pivot at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "feeling its absence as a presence" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with visceral cost (tears tracing dust paths) while the generator flicker proves irreversible change in the lab's sonic ecology.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Carbide lens functions as micro-setting that charges closure—its "thick, yellowed glass" refracting frequencies constrains her discovery method and becomes the final image's light-sound spectrum, embodying the theme physically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: her questioning assumptions ("they lingered as dormant vibrations") directly propels the lens-tuning fork experiment, with the generator flicker imposing felt cost (fragile resonance) that narrows options to silent presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through dust-helix "sonic fossils" compressing shared humanity—no moralizing, but the final bell fracture avoids sentimentality by making connection tangible ("warm, intricate, and alive as a pulse") through prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "grain of wood beneath fingertips" and "warmth of shared breath" filter all observations through tactile memory; rhythmic control shifts from measured discovery to breathless climax ("dust coalesced into a visible helix").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "powerfully gentle" repetition (lens beam → focus → force) slightly dulls climax, but zero loops elsewhere; "thrums soft as down yet insistent as a heartbeat" achieves perfect textural density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes mining tech with acoustic archaeology to transform "artificial pilgrimage" into physical texture—no trope reliance, as the dust-helix reconfiguration grows organically from carbide lens mechanics and blackout physics.</comment>
