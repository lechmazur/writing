<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "serene anger" and forced panic dive; embodied cost in "stone in her gut" crystallizes the flaw. Slight abstraction in "biological trap" wording costs 0.1 but remains character-particular through ink-mapping.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with visceral cost: "time’s slowness was the mind’s cruel amplifier" reweights the premise. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—the ink’s fading patterns tighten pressure toward crystallized understanding without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved stone functions as micro-setting: porosity affects ink spread, sunlight triggers albino pain, and final image ("carving silence into the stone") charges closure. Misses 9+ gate as tool (drone) outweighs environment in final charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Silas’s agency: simulating trauma to flare ink patterns narrows options to a single, brutal realization. Cost is undeniable—"stone in her gut"—and the Accumulative lens intensifies pressure through ink’s fading dance without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme emerges through ink’s behavior and neural mapping; "cruel amplifier" avoids moralizing by being earned via the drone’s footage. Final image ("hidden scar") resonates without stating a moral, though "biological trap" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: albino sensitivity shapes sensory hierarchy ("sunlight feel like sandpaper"), and rhythm modulates under stress ("pulse hammering" vs. "glacier calving"). Minor register drift in "neural overdrive" costs 0.1 but remains plausible for scientist-protagonist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "indigo pool spread across the stone’s porous surface" doing triple duty. Near-cliché "dying heartbeat" costs 0.1 but is offset by precise "fractal echoes" in peak beats—no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time-dilation myth debunked via neural overdrive, with disappearing ink as perfect metaphor. Risk-taking in quiet CR closure pays off—"brother’s final, stretched-out breath" avoids sentimentality through brutal specificity.</comment>
