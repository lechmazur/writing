<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied details ("heart felt as frayed as the threads") and micro-choices (fitting puzzle pieces with "trembling, sap-sticky fingers") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation remains singular without nuanced internal conflict beyond despair/resolve dichotomy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise—the loom's death and Elara's dissolution reconfigure the "raveling silence" with undeniable cost ("last threads dissolved into reclaimed quiet") under Accumulative/Textural lens, though puzzle solution's convenience slightly weakens causality at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orchard and bamboo function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("bamboo whispering secrets"), but environmental pressure doesn't constrain choices; the loom's grime and failing threads offer tactile specificity without altering tactics until the puzzle intervention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Accumulative density (threads dissolving → re-emerging light) with visible cost (Elara's dissolution), but the puzzle's coincidental discovery undermines protagonist agency in escalation despite strong pressure buildup to the recommencement beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory/connection emerges implicitly through the amber bead's journey and final image ("spark across the void"), avoiding moralizing while reweighting the premise via sacrifice—no explicit statement, only resonant particulars in the dissolution moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("raveling silence," "sap-sticky fingers") and rhythmic control during climax ("The loom sang, a sound both beautiful and terrible") with purposeful compression; minor register drift in "stoically sparkling" slightly jars under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion overall but figurative muddle in "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" and repetitive "raveling silence" phrasing slightly dull closure beat; "stoically sparkling" borders on label-speak without deeper integration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of communication-as-weaving metaphor with tangible stakes ("puzzle edges fitting loom slots"); emotional specificity in sacrifice avoids cliché, though bamboo/orchard setting leans slightly archetypal without deeper transformation.</comment>
