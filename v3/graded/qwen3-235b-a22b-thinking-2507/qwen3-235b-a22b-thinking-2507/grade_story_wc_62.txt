<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in stone-carver’s tactile world ("limestone grit," "woven threads tight and sure") avoids therapy-speak; contradictory impulses (carving solitary sorrow vs. embracing ephemeral connection) manifest physically in trembling hands and ribbon-tying choices under spectral pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: monarchs form a "bowl cupping the space" where family sat, reconfiguring grief into a vessel with felt cost (tears mingling with limestone dust); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ribbon-tying density shifts that narrow Silas’s options from stone to shared remembrance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse rafters and rose cane constrain choices (tying ribbons to specific plants), charging the final image where monarchs form a vessel; "skeletal rose cane" and "shattered propagating case" reflect decay while enabling ritual, avoiding symbolic convenience through functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (solitary sorrow vs. collective grief) tighten through accumulative density—each ribbon reconfiguration narrows Silas’s emotional options, culminating in the bowl-shaped cost of tears; escalation driven by protagonist agency (tying ribbons) under Accumulative lens with visible emotional forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: Neruda’s "roots and return" on the final ribbon reweights the greenhouse as "ancient, sheltering, transformed by what it held," avoiding moralizing while offering resonant closure; no thematic echo despite "collective grief" phrasing early on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: stone-carver’s tactile focus ("fingertips dusted with limestone grit," "pressure like cool marble") modulates rhythm from meditative to urgent during ribbon-tying; ghost dialogue carries subtext ("space between the lines") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances atmosphere/character (e.g., "wings folded like tiny stained-glass windows" merges setting and theme); final line’s "true shape of home" crystallizes closure without muddle despite high lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: monarchs as living mosaic reconfigures grief tropes through stone-carver’s lens; "vessel formed by fragile, migrating things" avoids safety-middle with bold emotional specificity, though spectral mentor risks slight familiarity.</comment>
