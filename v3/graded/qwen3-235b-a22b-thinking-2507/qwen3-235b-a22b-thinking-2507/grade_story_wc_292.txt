<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (dread vs. resolve), but "nervously confident" label repeats without fresh embodiment during pivotal epiphany. Final choice to stay earns cost through ancestral stakes, though trait could deepen action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: nail transforms from death relic to "key" with visceral cost ("She wouldn't leave"). Causal lens holds through stanza-deciphering chain; cost proof crystallized in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Copper nail (micro-setting) constrains choice and charges closure: pitted cold → warm key. Sensory specificity ("spongey dread," groaning ice) mirrors internal state without cliché, tightening Arctic isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through agency: deciphering stanza → keel epiphany forecloses escape. Cost (self-exile continuation) legible in "She wouldn't leave," though jet stream timeframe lacks tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through nail's reweighting: truth as active preservation, not passive time. Final image ("key turning in the lock of history") resonates without moralizing, avoiding false equivalence on bravery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spongey dread," ink "blurred by salt") modulates under stress. Minor register drift: "nervously confident" label intrudes on voice during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "verdigris-coated copper nail" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language sparse in epiphany beat, but "nervously confident" repetition risks synonym churn near climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "reversible exile" via truth (not time) transforms shipwreck trope. Risk-taking in quiet closure where nail's reweighting carries emotional weight without confrontation.</comment>
