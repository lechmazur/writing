<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in survival vs proof pursuit; embodied grief ("hollow ache," trembling hands) avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of oxygen warnings for cataloging earns closure through micro-choices, though secondary pressure remains underdeveloped with only one character present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: ignored oxygen warnings crystallize her prioritization of proof over survival. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to the Vance Spiral revelation, with "spooled wholeness" transforming from theory to tangible truth in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sky gondola and brass telescope function as micro-setting, constraining choices (ignoring oxygen to write) and charging closure via the clouded lens. Dusty starlight evolves from observation to "ancient luminescence" gilding the journal, avoiding overt symbolism while mirroring emotional shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving cosmic memory) tightens through the lenticular cloud’s spiral revelation, forcing abandonment of survival for memorialization. Cost is visceral via oxygen warnings, though escalation relies heavily on internal deepening rather than external pressure shifts under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "Altocumulus paternalis" reweights cloud science into emotional archaeology. Final image of the Vance Spiral offers resonant non-literal answer—"love enduring" refracted through atmosphere—without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo despite the journal’s "We are never truly gone" phrase.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature in meteorological lexicon ("nimbostratus layer heavy with forgotten farewells") persists under stress. Rhythmic control shines in the spiral revelation’s cadence shift, though minor register drift occurs when "spooled wholeness" explanation edges toward abstraction mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with zero scaffold; "quietly explosive" refrain evolves meaning without loop. Final line’s "dusted in starlight, it winks back" achieves textural precision, but "spooled wholeness" explanation risks thematic echo in a high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding Q5 penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic grief trope through meteorological specificity: cloud categorization as emotional archaeology feels inevitable. Risk-taking in blending physics ("refracting time") with lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, culminating in the Vance Spiral’s earned cultural afterlife.</comment>
