<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction crystallizes in the final choice to "carry" rather than solve emotions, with embodied cost in the chest-stone sensation during transposed grief. Micro-choices like dropping the fragment amid panic reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively when Aris places the fragment back, foreclosing the mathematical quest with visible cost in the steady gas lamp flame against vanished stars. Accumulative lens holds through density increase in emotional transpositions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lead type "GRIEF IS A SILENT TIDE" writhing under the fragment’s glow constrains Aris’s choice about press contamination, charging the final image where setting becomes active resistance against emotional bleed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Aris’s agency: panic over Mrs. Vance’s sorrow infecting grocery lists tightens options until the renunciation of mathematical control carries conceptual cost in the harvest notice’s simplicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the final act of setting type—emotional currents as "unbroken" reweights the premise without moralizing. The fragment’s return to the drawer with stray 'e's resonates as earned wisdom from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in printing-specific observations ("discarded 'e's," "lead type slug") that modulate under stress—sentence fragmentation during transposed panic mirrors cognitive overload while maintaining distinct voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every line advances atmosphere or interiority ("ozone and burnt sugar" thick with "lucid turbulence"). Figurative language ("star bled out") avoids muddle even in high-pressure beats like the molars-vibrating frequency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms empathy tropes through letterpress craft specificity—halo fragment refracting into "shifting geometries" ties concept to tangible action. Emotional truth in Aris’s borrowed voices avoids generic templates through indigo-stained embodiment.</comment>
