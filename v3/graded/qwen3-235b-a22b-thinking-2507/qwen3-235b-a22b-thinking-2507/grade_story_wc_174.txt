<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (artist vs ethical purist) act simultaneously; final choice to reveal "strings" earned by tactile stick symbolism and bar-show memory. Mara’s off-page presence limits relationship crucible scoring despite strong embodied emotion ("fragile, exposed nerve").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: stick placement crystallizes stance with felt cost ("argument’s sting transformed into purpose"). Accumulative lens holds via density increase (moonlight/shadow accumulation reweighting ethical stakes), though micro-turn lacks causal escalation for 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story stick (micro-setting) charges closure: moonlit carvings transform from "accusation" to "vessel for vulnerability," constraining Elias’s final action. Radar dome’s surveillance history actively reconfigures thematic meaning, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: reflection tightens options by exposing manipulation’s inevitability, with cost legible in Mara’s absence and "shame" admission. Agency in Elias’s realization drives closure under Accumulative lens; secondary stake (artistic integrity) elegantly subsumed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</comment>Ethical storytelling theme emerges through puppet-show specifics and stick’s tactile truth-symbols, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("fragile, luminous ink") reweights premise without stated moral, though "blood on the page" risks near-abstract phrasing at 8.8 band limit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calligrapher’s perceptual signature shines ("smooth grain," "luminous ink"), but "uncommonly serene calm" slightly drifts into elevated diction during peak stress. Rhythmic control in "meteor hush" refrains compensates; no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor density issue: "thick, waiting quality of meteor hush" slightly overwrites opening tension. No loops or scaffold, but "fragile, exposed nerve" borders cliché, dulling climax impact just enough to cap Q7 below 8.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ethical storytelling via puppetry’s role-reversal mechanics avoids abstraction. Transformation test passed: generic "artist" would break specificity of calligrapher’s script margins and stick’s tactile truth. Lacks one bold risk to reach 8.8+.</comment>
