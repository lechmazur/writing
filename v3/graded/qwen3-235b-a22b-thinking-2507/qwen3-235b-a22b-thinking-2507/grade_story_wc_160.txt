<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in "trembling hands" shifting from fatigue to resolve; micro-choice using vinegar on adhesive reveals professional specificity under pressure. No therapy-speak despite high stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "hands stilled" crystallizes stance with felt cost (sacrificing council compliance for Elara's compassion). Causal lens holds from fracture discovery to decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Volcano's "breath-like expansions" actively constrain choices (thermal pulses shift stone during measurement). Final image of synced heartbeat/stones charges closure through micro-setting. Slight over-reliance on visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Aris' agency: envelope discovery → vinegar decryption → bypass activation. Cost legible in "sacrificing reputation" parallel. Monsoon threat remains slightly abstract despite volcanic urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Divert through heart" reweights theme without moralizing; final sync of heartbeat/mountain pulse offers non-literal answer to stewardship dilemma. Avoids thematic echo despite high conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Engineer POV shapes all perception: "calculating water pressure tolerances," "mineral-scented air" as diagnostic detail. Rhythmic control shifts from clinical ("tarnished links cold") to lyrical ("light and shadow") under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "acid reacted, faint ink seeped" demonstrates high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "slyly heartfelt audacity" slightly abstracts peak beat but redeemed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms engineering tropes through volcanic setting and "encrypted compassion" conceit. Risk-taking in vinegar-based decryption feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Fresh synthesis of duty/stewardship via hydrological metaphor.</comment>
