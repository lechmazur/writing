<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's "perpetually learning" trait drives micro-choices (fogged slide handling, grandmother flashback) with embodied contradiction—shivering yet patient. Final renunciation of destruction-as-meaning lacks visceral cost demonstration; "storm gifted understanding" feels conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: turbine-hum density escalates to Charged Poise closure where Mara's hands join the weave. Cost proof fails—no exact sentence shows sacrifice (e.g., "GPS still dead" implies loss but doesn't charge the final image with tangible price).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archway and turbine hum constrain choices (sheltering, slide-projection surface) and charge closure as "memory in her bones." Driftwood spiral's history ("storms weathered, alliances witnessed") makes environment indispensable—only minor deduction for generic "shattered shells" beach detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stake (artistic purpose vs. survival) tightens via Mara's internal deepening under Accumulative lens. Escalation succeeds through slide's layered projections, but cost remains abstract; storm's coincidence-resolution ("dawn bled through") undercuts felt consequence despite valid Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: kelp-mended nets, driftwood vessels. Final sculpture-as-bridge reweights "timewoven alliances" without moralizing. Near-miss—closing "reverence" risks thematic echo but avoids explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("waves clawed," "turbine-hum reverie") modulates with stress. Minor register drift: "scaffolded complexity" sounds corporate, clashing with sculptor lexicon. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early and paid in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High density with propulsion ("clutched her satchel, shielding...") but "scaffolded complexity with simplicity" is jargon that dulls peak-beat clarity. Template cadence in slide-projection sequence ("She saw... Then came...") triggers -0.4 loop penalty, disallowing 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "magic object" trope: slide reveals Mara's own hands as part of the weave. Risk-taking (lyric time-weaving) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Storm as renewal" borders cliché but saved by driftwood spiral's specific history ("decades adrift").</comment>
