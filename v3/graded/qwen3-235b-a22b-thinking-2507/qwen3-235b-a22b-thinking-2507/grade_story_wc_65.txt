<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "doubt became resolve" and model-calibration sacrifices, but "prevailing meant more than survival" edges toward thematic summary without sufficient embodied conflict escalation in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the poised quill crystallizes options with visceral cost ("flood villages or deepen freeze"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through relentless density buildup to the frozen lake's held breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Obsidian spire’s thermal conductivity actively constrains the model, while the kingfisher feather evolves from relic to humming tool, charging the final image; micro-setting integration exceeds 9+ gate requirements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation through Elias’s agency—refining probabilities under time pressure ("seven days")—narrows options to the pen’s poised stroke, with cost ("flood villages or deepen freeze") unmistakable and lens-perfect for Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "constraint could birth creativity" reweights via the vellum’s transformation from "blank and accusing" to "seed planted," avoiding moralizing with the final image’s earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tracing frost patterns," "mineral scent") and rhythmic control under pressure ("His hands didn’t shake") showcase distinct voice; non-standard "groundedly imaginative" fits cartographer lexicon without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-zero loops with high propulsion, but "symbolized the future he must write" slightly tells where showing would heighten closure proximity; minor scaffold in sleep-sacrifice line avoids penalty as non-closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Ignorance cartographer" transforms tropes through physics-bound imagination, though "sustaining transformation" risks thematic echo; specificity in geothermal modeling and kingfisher’s return avoids derivative safety.</comment>
