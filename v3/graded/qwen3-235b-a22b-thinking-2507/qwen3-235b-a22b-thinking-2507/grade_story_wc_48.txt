<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' collection-versus-witnessing tension, but his shift lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses during the climax—epiphany reads as linear realization rather than embodied struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elias' release of the younger self's hope reconfigures transience with visceral cost ("shell now whole in his mind though still broken in hand"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The seashell fragment constrains every pivotal choice, charging the final image through its evolving physicality—cold fragment to humming vessel to symbolic "whole" remnant—anchoring theme in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through cameo density (girl→fisherman→soldier) narrows Elias' options relentlessly; the soldier's dissolving hope forces agency shift with felt cost ("shell’s spiral failing to hold the shape"), deepening stakes via Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the seashell's failed capture: the final image ("carrying not shapes, but quiet certainty of having watched") reweights transience as active witness, avoiding moralizing through embodied closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("droplets clung to his coat like liquid stars") and rhythmic control under pressure—lyric compression in cameo sequences taught early and paid off in the release beat—show masterful voice modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but "swirling hush" repetition risks becoming a tic; minor scaffold in "he remembered the old lore" slightly dulls immediacy without altering tactics, preventing 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "hope collection" trope through the seashell's physical limitations; risk-taking (lyric cameo mosaic) heightens stakes coherently, with the dissolving soldier hope providing earned emotional specificity.</comment>
