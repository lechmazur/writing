<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kai's pride-turned-regret, embodied through sap-weeping bonsai cuts and trembling thread-tugging. Micro-choices like unfolding the shawl directly alter his stance, but "liminal space between regret and release" risks abstraction without deeper sensory grounding in that moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: Kai's pruning "for the words I didn't say" forecloses verbal apology with visible cost (sap tears, eased regret). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the lace's reconfigured meaning charging the final weave—no causality breaks mar the resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The antique lace shawl functions as essential micro-setting, constraining Kai's actions (thread-tugging) and charging closure through woven stitches. Volcanic rock and coral ledge aren't just backdrop—their wet textures and cerulean light directly shape his tactile choices and the apology's physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kai's agency: tugging the thread transforms passive remembrance into active seeking, narrowing options to endurance. The cost—daily tending as apology—charges the final image, but the severance's cause (pride over warning son-in-law) lacks sufficient escalation pressure in the present scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: the lace's "hidden design" reweights apology as process, not words. Final stitches offer resonant answer to "unspoken apologies" without moralizing, though "constrained beauty" bonsai lesson slightly edges toward didacticism before earning its weight in the pruning cut.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct—Kai's slow-spoken rhythm shapes sparse, concrete phrasing ("movements rhythmically placid," "voice slow as sinking stone"). Elara's off-page dialogue carries subtext through fragmented memory, but "liminal space" momentarily fractures his plausible lexicon during reflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean regret" crystallizes tone with high density. "Liquid sapphire" beam risks overwriting but pays off in the coral's "impossible color," though "diffusing a pale blue light through holes" slightly muddles the compass/shawl interaction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost ship" trope through specific, tactile integration—the compass's pulse drives action, not lore. The cerulean apology concept feels inevitable via lace patterns and coral light, but "color of unspoken apologies" premise borders on familiar until the shawl's reconfiguration makes it singular.</comment>
