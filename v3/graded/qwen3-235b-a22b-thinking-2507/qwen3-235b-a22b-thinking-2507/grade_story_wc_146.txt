<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's embodied motivation ("restore shared balance") drives action, but Tomas/Mara lack contradictory impulses; Finn's restlessness resolves too neatly without visible cost escalation during the walk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "fragile thread pulled taut" crystallizes cost of revived rhythm, but the single escalation (joining the walk) lacks meaningful pressure deepening under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Archway/cobblestones constrain choice (footsteps must match rhythm), with tuning fork charging the final image; "dust shower" shows environmental evolution causal to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (rhythm=structural integrity) are clear but pressure flattens after initial joining; cost ("fragile thread") is conceptual yet lacks visceral tightening during the procession.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (footsteps knitting stone), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "wild hush" as living pulse without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("discordant hum," vibration metaphors) modulates with pressure, though "infinitely patient" leans toward authorial tell in high-stress beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "fractured foundations and frayed souls" adjacent to similar phrasing; no closure artifacts, but "bruised twilight" edges toward cliché in opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of rhythm physics and community collapse; specific details (keystone resonance, dust release from alignment) transform ghost-town trope with emotional authenticity.</comment>
