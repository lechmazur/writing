<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is profound and embodied ("hands remembered what voice would forget"), but lacks contradictory impulses—her commitment to preserving wonder remains unwavering without internal tension. Micro-choices like tension adjustments for specific notes reveal character under pressure, yet the absence of competing desires limits the 9+ threshold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the snowfall and tightening throat crystallize the cost of muteness against the enduring "color of wonder" in the community's bones. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the iceberg’s glisten intensifying into a resonant reconfiguration where conceptual cost (silence) and hope (rainbows in marrow) reweight the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Heart Chime’s silver wires and ceramic bells constrain Elara’s final action—securing the ice fragment—and charge the closure as its "glisten dimmer but still holding memory" embodies the theme. Sensory specificity ("prismatic shards that danced on stone floor") filters through her profession, making the tool inseparable from the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara’s race against muteness: the sun dipping and snowfall tighten the timeframe, narrowing her window to make the ice "sing." The cost—her throat tightening as the symphony ends—is viscerally felt, though escalation relies more on atmospheric pressure than active protagonist choices beyond the initial placement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the iceberg’s glisten refracting "truth" into rainbows felt in the marrow, avoiding moralizing. The final image ("color home in their bones, where no silence could erase it") reweights wonder as vibration rather than sight, offering a non-literal answer to preserving awe without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV filters all perception through Elara’s bell-tuner lens ("C-sharp that signaled hope"), with rhythmic control tightening during the symphony’s emergence ("low thrum built... crystalline chime"). No head-hopping; the prose’s texture ("wind-scoured rock humming with the planet’s breath") embodies her profession’s cadence under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or stakes ("apricot and rose" cloud sea deepening the transition theme). Figurative language serves pressure ("bone through the cloud sea") without muddle, though "relic from a time when wonder had color" edges toward abstraction in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in synesthesia—translating ice memory into "symphony of truth" felt in marrow—not novelty for its own sake. The kinetic sculpture method transforms a familiar "preserve wonder" premise through specific, profession-rooted mechanics, resisting generic sentimentality.</comment>
