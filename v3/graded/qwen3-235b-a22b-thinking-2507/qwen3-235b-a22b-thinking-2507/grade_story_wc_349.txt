<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (selling erasure vs. seeking story origins) act simultaneously; final renunciation of slates earned by tactile realization with visible cost ("slates were lies"). No diagnostic label-speak during pivotal incising moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly under Accumulative/Textural lens: the quantified voids' geometry directly triggers the moonlight beam revealing nascent stories, with conceptual cost crystallized in "slates were lies." Orientation clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Glass tree trunk and bottled moonlight function as micro-setting constraining choice (measuring voids' resonance) and charging closure (beam revealing story weave). Final image of "birth of unwritten tales" inseparable from cloud-sea's muffled roar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: measuring voids' "specific geometry" narrows options from abstract seeking to precise action, with visceral cost in shattered identity ("clean slate vendor finally understanding"). Dominant stake signaled immediately.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: incising absence literally reveals story potential. Final image reweights "mindfully scattered" emptiness as generative space without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct (noticing "resonated differently around void edges"); rhythmic compression during incising ("three distinct voids...") modulates with pressure. Zero head-hopping; diction stays within vendor's lexicon ("parole," "vessel").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cloud-sea’s muffled roar resonated differently" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Closure beat ("beam that shot through...") avoids figurative muddle while recharging "bottled moonlight" with new meaning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "clean slate" trope through physicalized absence; "quantifying silence" as story genesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity in vendor's identity collapse avoids generic templates.</comment>
