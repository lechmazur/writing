<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through concrete action: "adjusting breathing" to fix the bell while knowing "drips would falter again" embodies "brittle devotion" without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (palms on fracture, pulse-matching) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. No second character, so relationship bullets irrelevant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "devotion still brittle as spider-silk, but unbroken" crystallizes the trade-off. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—drip rhythm deepening from 7s to 5s reweights cosmic stakes. Orientation solid by 50 words; cost proof in final image's "bought time, not victory" fragility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: dew-trap capillaries directly constrain tactics (measuring drips), and the ripple spreading through crystal charges closure. Final water trickle emerges from setting mechanics, not symbolism. Body/tool (bell's fracture) shapes the pivotal repair choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Aris' agency: his breath-adjustment deepens the drip rhythm under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to one fragile pulse. Cost legible in "brittle devotion" endurance. Stakes viscerally felt through "parched riverbed" and "air growing thin," though drip-shift resolution feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "cosmos tilted... back toward balance. It was enough" reweights "brittle devotion" without moralizing. Final image answers the central question through concrete particulars (water trickle, brighter stars), avoiding sentimentality via "bought time, not victory" ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: mage notices "dripping rates" and "capillary" moisture, not grand vistas. Rhythm mirrors tension—staccato "drip-drip-drip" versus lyrical "stars seemed to burn brighter." Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction ("numb fingers," "low thrum") without breaking voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm to propel scene ("One drop every seven seconds. Too slow."). Figurative language sparse but potent ("clutched like a dead child"). Final beat avoids muddle: "fracture glowed faintly... knitting together with a sigh" crystallizes closure without purple prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "mage saves world" trope through specificity: lukewarm magic repairing cosmic balance via drip-rate physics. Emotional truth in "bought time, not victory" avoids heroic clichés. Fresh inflection—cosmic resonance mended through mundane rhythm—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
