<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shows concrete contradiction (despair vs hope) via "brambled hope" metaphor and micro-choices like Kael running to the comm hub. "Strangely trustworthy" label repeats without deeper exploration of doubt, limiting 9+ eligibility despite strong embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost: water gush reweights drought desperation into collective relief. Nebula's sudden prominence at climax lacks sufficient setup under Causal lens, creating minor thematic dissonance despite otherwise tight causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating rock arches directly enable the discovery site ("under Arch Seven"), constraining choice. Watering bell's shed location isn't anchored early enough; micro-setting integration slightly delayed but pays off in final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from failed irrigation to water discovery, but cost remains abstract until the gush. Band guardrail for 8.8+ requires visible price charging final image; here relief dominates without showing prior sacrifices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "brambled hope" reweighted to "blooming," but final paragraph's "nebula made manifest" crosses into thematic echo, stating the concept rather than letting the water discovery resonate silently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("scraped frost," "breath fogging") persists under stress. Voice modulates perfectly from chill despair to urgent hope, with no head-hopping. Elision of ghost's origin taught early and pays off in earned mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion until climax where "nebula blazed directly overhead" introduces purple prose ("cool, calming light seeming to pool"). Template cadence in ghost description ("translucent form... shimmering... holding") triggers -0.4 artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating arches transforms survival tropes through geological specificity. Risk-taking with altruistic ghost works, but nebula's late thematic prominence feels derivative of "respite" naming rather than earned through prior stakes.</comment>
