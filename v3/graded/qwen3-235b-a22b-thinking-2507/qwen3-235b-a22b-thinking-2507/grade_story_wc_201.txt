<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in trauma responses versus rational math quest, but proprioception trait lacks consistent struggle—flaw feels underweighted when pain modulation succeeds too cleanly despite "genuine struggle" requirement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (temple throb, modulated pain), yet lens ambiguity persists past midpoint; "displaced rooted" crystallizes too late to fully satisfy lens-holding gate for 8.8+ eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>UV forest constrains every choice (light gradients as navigable pain vectors) and charges final image—proving micro-setting gate for 9+ with the strap's metallic cold against radiant heat reweighting mercy's cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kael's proprioceptive agency in shifting stance, but cost legibility wavers; the "predictable curve" of pain reduction lacks sufficient visceral toll to hit 8.8+ band's "unmistakable" threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through fractured light patterns reconfiguring "mercy" as navigation, not absolution—final image’s "deliberate, aching grace" avoids moralizing while charging prior math with embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in UV-as-tactile-pressure syntax, but filter-verb stacks ("remembered the sterile room... remembered through trauma responses") dull immediacy in high-pressure opening beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density stumbles in trauma-response summary ("a bird’s shriek sent him bracing..."); paraphrase loops dilute momentum where sensory specificity should dominate under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>UV penance as mathematical suffering transforms interrogation tropes, but "mathematics of mercy" concept lacks non-obvious risk—salvation-through-calculation feels familiar despite brilliant sensory execution.</comment>
