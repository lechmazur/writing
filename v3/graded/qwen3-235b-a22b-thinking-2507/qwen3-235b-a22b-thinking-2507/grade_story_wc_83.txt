<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "bleakness of loss crashed over him—yet exhilarated surged," with embodied choices like rerunning sequences to manifest grief as scientific pursuit; micro-turns lack one visceral flaw-compounding mistake under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with "tears evaporating in the geode’s warmth," crystallizing stakes via conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through density increase (static to lattices) with no causality breaks, though lens naming arrives slightly past midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting (geode) constrains choices by triggering the resonant tone and charging closure with "intangibly tangible presence"; Helios’ ochre clouds mirror internal state through action, avoiding overt symbolism while anchoring early.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via cooling period’s live clock forcing perturbation theory use, narrowing options to sensor ghost focus; escalation driven by agency earns cost ("empty ring finger"), but secondary conflict (circuit breakers) lacks interweaving depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through geode’s reprise—"not to reclaim the past, but to map reservoirs"—reweighting loss as cosmic potential without moralizing; avoids sentimentality via "bleak exhilaration" final image charging closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ochre clouds churned, indifferent" and "static between moments," with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats; minor psychic distance slippage in "unfiltered awakening" phrasing risks abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in propulsion ("fingers flew over console"), but "tangible ghost of intangibly tangible joy" risks figurative muddle; final image’s "heartbeat in the void" avoids closure artifacts with crystalline specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and theoretical physics through perturbation-as-metaphor; "unused potential pools" transforms trope via specific, verifiable detail (gravitational eddies), though drone strike premise borders derivative without deeper contextualization.</comment>
