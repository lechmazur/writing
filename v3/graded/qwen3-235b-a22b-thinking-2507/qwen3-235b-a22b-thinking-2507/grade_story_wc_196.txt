<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete actions (dust motes as "forgotten constellations," button's "chip on its edge") avoids stock grief tropes. Final choice to catalog "Proof that love persists" earns endurance through prior causality, though micro-choices during discovery lack contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes with felt cost ("fragile warmth... first since Daniel left"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns → button → letter tightens meaning. Cost proof clear in warmth spreading while acknowledging loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>File room micro-setting charges closure: dust transitions from "debris" to "map of hidden grace," constraining Elara's choice to handle relics reverently. Button's physicality ("tarnished surface now a beacon") reweights final image without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) tightens through accumulation: button's discovery deepens meaning of "small kindnesses" with conceptual cost (Marcus's erased history). Agency-driven escalation via Elara's cataloging decision, though pressure lacks one visible trade-off beyond emotional cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through button's journey: Thomas's "love persists through smallest tokens" reweights Elara's purpose without moralizing. Final image ("unfurl the next story waiting in the dust") answers central question through action, avoiding thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes swirling like forgotten constellations," "fluorescent hum a dull counterpoint") modulates under grief. Voice remains archivist-precise during high-pressure discovery, though minor filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy in early beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("tarnished surface now a beacon rather than a relic" charges both button and closure). Minor paraphrase loop in "mechanically... moved" and "sterile silence... tomb" triggers −0.2; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms foster-care trope through Civil War heirloom's specific history (54th Mass button). Emotional truth in "history erased by time and trauma" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in quiet closure earns +0.3, though premise slightly echoes archival-discovery templates.</comment>
