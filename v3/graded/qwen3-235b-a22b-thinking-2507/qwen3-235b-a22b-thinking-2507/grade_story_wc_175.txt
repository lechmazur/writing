<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action (knotting as vow), but limited contradictory impulses beyond dedication; grief/resolve lacks layered conflict despite strong embodied emotion in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: monarch carrying wing reconfigures remembrance with visible cost (tears, "blushing stillness"), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where object density reshapes meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto's cloud-void and cloud-fern stem actively constrain choices (knotting against wind), charging final image; sensory specificity ("damp earth and crushed mint") filters through Elara's esoteric realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wind gust creates meaningful deepening (method fails yet succeeds), narrowing options to passive witness; cost legible in "tears tracing silent paths" as monarch bears the signal beyond her control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars: "temporary cairn stood complete... testament to honoring itself" avoids moralizing while reweighting remembrance as active sanctuary-building against erasure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fragile orange wings the final pulse of vanishing lineage") modulates with pressure; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s resonant image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in reflective block ("She was an esoteric realist...") slightly dulls momentum; otherwise flawless propulsion with zero loops, though "profound blushing stillness" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological grief through ritualistic object-use; risk-taking in quiet climax ("living signal now") feels inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
