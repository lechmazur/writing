<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (reticence vs. action) manifests in stone-stacking under pressure; embodied motivation ("bottle safety") crystallizes through sea glass and letters. No second character limits relationship depth, but micro-choices (e.g., tracing cold panes) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with legible cost: "luminescent ache... glowing—a lighthouse of the soul" reconfigures safety through stone cairns. Accumulative lens holds via sensory density (dust motes, frayed rope), but midpoint lacks explicit pattern-teaching for anonymous letters, narrowly missing 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recurring sea glass and stone cairns constrain choices (lamp failure forces alternative signaling) and charge the final image. Micro-setting (shingle beach stones) directly shapes tactics, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (safety vs. darkness) tighten through environmental urgency (wind, tide), but escalation relies on external pressure (lamp failure) rather than protagonist agency driving the deepening. Cost ("luminescent ache") is visceral but not directly tied to Elara’s stone-stacking choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone cairns as "fragile chain of trust," avoiding moralizing. Final image ("lighthouse of the soul, steady when lamps went out") reweights safety as internal resilience without stating a moral, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant") filters details (murky green sea glass, frayed rope), but "luminescent ache" slightly overwrites emotional specificity. Rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences for wind howl) compensates for minor abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("stacking stones not as cairns for the lost, but as messages for the living"), but "luminescent ache" risks thematic echo. No loops, though "ghosts of keepers past" edges toward stock metaphor in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trope transformation via stone cairns as "language older than words" feels inevitable. Specific synthesis (sea glass as token in anonymous chain) avoids sentimentality, with risk-taking in quiet closure that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
