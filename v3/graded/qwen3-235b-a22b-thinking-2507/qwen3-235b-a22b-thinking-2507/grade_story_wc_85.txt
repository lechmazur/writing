<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied guilt ("tears tracked through grime") but backstory block slightly exceeds BRR limits, risking reflection-led mode without sufficient present micro-choices during memory recall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (clenched watch hand biting skin) under Accumulative/Textural lens; "sieved hush" density shift reweights stakes perfectly. Orientation anchored by "cobalt terrace" within 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cobalt tiles and driftwood aren't backdrop—they constrain his sifting method and charge the final image (cold tiles mirroring chest chill). Micro-setting as active constraint elevates to 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically when the watch hand transforms from hope to proof of complicity; protagonist agency drives the escalation ("thumb caught on groove") with felt cost in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars—no moralizing, just the watch hand's "bent at precise unnatural angle" reweighting the premise. Final image answers central question without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused fingers," "rhythmic scrape") and rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in backstory block ("black market genealogist" exposition) slightly disrupts voice consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-zero scaffold with high density ("tarnished watch hand—thin, silver, bent"), but "sieved hush" recurrence risks paraphrase loop in high-pressure discovery beat without full pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of genealogist-for-hire trope through specific false-memory mechanics; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, making emotional truth feel inevitable.</comment>
