<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain resolve") and embodied emotion (pen tracing, station groaning) drive the climax. Final renunciation of certainty earns closure through visible cost (empty pen, unknown outcome). Slight over-articulation in "confidently uncertain" borders on label-speak but remains action-anchored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clean cause/effect: bent nib → reactivation → edits → softening starlight. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with undeniable cost: "she didn’t know if history had changed" paired with the pen’s emptiness. Minor mechanistic vagueness in "contingent relationships" prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pen functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (must reactivate nib) and charges the final image ("empty but no longer dormant"). Sensory specificity ("soft click," "warped starlight") elevates atmosphere. Anomaly remains underutilized as active pressure beyond backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: pen reactivation narrows options to one fragile attempt. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—emptiness of the pen and unresolved outcome crystallize the stake’s weight. "Fleeting windows" tightens temporal pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme ("meaning in the threshing, not harvest") emerges through concrete action (edits, pen’s exhaustion), not declaration. Final realization reweights prior struggle without moralizing: "meaning wasn’t in the harvest but in the threshing" earns resonance via the botanist’s hesitation beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spirals that felt both alien and strangely familiar") and rhythmic control under pressure ("She wrote sparingly..."). Minor register drift in "confidently uncertain" slightly jars but remains voice-coherent. Zero POV slippage; compression taught early via anomaly mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats avoid overwriting ("ink, now flowing with condensed starlight" does triple duty). Sentence rhythm accelerates during edits ("With the pen hovering..."). One hairline slip: "confidently uncertain" risks label-speak but is redeemed by embodied action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: time-editing via gravitational pen transforms tropes through specific mechanics (quantum-entangled ink reservoir). Emotional truth in quiet resolve ("strange comfort of action amid chaos") avoids genericity. Risk-taking (open ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
