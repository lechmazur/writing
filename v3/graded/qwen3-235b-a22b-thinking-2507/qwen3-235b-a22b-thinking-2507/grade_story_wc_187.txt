<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in preemptive nostalgia vs duty; embodied emotion in "shiver ran through the stone" avoids therapy-speak; micro-choices like shadow-measuring reveal hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "preemptive ache... sharper" crystallizes the conceptual price of preservation; Accumulative lens holds as texture deepens toward the "strange peace" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt constrains choice (kneeling, palm-pressing) and charges final image; Sentinel Stones' shadow-length method shapes verification tactics; micro-setting drives the entire archival process.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: measuring shadows verifies memories under pressure; cost is legible in the sharpening "preemptive ache" that endures as work continues, reweighting options via Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions (stitching tapestry, sculpting identity); final image of quill scratching against "vast quiet sky" offers non-literal answer to memory's cost without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "crystal whispering forecourt" and "distilled starlight"; rhythmic control modulates from storm fury to "deepening hush" with zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density where "quartz veins humming with resonance" does triple duty; no figurative muddle in peak beats; "solid fog started its slow reversion" avoids purple prose while advancing time pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through specific mechanics (shadow-length dating); "preemptive nostalgia" as embodied trait rather than concept; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
