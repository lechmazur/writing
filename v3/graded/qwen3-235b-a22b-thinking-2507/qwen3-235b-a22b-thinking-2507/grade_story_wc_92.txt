<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in high-stakes moment; motivation clear but internal conflict reduced to physical tension ("heart hammered") without competing values fracturing her resolve during the critical alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("dooming them all" + physical steadiness under threat); Situational lens holds as blackout pressure forces crystallization of the revolutionary path through precise action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (alignment precision) and charges the final image (warm notches in pocket); environment actively shapes tactics by enabling the sundial's use during blackout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through situational pressure (blackout enabling cipher use), but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally demonstrated; "dooming them all" implies consequence without showing tactical alteration from loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sundial's "gaps" as metaphor for silent revolution; final image ("whisper, then blaze") reweights the premise without moralizing, though grandfather's backstory lacks active integration with the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("angles where light forgets to fall") with rhythmic control; blackout compresses diction naturally ("movements silent as falling ash") without POV leakage or register drift during tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in critical beats ("aligned its notched edge... rotated the stone arm just a fraction") but "bruised purples" edges toward overwriting without payoff in the closure unit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sundial cryptography with revolution mechanics feels inevitable; "silent revolution" trope transformed through tactile specificity of the quill holder's notches and mineral chamber ignition.</comment>
