<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("calm surface over churning current") and embodied emotion (heart thrumming understanding) drive the closure choice; micro-choices like retrieving the wing reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in the journal discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "she would no longer chase stories; she would become the tea house’s steady pulse" crystallizes stance with felt cost (abandoning obsession), under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where light/dye motifs accumulate pressure toward reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The morpho wing functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s actions (positioning it on prism) and charging the final image (blazing on windowsill); sensory details like "cerulean surface shifting from sapphire to void-black" reflect urgency while avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tracking sun trails deepens the stake (understanding magnetism) through failure (shifting angles), narrowing options until the journal’s discovery forces renunciation of her quest with visible cost in her changed greeting of patrons.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars ("Stories cling to those who offer quiet space") without moralizing; the final image of the morpho wing "holding light gently" reweights the core concept as resonant answer, avoiding thematic echo despite journal quote.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dye master’s instincts," "indigo-stained hands") filters all description; rhythmic control under pressure shown in fractured syntax during light-capture scene, with no head-hopping despite child’s late appearance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "cobalt fire" simultaneously advances plot and charges theme; figurative language ("dancing spectrum") avoids muddle in peak beats while maintaining propulsion through varied sentence rhythms.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dye mastery and heart transplant metaphors transforms "magnetism" trope; risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "iridescent caution" feeling inevitable through prior particulars like the morpho wing’s survival logic.</comment>
