<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (guilt vs duty) act simultaneously in the sanding scene; final choice to press chisel during stillness earned by inscription ritual with visible cost ("I let him fall" etched in handle). Avoids diagnostic labels through embodied details like trembling hands and microscopic carving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: "now" inscription crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost (grief as calibration). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure intensifies through ritual density (groove depths, tidal rhythm) without causal breaks. Cost legible in "incremental absolution had carved its way home."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Obsidian ridge constrains climax—bob must be shaped during tidal recession and pendulum pause. Final image charges volcanic glass with "encoded sorrow," making environment indispensable. Micro-setting (rake handle's grooves) directly dictates bob calibration, passing 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: tide’s return forces action during pendulum apex. Cost is visceral—the handle’s "microscopic letters" embody years of guilt paid in sweat and memory. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens (sanding rhythm, tidal surge) without coincidence resolving conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "carved confessions" become literal calibration tools. Final image ("wound the clock... finally at rest") reweights "incremental absolution" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding redemption in "tiny inscriptions" and chisel work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: clockmaker’s precision shapes diction ("fractions of an inch," "microscopic letters"). Rhythm modulates under stress—compressed syntax during climax ("Time stretched. The world narrowed.")—with no head-hopping. Elision (brother’s death) taught early and paid off in handle discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every phrase advances story (e.g., "volcanic glass shards that glittered like frozen midnight" establishes setting/mood/metaphor). Figurative language serves physics ("skeletal spires" mirrors clock tower), never muddling climax. Final line’s "courage to emerge from silence" recharges motif with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief measured in chisel depths transforms "incremental absolution" from abstraction to physics. Risk-taking elevates stakes—resolution hinges on pendulum pause, not emotional outburst. Transformation test passed: replacing obsidian with generic stone breaks tidal-clock rhythm parallel.</comment>
