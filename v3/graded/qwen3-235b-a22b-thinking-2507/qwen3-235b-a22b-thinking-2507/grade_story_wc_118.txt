<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but under-dramatized; "sensitively perceptive" trait lacks embodied cost or contradictory impulses. Final synthesis choice feels inevitable rather than earned through prior struggle. Strength lies in concrete tools ("filament-thin manipulator") but emotional layers remain abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("last archivist of humanity") under Accumulative lens. But escalation falters—tapestry realization occurs passively without meaningful deepening or option-narrowing. Missing required "tightening" per scope rules despite strong final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" brilliantly charges closure, and silo functions as active micro-setting (concrete absorbs echoes). Yet environment doesn’t constrain choices—Elara moves freely without resource pressure. Strong specificity ("moss" eyes, "filament-thin manipulator") but falls short of 9+ gate requiring tactical constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve stories) signaled early but pressure never coheres or tightens. No escalation: Clara’s diaries present static mystery, not rising complication. Stakes remain abstract ("weight of world’s end") without visceral cost. Agency is observation, not decision-making under pressure—violates band guardrails.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars ("walls remember what we cannot" reframed via tapestry’s vibration). Final line offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing but lacks meaningful ambiguity—no confrontation with Elara’s potential futility weakens thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sensors attuned," "bronze quiet") with rhythmic control. But syntactic monotony in middle section ("Elara probed.../focused.../turned...") dulls pressure. Under discovery stress, diction stays uniformly elevated without voice modulation—misses 9+ rhythmic calibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong textural specificity ("carbonized script," "moss" eyes) but paraphrase loops ("silence absolute"/"history whispered") and template cadence in discovery beats trigger -0.4 penalty. Final line resonant but scaffolded by redundant "keeper of echoes" repetition preceding it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival sci-fi via concrete mechanics (vibration detection, carbonized script). "Bronze quiet" is standout original image. But core premise ("displaced axis") leans on familiar apocalypse tropes without radical transformation—Derivative Premise Guardrail applies.</comment>
