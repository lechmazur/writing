<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction vividly embodied (hollow commissions vs. "value in mundane"), but epiphany risks unearnedness; micro-choice of stone-throwing ritual grounds motivation. Slight thematic echo in "noctilucent reckonings" label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (stone's cold imprint, obliterated rings) under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by line 15; lens taught early via "reading glass" metaphor and held through ripple analysis to dawn shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prism atrium and pond actively constrain choices: mist refracts light onto ripples, tide currents shape ring patterns. Final image recharges "fractured jewel" into "blazing crown" with conceptual cost, fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (hollow spectacle vs. mundane value) tighten through Elias' ritual observation; bell's intrusion forces stance crystallization. Cost is visceral (ripples destroyed) and conceptual (shift from potential to demand), driven by protagonist's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action ("he read the rings as he read glass"), not statement. Final image reweights atrium's spectacle as secondary to pond ripples, offering non-literal answer to "value in mundane" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in occupational bias ("stress fractures" in water rings); rhythm modulates from meditative to urgent with bell's note. Zero POV leakage; lyric compression taught early via "frost-locked gravel" texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops/scaffold; "concentric rings erupted, flawless circles" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor register drift with "noctilucent reckonings" (near-label) in peak beat costs 0.3, but closure image remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms epiphany trope via glazier's fracture-reading lens; prism/ripple mechanics feel inevitable. Risk-taking (textural escalation over causal turns) heightens stakes without gimmickry, but lacks one fresh inflection for 9+ band.</comment>
