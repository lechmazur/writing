<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (joy/sorrow in flute scene) earned by prior causality; embodied emotion via "tangled with sorrow" avoids therapy-speak. Minor deduction: "joy flooded" slightly tells rather than embodies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a flawless Charged Poise: "the city would forget her once more, but the harbor knew" crystallizes cost with undeniable pressure. Accumulative lens holds through density buildup to flute revelation. Hairline slip: Kael's departure slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harbor constrains choices (mapping tidal pauses) and charges final image; moonlight's "liquid pearl" directly enables chalk scores. Camera's empty chamber reweights meaning at closure. Micro-setting gate fully satisfied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: mapping → chalk scores → flute translation. Cost ("city forgets her") is unmistakable in closure image. Escalation under accumulative lens perfectly reweights silence's value with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete actions: chalked silences become flute notes. Final image reweights "joyful sorrow" without moralizing. Avoids all anti-patterns—no thematic echo, earned through harbor's tangible score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("phosphorescent waves lapped," "sea mist touch") with rhythmic control during flute scene. Zero POV leakage; syntax compresses under pressure ("Heart pounding, Elara took the flute"). No head-hopping in sign language exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; "liquid pearl" metaphor fresh without muddle. Minor deduction for "joy flooded Elara, fierce and bright" (slight tell-y phrasing in peak beat). Propulsion flawless: every sentence advances density or momentum toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "silent rebellion" trope through specific mapping mechanics. Fresh inflection: silence as musical score with chalked durations. Risk-taking (sign language as pressure source) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity anchors universality.</comment>
