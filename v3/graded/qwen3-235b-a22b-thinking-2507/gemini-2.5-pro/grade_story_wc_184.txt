<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's archivist motivation ("translate confusion into clarity") drives concrete choices under pressure, with profession-specific interiority (handling rope like brittle manuscripts). Minor deduction: emotional range narrows slightly during climax, though consistent with his methodical nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly—the transformed door becomes catalogued history with conceptual cost (integrated absence). Causal lens holds throughout; thirteenth chime timing creates irreplaceable pressure narrowing Elias's options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clock tower gears actively constrain choices (weaving rope into governor mechanism), while ceremonial rope's "braid of what-ifs" charges the final image. Micro-setting (seal etching) directly shapes the pivotal translation act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from curiosity to cosmic integration, with Elias's agency driving every turn. Conceptual cost is undeniable—the absorbed principality now bears bureaucratic weight ("fresh index card" as earned renunciation of pure mystery).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: weaving rope literalizes "turning confusion into tangible clarity." Final reading room offers resonant answer without moralizing—unfamiliar books embody the cost of integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archival voice shines via tool-focused perceptual signature ("grease-stained strut," "beeswax balm"). Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—shorter sentences during rope-weaving heighten tension without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless density: "serpent eating its own tail" simultaneously clues solution, conveys backstory, and deepens theme. One deduction for "clean, complex energy" abstraction during high-stakes approach, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms archivist trope through cosmic bureaucracy—the solution (cataloging the impossible) feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (quiet closure) heightens stakes; "fables of absence" grounds emotional truth in procedural detail.</comment>
