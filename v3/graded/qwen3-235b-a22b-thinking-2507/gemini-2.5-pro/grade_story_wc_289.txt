<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied in micro-choices: hesitation to add the nest reveals keeper vs participant conflict. "Her own hands felt empty except for the delicate spiral" shows specific, non-label emotion. Final renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost of severing her "last link."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "the thread wasn’t something to be held, but something to be woven into" crystallizes options with felt cost of lifelong isolation. Accumulative lens held through sensory density buildup to final image where "gentle, invisible tug" makes cost undeniable. No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lotus temple micro-setting constrains choice: wet stone matters for silent footsteps, rainbows on installation directly charge the final image. "Prismatic quiet" evolves with emotional state—dissipating clouds trigger the decisive shift. Environment shapes tactics via tactile details (cradling twig, weaving into latticework).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via deepening: watching others add tokens (concert ticket, baby shoe) intensifies her internal conflict about the nest. Agency-driven choice to place it forecloses isolation path with visible cost ("severing her last link"). Dominant stake signaled early but tightening lacks one additional pressure point for 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "thrush’s nest twig spiral" evolves from isolated relic to "humble loop strengthening the whole," reweighting "thread" concept without moralizing. Final image offers resonant answer: connection as shared vulnerability ("become part of one"), avoiding sentimentality through embodied cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "world spun from damp silk," "library of longing" reflect ghostwriter’s lens. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences for tension ("She walked forward"), lyrical flow for epiphany. Zero POV drift; syntax mirrors emotional shifts from frayed to "prismatic" peace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("droplets clung to lotus petals like tiny, clear jewels" does triple duty). Final line ("gentle, invisible tug") crystallizes theme without muddle. One near-miss: "deep, quiet ache" slightly generic but redeemed by later embodiment in physical choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "public art" trope via ghostwriter’s specific lens: connection as vulnerability in shared secrets. Fresh angle—rejoining through relinquishing a personal relic. Emotional truth in "archivist of affection" metaphor; avoids abstraction through thrush’s nest specificity. Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off.</comment>
