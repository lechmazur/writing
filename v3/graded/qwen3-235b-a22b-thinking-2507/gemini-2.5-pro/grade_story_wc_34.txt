<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; "driftingly alert calm" remains unchallenged despite high stakes. Motivation ("articulate unspoken needs") is told, not shown through conflicted micro-choices during encoding. Embodied emotion limited to throat-prick of failure, but no degradation under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: spectral flower dissolution + "fleeting grace note" crystallizes cost of temporary communion. Orientation clear by line 3 ("sky-courtyard," "Elian," "clouds below"). Thunder's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens, weakening causal linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mist functions as micro-setting: coalesces into spectral flower charging closure. Bolt plate’s warmth at end reweights its meaning. "Moss-kissed walls" remain postcard description without constraining choices. Ozone/blossom mist taste lacks pressure integration despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (articulating loneliness) signaled early, but thunder’s role as deadline device lacks causal integration—feels atmospheric rather than narrowing options. Pressure tightens via Elian’s drawing, yet thunder’s arrival reads as external coincidence, not protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt plate’s warmth and "fleeting grace note," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "articulate unspoken needs" as temporary grace, not solution. Overreliance on on-the-nose phrasing ("ghost in the code") slightly undercuts organic emergence, preventing higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "tasting of ozone," "harp string plucked" reflect botanist’s precision. Rhythmic control peaks during encoding ("slow, deliberate dance"). No POV drift, but "tinkersong wonder" slightly violates lexicon plausibility for Elian’s voice in closure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pencil-thin beam" to "silver patterns stark" shows high density. Minor overwriting in "tinkersong wonder" (9J) but paid off by closure. Final line’s "fleeting grace note" achieves conceptual cost without muddle. Template cadence avoided under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanist’s tools (bolt plate) with digital ghosthood avoids trope. "Graffiti art" reframing ballads feels inevitable. Middle-ground hedging in Elian’s unchallenged calm prevents risk distinction bonus; emotional specificity lacks contradictory impulses at peak pressure.</comment>
