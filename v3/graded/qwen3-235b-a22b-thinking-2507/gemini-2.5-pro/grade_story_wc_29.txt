<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "dread" vs "cautiously hopeful flicker" during activation; embodied exhaustion post-action avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: cosmic tricksters' nature remains slightly abstract, weakening motivation's grit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: campus tension softening + "exhausted ache" makes cost legible. Orientation anchored by word 15 ("night shift"). Lens (Hybrid causal/accumulative) holds through "fever had broken" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Analog radio station constrains choice (subsonic frequencies via carrier wave) and charges final image ("quiet hope humming"). Bakelite console, VU meters, and charts integrate tactilely with action. Dust/ozone sensory details avoid checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (cosmic manipulation fracturing campus) tighten via town hall collapse signal. Agency-driven escalation: counter-frequency alters campus confrontation. Cost ("exhausted ache") visible but slightly underscaled for cosmic stakes; minor lens slippage in tricksters' adaptability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Final image ("quiet hope humming into divided world") reweights "dusty bubble of analog warmth" without moralizing. Theme emerges from concrete particulars: cosmic tricksters as bored immortals vs. human fragility. No thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "spidery annotations," "gut-deep thrum." Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("lowered her sign... stopped chanting"). Elision (tricksters' origins) taught early and paid off in closure’s ambiguity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("crisp paper smelling of ink and possibility"). "Jagged edge of their hate sanded smooth" avoids cliché. Minor register drift: "neuro-acoustic level" slightly clinical but redeemed by "soothe agitated pathways" immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic horror as radio static manipulating campus politics. "Cosmic tricksters" trope transformed via academic setting and subsonic solution. Emotional specificity in exhaustion over triumph avoids safety-hedging.</comment>
