<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Mara's embodied shift from "indoctrinated fury" to "aching clarity," but the rapidity of her transformation slightly strains causality at this length; "incisively kind" edges toward abstract labeling without sufficient concrete manifestation of the trait under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with visceral cost—the buried ampoule reweights "certainty" into sediment—under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density drives the thematic reconfiguration; the "gill" revelation crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater garden actively constrains choice: the "gill" membrane redefines the mission’s target, and bioluminescent flora charges the final image (the vine’s pulse); setting isn’t backdrop but tactical pressure that reshapes Mara’s entire worldview.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency as the "structural weakness" misconception collapses into the "gill" revelation, forcing a trade-off with visible cost (burying the ampoule); escalation via Accumulative/Textural density shift narrowly avoids feeling rushed by anchoring each revelation in concrete sensory detail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ampoule’s transformation from "purifier" to poison and the garden’s redefinition from "tomb" to "cradle," culminating in the non-literal final image where a bioluminescent vine’s pulse answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crushed pearl and obsidian," "ghost-white skate") reflects Mara’s marine-biologist POV, but "incisively kind" slightly disrupts lexical plausibility; telepathic projections maintain rhythmic control yet risk over-abstracting Galen’s voice during peak tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold in closure beats, but minor paraphrase loop in paragraph one ("clouding every belief... thought echoed") and "welcome complexity" risks abstraction; propulsion remains taut despite one near-duplicate stem ("thought echoed... a presence more than a sound").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms the "underwater city" trope through the "gill" revelation, synthesizing ecological ethics with personal indoctrination; emotional specificity in Mara’s crisis ("disease she was meant to introduce") elevates beyond generic anti-colonial themes with irreplaceable marine imagery.</comment>
