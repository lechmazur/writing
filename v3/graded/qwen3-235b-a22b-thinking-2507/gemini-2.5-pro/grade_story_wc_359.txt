<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses; devotion to certifying wonder is unwavering without internal conflict or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is clear but monolithic, reducing complexity. No visible struggle beyond physical execution weakens earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "his work was done" crystallizes cost after dissolving the hush, with the reawakened world's "vibrant stillness" reconfiguring meaning. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through sensory escalation, but minor lack of tactical constraint prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ice cavern functions as essential micro-setting: bells carved from ice constrain performance (tuned to light shades), and final transformation from "sculpted hush" to "peaceful" space charges closure. Environment directly shapes tactics and the resonant final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Kael's agency: each bell strike intensifies sensory density under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to complete the song. Cost is unmistakable in "his work was done" after the draining ritual, foreclosing his solitary duty with visible exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through sensory particulars ("verdant light that tasted of new grass"), avoiding abstraction. Final image—"quiet, colorful song now filled the spaces"—resonantly answers "is wonder essential?" without moralizing, reweighting the premise through concrete transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: synesthesia frames all description ("colors were its orchestra"). Rhythm modulates perfectly from slow repose to fluid performance beats. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance remains anchored to Kael's embodied experience under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor repetition loop: "sculpted hush" appears 4x without escalation, slightly dulling momentum. Otherwise flawless density—aurora metaphors stay coherent, and final beat ("rose-gold dawn hanging") achieves crystalline propulsion. No closure-impacting artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "last guardian" trope through synesthetic mechanics (ice bells tuned to light) and wonder as multisensory necessity. Emotional truth feels fresh via concrete details like "trapped starlight" in amber sheet, avoiding abstraction while committing fully to its premise.</comment>
