<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines (grief as "focusing lens" fueling math), but "cold, dense star" borders cliché. Motivation crystallizes through "husband’s laugh as variable" micro-choice, though final "trajectory" risks thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: coordinates discovered with visible cost ("grief now had a trajectory"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory/math density buildup to resonance spike. Cost proof solid via "terrible, beautiful coordinates" crystallizing stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Geode as micro-setting constrains choices (warmth focuses grief into calculations) and charges final image (reflecting coordinates). Observatory pressure tested via breaker reset timing, though capacitor bank’s "ticking" lacks active constraint beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes tighten relentlessly under accumulative lens: coolant diagnostic and breaker reset narrow options, forcing equation refinement. Agency clear in "feeding echo of loss as tangible force," with conceptual cost (grief redirected but not resolved) legible in final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "unused potential" physics metaphor reweighted by final coordinates—no moralizing. But "resonance of a life that should have been" edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the earned resonance of the geode’s reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (scientific precision fused with grief: "perturbation theory" meeting "crushed jasmine scent"), but "intricately tangible a force as gravity" breaks syntax. Rhythmic control under pressure strong despite this artifact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero major loops, but "needle in her soul" slightly clichéd and "intricately tangible" scaffold momentarily dulls momentum. Final line’s "terrible, beautiful coordinates" achieves high density without muddle, though peak-beat near-clichés prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of perturbation theory as grief metaphor transforms revenge tropes. Risk-taking (quantum foam as "silent chord" for unborn children) heightens stakes coherently. Geode’s evolution from wedding token to scientific lens feels inevitable, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
