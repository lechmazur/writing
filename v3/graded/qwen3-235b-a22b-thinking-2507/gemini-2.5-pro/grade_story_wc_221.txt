<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction embodied via temporal distortion ("stretched like old recording"), micro-choices in sketching ritual, but epiphany edges toward label-speak ("higher state of awareness") without sufficient physical cost escalation in climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (discarding compass rose's simplicity) under Accumulative lens; "resonant silence" reconfigures stakes through visceral reweighting of silence's meaning after vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: compass rose applique constrains climax choice (discarding its meaning), while pulsar light's "syrupy waves" charges final image through sensory specificity that evolves with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via vision's knowledge deepening (crystalline time structure), altering Elara's tactics from confusion to exploration; cost legible in "quaintly simplistic" compass rose reinterpretation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reconfiguration of compass rose ("true north" as choice not direction), avoiding moralizing; final image charges prior material with conceptual cost of abandoning fixed points in chaos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("time was a tide pool") sustains under pressure, but "higher state of awareness" phrasing creates minor register drift from otherwise character-particular diction during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("turn confusion into exploration, to map the wilderness") and elevated diction in epiphany ("resonant now, filled with potential") slightly dull closure's immediacy despite strong propulsion elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation as embodied perception (not plot device) through specific ritual (sketching) and object (compass rose); avoids sci-fi clichés by rooting conceptual leap in tactile details like charcoal grit.</comment>
