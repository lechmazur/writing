<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in mentor loss drives every choice; embodied contradiction in "trembling certainty" vs analytical precision; final renunciation of old life earned through visible cost of acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (becoming guardian); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through star-pattern revelations; cost crystallized in "accept a fare" realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cracks in pavement actively constrain navigation; phantom punch reweights as responsibility tool; starlit vault's shifting patterns charge final image with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth about mentor) tightens through vault revelations; Elias's agency in interpreting star-schematics escalates pressure; cost of guardianship legible in "profound calm settling over trembling heart".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete star-patterns (plague origins, financial collapse); final image reweights "fortress" as responsibility without moralizing; "unspoken truths" concept reframed by mentor's sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in cartographic framing ("cracks as arrows"); rhythmic control modulates with tension ("air wavered... gentle tug"); zero POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "trembling certainty" repetition; otherwise high density ("sodium glow to unseasonable mist" compresses transition); closure beat ("accept a fare") crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>
