<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied micro-choices (brewing tea as percussion), but Mr. Aris remains opaque; his tear lacks contradictory impulses, leaning on symbolic shorthand rather than earned complexity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (death in daughter's hand), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density (music, oolong, vinyl) reweights the shard's meaning. Cost proof: "the key that had unlocked this final, perfect moment" crystallizes irreversible stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: the vinyl shard and oolong steam actively constrain choices (reunification tactic, sensory bridge), charging the final image where "faded notes" merge with "quiet hum" to embody the theme without abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—procuring the turntable, brewing tea—not coincidence. Cost is undeniable (death), but Lena’s resistance resolves too cleanly; the decade of pain lacks felt escalation in her shift from "clipped words" to touch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through charged particulars: the vinyl shard’s transformation from "symbol of loss" to "key" offers a non-literal answer to reconciliation’s cost, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "flawless goodbye" as bittersweet, not triumphant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness") modulates with emotional intensity, but "decisively kind" flattens Elara’s voice into thematic label rather than embodied trait, risking committee tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold loops, but "pulsing stillness" repetition (3x) near closure risks paraphrase loop (-0.3); "scent of hope" verges on thematic echo though saved by concrete oolong steam. Final line’s "radiant haven" avoids sentimentality through earned sensory charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice setting with vinyl motif avoids cliché, but "flawless goodbye" premise risks saccharine tropes. Saved by specific constraints (cloud cantilever, gravity blanket) and the shard’s irreplaceable role in reconfiguring loss as access.</comment>
