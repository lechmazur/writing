<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Kael's "reverence and audacity" remains abstract without embodied struggle during climb. Strengths: calloused hands and snowflake silence show embodied emotion, but micro-choices don't reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: Sylas's "dazed" inspection of the seed crystallizes lost control versus growth. Causal chain holds perfectly from nebula enabling climb to swap altering worldview; "stagnant certainty amended" makes cost undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nebula's green light functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax: Kael must angle the sundial to fracture its glow, charging the final image where the "wrong sky" becomes "filled with promise" through this very light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Escalation driven by Kael's agency (distraction → swap) under Causal lens, but Sylas's passivity weakens opposition. Cost is unmistakable in the "sterile room" versus "mad sky" contrast and "stagnant certainty" forfeiture, though stakes feel slightly abstract until the seed reveal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "embrace the unknown" manifests through the seed swap, not stated. Final image reweights the "wrong sky" as promise—a resonant non-literal answer to the central question with no moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("viridian nebula bled," "fractured obsidian moon") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats. Minor flaw: "cautious abandon" is told not shown during climb, slightly diluting pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional density ("shimmering twilight of the spire's interior" conveys setting/tone/POV) with no climax artifacts. One paraphrase loop ("reverence and audacity, a perfect expression of cautious abandon") in mid-scene prevents 9.0 but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms heist trope through "amend not steal" premise; emotional truth in Sylas's childlike awe feels fresh. Risk-taking in quiet closure earns distinction, though "apprentice of wonder" label slightly edges toward generality without deeper exploration.</comment>
