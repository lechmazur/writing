<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias' "not a hero... just fixing a beautiful machine" realization; embodied emotion peaks when doubt "pierced him" and the chip pales to "sickly grey," showing flaw-compounded cost without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with irrefutable cost: the chip's dimming during doubt physically manifests the conceptual price of dishonesty, while the horizon's "sliver of brilliant, honest blue" reconfigures the rust covenant's meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains every choice—its acoustics enable the tethering, and the pin's "ring like a bell" detail charges the final chord; tool-as-setting integration elevates to 9-band by making truth physically resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds as rust's psychological attack ("You are too small") deepens the internal/external conflict fusion, narrowing Elias' option to pure humility; cost legible when the chip's "light guttering" forces tangible tactical shift in his screwdriver grip.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chip's physical reaction to lies ("wilts near dishonesty"), avoiding moralizing; the final blue horizon offers non-literal answer to "reclaiming light" by reweighting rust as corruption of vibration, not mere decay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in occupational details ("filament-thin wires," "tuning screw") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from clinical ("adjusting wires") to lyrical ("wave of resonant light") without POV slippage, teaching the rust's "voice" as internalized pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "sickly grey" conveys emotional/physical cost in two words. Final line "slowly, beautifully, returning to tune" avoids sentimentality by recharging the opening "tinkersong" motif with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms repairman trope through "mending what isn't torn" philosophy; the rust covenant's conceptual framing as "lie against life" feels fresh, though philosopher's stone echoes require the chip's unique "wilts near dishonesty" trait for full originality.</comment>
