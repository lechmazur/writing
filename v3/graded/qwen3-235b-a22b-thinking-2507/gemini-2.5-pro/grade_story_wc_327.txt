<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between quiet articulation and wordless prayer; copper-veined hands trembling during climax reveal embodied conflict. Flaw: Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak pressure beat despite strong motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: the canyon's breath-held silence preceding the bone tower's resonant tone reconfigures language's survival. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density shift from chaotic echoes to singular texture-sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Towers of bone function as active constraint: the spinal-disc tower's "deep resonant texture" Kaelen couldn't decipher becomes the sound source at closure. Sensory hierarchy masterfully filters grit/chill/ridges through storyteller's tactile obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds as starling murmuration deepens texture-sound pursuit, but flock arrival edges toward coincidence rather than earned agency. Cost is unmistakable in trembling hands and the "prayer beyond words" preceding silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete texture-to-sound translation without moralizing; final image ("etched in the substance of the world") reweights language's death as dormancy. Avoids thematic echo despite "language was not dead" statement's proximity to preachiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "felt the world more than saw it" establishes textured POV; rhythmic control peaks with "river of black ink" simile. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly from observation to wordless prayer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "plucked string the size of a mountain" delivers high-density resonance without muddle. "Copper veins" and "bone towers" avoid stock metaphors through consistent tactile lexicon. Final line's cadence shift crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistic anthropology and materiality; "translating texture into sound" transforms cliché. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry—echoes as dying language manifests physically in canyon's roar.</comment>
