<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied micro-choices (closing eyes to "read" screw), but "motivation was no longer to soothe with lavender" risks slight tell-don't-show. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. purpose) crystallize perfectly in the screw examination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: "felt not what was missing, but the extraordinary weight of what remained." Accumulative lens holds through sensory accumulation; fog-to-sun shift charges the final image without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Water clocks function as micro-setting that constrains choice (tactile reading method) and charges closure. Final shafts of light on "dusty floor" reweights the opening fog, but setting doesn't actively block options during peak tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens: each screw detail ("tension," "release," "fear and hope") deepens the dominant stake (finding meaning post-illness). Protagonist agency in closing her eyes drives the revelation; cost is the visceral shift in her final breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: screw's "wear patterns into feeling" becomes the resonant answer. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "scentless void" into "extraordinary weight" without stating the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("map emotional terrain from posture of a shoulder"), but "fragile peace she cultivated" slightly overwrites. Rhythmic control under pressure in "Fear and hope, twisted together" modulates voice organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "liquid heartbeats" and "trembling calm" achieve high density without muddle. One borderline repetition ("tremor in her hands"/"familiar tremor") avoids penalty through intentional rhythm. Closure beat immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis: anosmia as gateway to tactile empathy transforms midwifery trope. Specificity of "birthing clamp screw" avoids quirkiness, though "humanize this" phrasing slightly diminishes risk. Freshness in redefining "miracles" through mechanics.</comment>
