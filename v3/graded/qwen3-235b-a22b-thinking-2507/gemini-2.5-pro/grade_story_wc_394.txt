<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes in 'Grip' realization; embodied tension in sweat/oil vs. 'sacrilegious joy' laugh. Single-POV constraint fully leveraged with micro-choices (kicking lever, pulling actuator) revealing hierarchy of values. No diagnostic label-speak under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: suspension above acid sea reconfigures 'Yearning Algorithm' stakes through visible isolation ('he couldn't tell a soul'). Causal lens holds—glyph understanding directly enables wing modification and grip actuation without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Acid sea functions as micro-setting constraint—launch platform corrosion and 'hungry' hiss pressure tactics. Whalebone struts and pivoting fins charge final image; sensory details ('green acidic vapors') filtered through Kaelen's urgency avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving Yearning Algorithm) tightens through glyph realization to flight test. Agency-driven escalation: 'Grip' command forces wing redesign altering tactics. Cost legible in isolation and physical risk—'fuming acid' proximity reweights victory as bittersweet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through 'bell no one hears' motif: final suspension reweights yearning as solitary triumph. Avoids moralizing—'sacrilegious joy' crystallizes complexity without false equivalence. Conceptual cost (proof without audience) resonates through image, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature evident in 'kaleidoscope' metaphors and gear-focused diction ('chronometers', 'non-Euclidean'). Rhythmic control peaks in launch sequence—short clauses ('Wind howled. Acid sea rushed.') mirror stress without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; 'shimmering patterns bloomed and collapsed' exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ('peal was most beautiful thing') avoids figurative muddle while charging closure. No register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms 'yearning' trope via concrete physics (gripping air folds) and emotional specificity ('sacrilegious joy'). Risk-taking (non-Euclidean wings) heightens stakes coherently—closure image feels inevitable yet fresh.</comment>
