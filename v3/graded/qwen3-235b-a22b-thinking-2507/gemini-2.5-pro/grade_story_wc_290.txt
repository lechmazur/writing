<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Claustrophobia and "prudently adventurous" traits drive concrete choices under pressure, but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses in peak moments; journals reference feels slightly expository rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with vanished chest pressure as felt cost; causal chain holds tightly from organ playing to keystone strike, though organ's "rage" motivation lacks seamless escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shifting walls actively constrain choices ("doorway gone, replaced by solid wall"), and compass point functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; starlight/shadow motif lacks final reweighting for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from claustrophobic panic to sanity-fraying spatial mutiny, with "spatial warping" directly narrowing Elias' options; one tightening (organ provoking chaos) sufficiently forecloses escape paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "quiet victory in war against forgetting," with blueprints-as-key offering resonant conceptual repricing; avoids moralizing while charging the final image with legacy's weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "skeletal ruin clawing at starlight," but minor POV drift in "profound spatial mutiny was at work" slightly breaches Elias' lexicon; rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "velvet of dust" exemplifies textural specificity, though "mournful sound groaned" risks cliché in high-pressure beat; propulsion remains relentless toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms spatial horror tropes through architect's blueprints-as-weapon synthesis; "compass point as tuning fork" is fresh inflection growing from established details, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
