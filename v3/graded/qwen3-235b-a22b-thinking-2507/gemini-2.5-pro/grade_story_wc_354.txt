<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: chess logic vs exile's harshness. Final stone-release choice earns renunciation with visible cost ("dent no longer a scar"). Minor tell in "hopeful melancholy" slightly dilutes embodiment but closure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: emerald lights crystallize options with undeniable cost (stone drop + emotional shift). Accumulative lens holds—density increase in silence patterns tightens stakes. Zero causality breaks; cost proof clear in "sadness harmonized with joy".</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the worry stone's dent constrains choice (tactile memory during observation) and charges closure (releasing it as rebirth). Sensory details purposeful—"fillings ache" grounds alien physics. Environment actively shapes tactics via sensory deprivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: "discover beauty" motivation intensifies as silence-charting reveals covenant's truth. Visible cost in transformed stone meaning reweights exile. Band guardrail met—price charges final image without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "symphony in unheard register" answers central question without moralizing. Final image ("scholar at edge of universe") resonates as non-literal payoff. Avoids thematic echo—beauty/discovery earned via luminous display, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: chess metaphors filter all observation ("silence was a pawn's advance"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—compressed diction for tension, lyrical flow at climax. Zero head-hopping; elision taught via worry stone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density with propulsion: "mournful and sublime" does double duty. No figurative muddle—metaphors serve logic ("symphony playing in unheard register"). Final line recharges "cosmos to learn" with earned specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: chess logic applied to magnetic fields transforms exile trope. Specific details (fillings aching, basalt dent) avoid abstraction. Bold risk—making silence the protagonist's tool—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
