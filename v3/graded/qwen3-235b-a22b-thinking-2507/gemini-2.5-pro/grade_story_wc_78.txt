<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (anxiety/anticipation) manifest in embodied micro-choices (charcoal mapping, mallet timing) under storm pressure; final endurance earns cost via physical toll ("breathing heavily") without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: Kai's exhaustion ("breathing heavily") crystallizes the transformed storm's legacy, reconfiguring the "obstacle into instrument" premise under Accumulative lens with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet and fractal-drawn cedar log constrain every tactical choice (mapping, striking) and charge the final image ("mallet hanging like a pendulum"), with sensory details (salt/apple blossoms, thrumming wood) evolving causally through the squall.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm pressure escalates via Kai's agency (drawing, striking) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to rhythmic adaptation; cost legibility suffers slightly as emotional/physical toll remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized during peak action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: "turning obstacles into instruments" reweights from abstract philosophy to embodied practice in the final image (orchard "humming with memory"), avoiding moralizing while embracing complexity ("terrifying forces held a note of beauty").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fractal generating patterns," "cello-like moan") modulates with storm intensity; rhythmic control during action beats ("struck... struck again") teaches patterned elision early, paid off in closure's resonant quiet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Minor overwriting in calm moments ("restless euphony of survival") slightly dulls momentum, but storm sequence achieves high density ("wave crashed... struck... struck again") with zero loops and precise verbs driving propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia and survival ritual avoids trope clichés; risk-taking (fractal storm-conducting) heightens stakes coherently, though "Razor Squall" terminology leans slightly toward familiar genre shorthand without full transformation.</comment>
