<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (flee/stay, speak/silence) drive final choice; embodied cost in nerve "tingle" as "low-voltage accusation" avoids therapy-speak. Micro-choice placing bolt earns closure with visible vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: bolt beside teacup reconfigures options. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; staircase discoloration anchors orientation early. Final image makes conceptual cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress and snow constrain choices (escape path), but staircase discoloration—though pivotal—lacks active pressure on final bolt placement. Micro-setting (bolt) charges closure, but environment’s causal role stays implied rather than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs truth) tightens through Elias’ agency: choosing to remain forecloses escape, then placing bolt forces reckoning. Cost is unmistakable—"stark question mark" against linen—under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through bolt/staircase/snow particulars; final "frostbitten hope" reweights "safety" without moralizing. "Something fragile had begun to thaw" offers resonant non-literal answer to cost-of-safety question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("seraphically mundane," nerves as "low-voltage accusation"), but "stark question mark" edges toward abstract phrasing in peak beat. Rhythmic control under pressure remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "phantom tingle... low-voltage accusation" compresses interiority. Minor register drift in "stark question mark" and slight synonym churn ("sterile safety, a bulwark") prevent 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms guilt trope via nerve regeneration as embodied cost and "seraphically mundane" labor. Fresh inflection in bolt-as-question-mark closure, though snow/thaw motif borders familiar. Avoids safety middle through moral ambiguity.</comment>
