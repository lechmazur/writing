<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("duty vs belief") crystallizes in hesitation beat; embodied cost in "warmth like transfusion of yearning" avoids label-speak; micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "fear that built this place screamed" vs "warmth screamed louder" makes stakes legible; accumulative lens holds through resonant hush intensification to harmonic chord.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Crystal pillar gap constrains the climax action; "micro-setting" pearl charges final image; sensory hierarchy (hum in marrow, microscopic etchings) reflects urgency while avoiding checklist.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>One deepening—hesitation heartbeat where life flashes—narrows options to irreversible choice; cost legible in "crushing loneliness of his vigil" vs "foolish dream" without soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("broadcasting rescued hopes") reweights isolation theme through concrete action, not abstraction; avoids moralizing by making connection tangible via light/sound physics in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("silence wasn't empty; resonant hush") modulates under stress; rhythm shifts from lyrical to staccato during hesitation; no POV leakage despite high interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "light thick as honey" achieves triple density (sensory/metaphor/pace); climax prose avoids muddle with crystalline clarity ("walls between crystals seemed to disappear").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker trope via emotional accumulator; risk-taking in climax (sensory explosion over physical action) heightens stakes without gimmickry; specificity ("cultivated pearl," "fossilized conch") avoids template.</comment>
