<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blindness as constraint drives tactile method, but interior contradiction lacks depth; calm under pressure reads as competence without struggle, missing contradictory impulses in peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "sank onto her stool" shows cost of endurance, with horn blasts tightening options causally; lens (Causal) holds through anchor-lift deadline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Water basins function as micro-setting that charges final image (still water = success), constraining choice via vibration; mist depot pressure alters tactics through fog-reliant drone function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time pressure escalates via horn blasts (narrowing options), but cost remains physical/emotional without deeper trade-off; agency in repair forecloses failure path with visible exhaustion cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "decode feedback into direction" motif, but explicit phrasing risks thematic echo; final image reweights chaos-to-clarity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tactile over visual) modulates under stress; "magnetic calm" phrasing slightly abstract, but rhythmic control in repair sequence elevates tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("fractured things back to wholeness"/"decode feedback") and abstract calm description; no closure-dulling artifacts, but density dips in backstory fragment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repair-as-translation via water basins; transforms "blind artisan" trope through specific method, though emotional complexity slightly generic in high-stakes context.</comment>
