<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interiority shows "logical dreamer" trait through concrete actions like equation design, but lacks contradictory impulses during crisis (e.g., no tension between hope/pragmatism when needle dips). Embodiment limited to "breath caught" without deeper physiological contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis: gauge settles higher with "equation spent" shells showing visible cost, under Accumulative lens where tide-submergence intensifies pattern density. Cost proof clear in "scattered and inert" decorations foreclosing the method's reuse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Tide-polished grotto constrains every choice: tidal breath activates the pattern, salt film enables phosphorescence, and returning water serves as essential catalyst. Final image charged by "quiet satisfaction" echoing earlier "serene upheaval" with spent shells.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when needle dips toward zero—a deepening that reweights vitality measurement from abstract to visceral. Cost legible in "equation spent" shells, but lack of tactical shift during crisis slightly softens agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "hope as puzzle" motif; final image of Elara calculating next variables reweights "logical dreamer" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing resilience through shell patterns, not stating "hope matters."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "lucidly watchful" filters all description (e.g., noticing "interdimensional hum"). Rhythmic control under pressure via short sentences ("It was working") amid complex syntax, with elision taught through tidal progression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "slow, inexorable return" varies rhythm without loops. Minor density issue: "delicate, quantum nudges" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat, but payoff in pattern dissolution justifies phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "hope" trope through measurable equations and tide-activated patterns. Risk-taking with quiet climax pays off: gauge stabilization feels earned, not gimmicky, with specificity in "sun-bleached whelk" avoiding abstraction.</comment>
