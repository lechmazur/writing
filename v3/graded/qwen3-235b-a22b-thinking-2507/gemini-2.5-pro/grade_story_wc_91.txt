<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in concrete action (releasing fireflies as "philanthropist of moments"), but "texture of transformation" risks thematic abstraction; final kneeling choice earns closure through embodied cost ("empty bottles and lingering warmth").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: relinquishing fireflies forecloses his quest path with tangible cost ("empty bottles"), fulfilling Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration; prophecy complication doesn't resolve causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Volcanic sand and fireflies constrain choices (detour to alcove) and charge closure (kneeling on "lingering warmth"); "glassy obsidian grains" and tidal pool glyphs exemplify purpose-driven specificity that reweights transformation at end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through celestial alignment intensifying pressure on Kael's quest; cost (sacrificing fireflies) visibly alters tactics, but prophecy coincidence slightly dilutes protagonist agency in resolution despite firefly release being causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through firefly release reweighting "texture of transformation" without moralizing; final line crystallizes non-literal answer via physical sensation, though "whispered suggestion" skirts thematic echo in closure beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("salt-stung clothes," "vibrant hush") modulates with cosmic pressure; rhythmic control in climax ("plume of steam rose... glowing with soft, verdant luminescence") avoids lyric overwriting while teaching compression pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion ("hiss of waves... low thrum of molten heart" advancing atmosphere), but "sonorous sigh shuddered" creates mild metaphor dissonance; zero loops though minor register drift in "resonant frequency" during high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms prophecy trope through accidental fulfillment via firefly release; "vibrant hush" redefines silence as active pressure, avoiding abstraction with volcanic heartbeat motif that charges closure without gimmickry.</comment>
