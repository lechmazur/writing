<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Motivation ("discover shape of collective grief") drives every tactile choice; embodied emotion avoids therapy-speak ("weight of each new name as silence"). Contradictory impulses crystallize when grandmother’s spectral presence guides chisel to nexus point, foreclosing monument-as-grief with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: abstract web reconfigures grief as network with undeniable conceptual cost ("pressure eased... profound peace"). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation (ribbon/butterfly/orchid parallels), but migration timeframe lacks causal pressure on tactics during storm climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (woven ribbon roll) constrains choice: its textures force Elias to map sorrow through touch, charging final image as "interconnected threads." Greenhouse decay ("skeletal fingers" vines) mirrors internal state without cliché, directly enabling the web-carving revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding collective grief) tightens meaningfully during storm’s arrival, narrowing focus to the nexus point. Cost is legible ("thundering quieted"), but butterfly migration timeframe functions as atmospheric motif rather than live clock altering tactics under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: ribbon threads → butterfly paths → orchid veins → slate web. Final line ("tracing the beautiful, heartbreaking shape") reweights premise without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through stone-carver’s labor-focused resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: gravestone-carver notices textures (slate smoothness, fabric weaves), filters world through "silence" of names. Rhythm modulates perfectly—lyrical during reflection, staccato during storm—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "orange wings like flickering embers" exemplifies textural specificity. "Thundering calm" risks purple prose but pays off via storm’s "thundering in his soul," demonstrating patterned escalation. Final line’s "beautiful, heartbreaking shape" avoids sentimentality through concrete verb "tracing."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via stone-carver’s tactile epiphany: collective sorrow as abstract web (not monument) feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heightens emotional truth without gimmickry, anchored by ribbon roll’s physicality.</comment>
