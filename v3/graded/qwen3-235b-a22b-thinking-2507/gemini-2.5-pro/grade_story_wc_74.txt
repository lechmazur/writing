<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (hope/doubt) manifest physically in the ledge scene; umbrella backstory concretely motivates the 'witness' symbol. "Stubborn fire" slightly label-y but redeemed by embodied cost during the silent wait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the city's scattered lights reconfigure "dormant language" into active communion. Orientation perfect by line 5; Accumulative lens (symbol density) held relentlessly to the final "nascent stars" image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse constrains every choice—only vantage for city-wide display—and the moon-tipped brush's luminosity directly charges the final golden symbols. Micro-setting functions as environmental pressure, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Elias' agency: rigging spotlights forecloses retreat, making silence's "familiar ache of doubt" a visceral cost. Stakes crystallize through one tightening (display → response) under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through symbol evolution, not statement; the final "crude, shaky imitation" of 'witness' reweights the umbrella memory as non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in action, not reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "shades of ochre pooled in pre-dawn smog"—Elias' painterly focus shapes every observation. Rhythm tightens under pressure ("He stood back, his work done") without voice slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "transcribing a feeling" compresses theme into action. Figurative language ("luminescence of their own") intensifies without muddying the climax. Final line crystallizes closure with "nascent stars" resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "lost language" trope through concrete stakes: abstract symbols as proof of communal memory. Specificity of snow hare brush and saffron strokes avoids quirkiness, making emotional truth inevitable.</comment>
