<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "quiet rebellion" vs. duty; embodied emotion in "suit’s heaters groan" and "beautiful ache" avoids labels. Final endurance earns closure with visible cost: documenting extinction sears memory deeper than film.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density tightens as dawn approaches. Charged Poise closure lands via "memory far more vivid than film" with undeniable conceptual cost—the irreversible loss of the Silene Flora. Orientation clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moonlit summit constrains every choice: frozen ground dictates plate placement, vacuum shapes sound ("thump-clack"), and radiation sensitivity forces the timed bloom. Final image’s "sterile, unforgiving light" charges the closure by contrasting the vanished blue/violet garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the bloom before extinction) tightens via the "dawning hush" as Kepler-186 grazes the horizon. Protagonist’s endurance forecloses the path of delay; cost is visceral in the sublimation moment where "delicate structures vanish," altering his purpose from witness to keeper of memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Theme of transience emerges through the Silene Flora’s cycle and Hasselblad’s "soul" vs. digital data. Final image reweights legacy without moralizing: the "beautiful ache" seared behind his eyes proves memory transcends the photograph, answering "last of something precious" through loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV voice is distinct: "crunch of regolith," "helmet vacuum thump-clack" reflect Kaelen’s sensory focus. Rhythm modulates from slow anticipation ("waited") to urgent bloom sequence. Minor slip: "profound, dawnlit melancholy" tells where embodiment could deepen.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High density with propulsion—"sublimated directly into the thin atmosphere" shows precision. One paraphrase loop: "silent, ghostly garden" and later "silent, blooming lights" slightly dilute impact. No closure artifacts; final line’s "lonely, moonlit summit" crystallizes loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms extinction trope via crystalline organisms and chemical "callnote." Emotional specificity in honoring legacy through photography, not rescue. The spore-catalyst method feels inevitable, synthesizing sci-fi with human ritual for fresh inevitability.</comment>
