<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara’s "logically emotional" trait manifests in embodied contradiction: filing away "cold knot of dread" while body screams during vibrational matching. Final endurance ("hollow relief of battle won") earns stasis with visceral cost—sweat-soaked trembling in sub-zero air.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal escalation holds: invasive hum → adaptation choice → near-catastrophic lock → subsumption. Charged Poise closure lands via silence reconfiguring stakes; cost is legible in "slumped against the console, sweat-soaked and trembling despite sub-zero temperature."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina actively pressures choices: shifting floes generate the "symphony" she conducts, while the hum’s origin in ice forces adaptation. Final image ("drift-ice marina was quiet again") charges closure by showing environment restored through her action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from hum’s intensification to tower-shuddering dissonance, narrowing options to vibrational mirroring. Cost is unmistakable in physical toll and "hollow relief"—agency reweights protection as integration, not destruction, with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "sonic absolution" crystallizes in subsumption ("not destruction... but cleansing"). Final image reweights premise via quiet marina guarded by engineer—no moralizing, just resonant "ancient song she protected" answering the central conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: notices ice’s "deep, resonant song," breath as "fleeting ghost." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("Then, with a final, willed push..."). "Fleshly ethereal" tone stays coherent through "singing of blood cells" to steady thrum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("groaning floes," "vibrated with dormant energy"). Figurative language serves pressure: "discordant hum like grinding teeth" intensifies threat without muddle. Final line recharges opening’s "azure coat" with earned weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope through sonic physics: "Siren’s Heart" as captured sound/light lattice demands vibrational matching. "Logically emotional" isn’t label but method—body screams while mind holds waveforms—yielding inevitable, fresh synthesis in quiet closure.</comment>
