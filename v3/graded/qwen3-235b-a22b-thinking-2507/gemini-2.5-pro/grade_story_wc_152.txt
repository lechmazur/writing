<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "harmless eccentric" disguise vs sharp mind, but lacks inevitable flaw-driven mistake; micro-choices (altering star positions) reveal values with visible cost, yet competence borders on flawless under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (safety compromised), but cost proof weakens impact; "wait, and stitch, and listen" lacks tangible on-page price for risking life, undermining escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid cobalt observatory atmosphere, yet setting fails to constrain choices; eternal candle charges final image but remains passive—micro-setting opportunity missed as embroidery tools don't shape transmission tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through intuitive pattern-weaving ("discordant notes" to "terrifying image"), but cost legibility falters; "window closing" feels abstract without physical/emotional toll like trembling hands or sacrificed item.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unheard stories" motif earns resonance through concrete action (embroidery as map), with final silence recharging theme non-literally; avoids moralizing but could deepen conceptual cost beyond implied danger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("spidery fingers," "ghost-stitch") and rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early ("silent symphony") pays off in closure without scaffold or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or artifacts; "foolish eccentric kept on for tradition’s sake" compresses backstory efficiently. Final line cadence ("wait, and stitch, and listen") delivers propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of embroiderer/spy trope with cosmic stakes; "Serpent’s Coil" as coded map transforms cliché through specific craft logic, though risk-taking stops short of full conceptual extremity.</comment>
