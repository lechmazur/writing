<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (wanting truth vs fearing it) is embodied in "fortress walls trembling" during the branch push, but "warlike serenity" leans slightly abstract early on; micro-choices like resisting memory ghosts show value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the confession reconfigures meaning ("truth mirrors never showed") with visible cost ("guard around her heart begin to unbend"), all under airtight Causal lens (ritual → push → truth release).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The vortex actively constrains choices (psychic resistance during circles) and charges the final image—the mud where the seed is planted is the branch's root site, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation is pure protagonist agency: each circle tightens options, culminating in the unbending push that forecloses ignorance with felt cost (emotional walls cracking), perfectly aligned with Causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges non-literally through the confession’s devastating simplicity ("I wasn't strong enough"), reweighting "mirrors don’t show" without moralizing; final image of weeping for truth, not loss, resonates as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: "blanched reeds," "ravenous life against stagnant death" filter everything through druidic specificity; syntax compresses under stress ("The branch resisted, groaning...") without losing voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in peak beats ("a fissure of light split the vortex") with visceral propulsion. Only "soul-deep resonance" borders on abstraction but is grounded by "truth colder than imagined."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specific emotional truth—the confession’s inadequacy (not betrayal) is non-obvious yet inevitable; "flesh-eating seed" as druidic humor backstory avoids gimmickry, heightening stakes coherently.</comment>
