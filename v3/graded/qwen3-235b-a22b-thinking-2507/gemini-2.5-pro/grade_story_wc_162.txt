<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete actions (grain tracing), but "featherly determined" lacks embodied contradiction; final choice earned yet cost remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("chosen terms of distance"), but cost proof falters—permanent separation is stated yet not viscerally felt in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wood grain functions as micro-setting that constrains navigation and charges the ending; the chair's final analysis reweights prior material through tactile specificity without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through logbook decoding, but escalation leans on forecasted threshold rather than protagonist agency; conceptual cost (necessary distance) lacks tangible on-page forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" integrates through Elian's chair analysis, offering non-literal resolution where the empty chair reweights the threshold's sacredness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("light breaking against crystal") sustains under pressure, though "featherly determined" briefly drifts into abstract label-speak during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No loops in climax, but "vibration of a fundamental rule" slightly muddles physicality; final line avoids sentimentality through concrete chair imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesizes weather code with reality fractures organically; risk-taking (logbook as map) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "butterfly effect" phrasing edges near trope.</comment>
