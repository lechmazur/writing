<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("to become visible to those who need you") manifests in Elias’s final action—unseen but found—with embodied cost in Anya’s choked gasp. Anya’s brief on-page presence lacks secondary pressure development, capping near-9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: Anya’s hope "washing away despair" and Elias’s "quiet click of satisfaction" crystallize options under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation clear by line 3; lens taught early via sensory accumulation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flickering library lights actively constrain Elias’s timing and charge the final image ("sapphire hush" reweighted by Anya’s hope). Micro-setting (tape fragment’s brittle edges) directly alters tactics during placement, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving erased lineage) tighten through Elias’s agency: tape retrieval under grid failure forces precise timing. Cost is visceral in Anya’s "choked gasp" and Elias’s fulfilled purpose, reweighting the dominant stake via Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of invisible connection emerges through particulars—Elias’s "phantom hand" mending lives—not moralizing. Final image ("he had been found") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "how do we matter?" without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust itself had long since accepted" his silence) modulates with pressure; rhythmic control intensifies during tape placement ("strobing his movements"). Minor register drift in "quiet shout into the void" prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-zero loops; high density ("a sapphire hush, a quiet made deeper") fuels propulsion. Slight redundancy in "desperate, frantic energy" (Q7 anti-pattern) prevents 9.0, but closure beat ("clutched the tape to her chest") remains unblemished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "hidden hero" trope via specific sense-memory mechanic and archival urgency. Emotional truth in Elias’s quiet satisfaction avoids sentimentality, but "sapphire hush" risks poetic convenience without stronger prior grounding.</comment>
