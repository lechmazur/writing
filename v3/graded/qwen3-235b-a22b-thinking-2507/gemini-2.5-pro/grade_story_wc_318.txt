<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("restore lost laughter") intensifies through concrete action, but wife's abrupt shift from fear to curiosity lacks embodied contradiction; "method of communication made manifest" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty in peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (tear, fragile smile), but excessive backstory reflection exceeds BRR limits and ghost-physics causality gap (-0.8 non-closure accumulation) undermines high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Echo chamber tunnel" micro-setting actively constrains choice (sound amplification for communication) and charges final image; leaf blower functions as environment-constrained tool per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency (pull cord attempts) under Accumulative lens reweights grief stake; cost unmistakable in wife's tear, though ghost's machinery operation lacks physical grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (macerated leaves as grief symbols), with final image ("seed of healing") offering non-literal answer to "tending unspoken" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes danced in slivers of light") modulates with pressure, but stock ghost imagery ("spectral fingers") and near-cadence repetition in climax dent rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with clear propulsion, but "mournfully eager" repetition and synonym churn ("violent airstream"/"gale-force wind") trigger -0.3 loop penalty; no closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of haunting trope via leaf blower communication, though "final grain of sand" cliché and middle-ground hedging on grief specificity limit risk distinction.</comment>
