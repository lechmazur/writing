<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias’s embodied grief avoids therapy-speak; his "careful, curated blank" face and whittling-as-rebellion show contradictory impulses (survival vs. guilt) that earn the final renunciation. Only slight deduction: Mara’s arrest backstory leans tell over show, but compression fits scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the wooden bird in dead flowers crystallizes cost (Mara’s absence) with visible emotional trade-off. Minor flaw: the "morally ambiguous" reflection risks over-explanation, slightly dulling the final image’s autonomy under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The turbines’ "whump-whump" vibration actively pressures Elias’s ritual, and the dried bouquet evolves from static relic to closure-charging vessel. Near-miss for 9.0: setting constrains emotion but could more directly alter tactics (e.g., turbine noise disrupting focus).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (cultivating lightness under oppression) deepen through ritual escalation, with Mara’s off-page arrest providing felt cost. Deduction: cost is retrospective, not viscerally paid on-page during the ritual’s peak pressure under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—the "remade hush" reweights grief as resistance without moralizing. Final line ("It wasn’t happiness, but it was enough") crystallizes earned ambiguity, avoiding thematic echo while charging prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice’s rhythmic control ("percussive thrum," "thin curls of wood that fell like whispers") embodies Elias’s psyche under pressure. Near-flaw: "grief had become contraband emotion" edges toward cliché, but specificity of "stage whisper for dust motes" rescues coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loop: "a quiet not of emptiness, but of deliberate peace" slightly echoes "remade hush." Minor redundancy deducts 0.2; otherwise, propulsion and density are exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian trope via micro-resistance (tea ritual as rebellion); the whittled bird’s fragility feels inevitable. Risk distinction: emotional specificity ("lightness in grief") avoids generic oppression narratives, but mandate premise lacks radical novelty.</comment>
