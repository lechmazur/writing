<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("boredom calcified into purpose") and embodied emotion under pressure feel earned, but the final choice lacks visible micro-struggle beyond "did not fight the curse," slightly undercutting the high-stakes causality at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with felt cost in "leaving behind a silent, shimmering sanctuary to be unmade," holding the Accumulative/Textural lens through the solar storm's intensifying pressure and spatial mutiny's pattern break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and amulet fragment constrain choices (e.g., refracted storm light as power source) and charge the final image, though solar storm mechanics lean slightly generic despite vivid sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency as Xylos manipulates magnetic fields, narrowing options to a single irreversible step; cost is unmistakable in the sanctuary's unmaking, though the "spatial mutiny" concept could deepen tactics earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "not-knowing" as thrill, avoiding moralizing; the final image reweights the premise without stating a moral, though the "hollow hellos" reflection risks slight abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("star-crushing boredom," "kaleidoscopic sanctuary") and rhythmic control under pressure shine, with elision of secondary characters taught early and paid off in the solitary climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold, though "calcified into purpose" borders on therapy-speak in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling the closure's immediacy without breaking momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic boredom and spatial physics feels inevitable; the "not-knowing" payoff transforms the immortal trope through specific, grounded stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
