<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("compress eternity") but lacks embodied cost during rupture; Operator's cryptic nature sacrifices contradictory impulses for thematic purity, weakening final endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (perfection sacrificed for potential), but the felt cost remains oblique; "task complete" implies sacrifice yet lacks visceral on-page weight for elite standards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glass orchard and frost patterns actively constrain choices (Operator guides ice growth) and charge the final image; "milky glass trees" reprise crystallizes the transformed stakes with perfect specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally through the whisper's destabilization, but the rupture's cost feels conceptual rather than embodied; Operator's calm after cosmic dissolution undermines visceral tension at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "rustling awakenings" as both action and metaphor; final image ("any story could begin") resonates without moralizing, though near-miss on overt thematic echo in "static perfection" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fingers light as spider-silk") and rhythmic control excel, but minor POV leakage in "the Operator knew" risks over-certainty; no head-hopping, yet compression slightly obscures emotional calibration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dry, expectant sound" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-miss on "intangible contents" (slight abstraction) but propulsion remains flawless through the rupture sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes "bottled whisper" trope into indispensable physics-defying mechanism; risk-taking (entropy as art) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "frost as code" feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
