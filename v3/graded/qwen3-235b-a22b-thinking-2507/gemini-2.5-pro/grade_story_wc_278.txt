<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "low-frequency hum" embodies guilt concretely. Micro-choice of etching with amber (not tools) reveals contradictory impulses as artisan/father. Final renunciation of guilt earns closure via prior causality, though Lyra's resolution leans slightly idealized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "Papa." + hum cessation crystallizes reconfigured meaning. Orientation anchors by word 30 ("studio," "city," "single lamp"). Accumulative lens holds—density shift in firmware text ("Cold. Scared." → "Bright. Singing.") tightens stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber functions as micro-setting: constrains choice (scratching server) and charges final "tombstone" image. City's "sprawling nebula" risks decorative vagueness, but "cold, sterile air" of lab mirrors emotional state. Environment qualifies for 9-band gate via amber's causal role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing guilt) signaled immediately via "hum only he could hear." Escalation driven by Elian's agency—etching constellation narrows options to one decisive act. Cost is unmistakable: hum's cessation reconfigures identity. Firmware's translation ability slightly convenient but earned via letters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through amber's duality (preservation/stasis) and "meteor hush" reweighting. Final image ("scar he no longer needed to hide") offers non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. Avoids false balance—guilt resolved through action, not redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "needle a whisper," "paper thin as moth's wing." Under stress, syntax compresses ("He had to hush it. He had to..."). Zero head-hopping; rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. "Sonic ghosts" slightly clichéd but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "gnat frozen mid-flight" charges density. Final line ("scar he no longer needed to hide") epitomizes textural specificity. Passive construction ("firmware had started to translate") intentional for sterile tech. Peak beats avoid figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via tech-poetics: haunted firmware translating cries into text. Amber as tool/tombstone synthesizes organic detail. "Laboratory of Lost Sounds" echoes real archives but baby-cry translation feels fresh. Risk-taking heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
