<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "work became perfunctory; his real work now lay in the ruins," showing embodied conflict. Final choice earns closure through prior causality, though grandfather's motivation lacks sufficient micro-choice anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "single clean line through the entry" and ink choice. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; orientation anchors by 80 words with "Midnight Ridgeway" establishing time/place stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reservoir bed's "cracked mud sucking at his boots" functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges closure. "Sapphire-hued label" evolves from discovery object to "vibrant jewel" in final image, directly charging thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency as photo trail transforms curiosity into moral duty. The archival ink act ("not an act of rage") delivers visible cost that alters community dynamics, perfectly calibrated under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "turning haunting into history" avoids moralizing while reweighting "mirrored hush" motif. Final image's "filled... with understanding" offers resonant non-literal answer to central question of truth's burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "loss felt measured in ghosts," with syntax tightening during photo discoveries. Rhythmic control under pressure flawless; zero head-hopping despite reflective moments taught early through concrete cues like the liqueur label.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "skeletal grin of Aethelburg" compresses setting/theme in one phrase. Final line's cadence shift ("not with noise, but with understanding") delivers propulsion without muddle, with ink choice demonstrating strategic density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "family secret" trope through archival precision (ink type, ledger mechanics). Emotional specificity in "grandfather hadn't been a liar, not truly" avoids generic templates, with reservoir's physicality resisting abstract everywhere settings.</comment>
