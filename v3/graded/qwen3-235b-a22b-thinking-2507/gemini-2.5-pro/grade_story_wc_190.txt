<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s "fluidly logical" trait drives micro-choices (pointing out light’s sound), while the passenger’s embodied anxiety (white knuckles, shallow breath) evolves credibly to calm. Her shift earns closure via visible cost (relaxed shoulders, deeper breath), though Elian’s solitude lacks contradictory impulses beyond his role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: her "clear eyes" and voice "part of the quiet" reconfigure silence with felt cost (overcoming fear). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density tightens stakes—without causality breaks. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("gondola operator," "drifting prism terraces").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prism terraces and Aether constrain choice (fear of silence/height) and charge the final "cathedral of peace" image. Storm glass vial’s reprise ("crystals are calm") reweights meaning. Micro-setting (gondola hull whisper) shapes the passenger’s transformation, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory accumulation (train ghost, light striking prism) deepens the dominant stake—silence as threat vs. comfort—with Elian’s agency driving her shift. Cost is unmistakable: her "panicked rhythm" to "deepened" breath forecloses fear. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action, not moralizing: the final "cathedral of peace" reweights silence as solace without stating a lesson. Subtext in gestures (unclenching hands) avoids thematic echo. Resonant answer to "loud silence" feels earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian’s perceptual signature ("fluidly logical instrument") filters all description, with rhythmic control modulating under pressure ("vaulting hush" to "cathedral"). Voice stays consistent; dialogue carries subtext ("listen *to* the silence"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High density and propulsion ("soft scuff of her shoe unnaturally loud") with zero loops. Minor scaffold in "state of perpetual transit" (redundant with "ferrying souls"), but closure image ("cathedral of peace") remains sharp. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: prism terraces and "Aether" transform transit tropes through specific stakes (silence as emotional catalyst). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens coherence—the passenger’s shift feels inevitable via sensory details, not gimmickry.</comment>
