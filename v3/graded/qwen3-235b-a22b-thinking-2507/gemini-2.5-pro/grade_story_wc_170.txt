<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied emotion through "borrowed heartbeat" and tactile light manipulation, but lacks contradictory impulses; calm exterior remains unchallenged, missing micro-choices under pressure during pivotal humming sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise as bells break the spell yet "ghost of possibility" lingers with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly through density shift from fractured light to dissolving harmony, reweighting stakes via the city's felt-but-unseen transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prism parapet's wet stone actively constrains the magic by refracting light at sunset, charging the final image where "light returned to simple sheen"; sensory details (slick stone, rainbows on hands) evolve causally with the ritual's progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (ephemeral hope vs. inevitable return to reality) tighten through the bell's approach, narrowing options to a single decisive moment; cost is legible in the "ghost of possibility" lingering behind glass after reflections normalize, though pressure lacks active opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mirrors showing "paths yet to be taken" reweights "what is" vs. "what could be" without moralizing; final image of lingering ghost after normal reflections resume offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of hope's value.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "liquid rainbows that danced on his hands" and city dwellers' embodied visions; rhythmic control deepens under pressure as humming expands into "vibration to be felt," with no head-hopping in single-POV lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "fractured light spilling from prism parapet" conducts color like an orchestra without muddle; final line "ephemeral as the mirages he painted" recharges opening shadow imagery with crystalline propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light physics and emotional alchemy transforms "mirage painter" trope; specificity of "coded lullabies" as medium avoids abstraction, though risk-taking stays within lyrical safety margins without pushing conceptual boundaries.</comment>
