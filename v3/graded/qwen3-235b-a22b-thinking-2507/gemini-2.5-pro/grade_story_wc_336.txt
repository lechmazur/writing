<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation clear but lacks contradictory impulses; "insatiably creative" trait isn't tested under pressure. Strength lies in embodied emotion during essence-capture ("hand over heart feeling steady rhythm"), yet interiority remains single-note devotion without genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as perfect Accumulative/Textural Charged Poise with visible cost ("grey film dissolved, revealing emerald deepness"). Lens holds throughout, though "hush of budding hope" timeframe lacks concrete pressure. Cost proof is unambiguous in the mosses' renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Waterfall mist functions as essential micro-setting that constrains the essence-capture method and charges closure. Parapet itself remains postcard-like, but the seed's transformation ("miniature galaxy") powerfully reweights the final image through tangible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elian's agency in gathering luminous threads, narrowing options through focus under pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the mosses' renewal, though cosmic stakes feel slightly abstract against the intimate action. One decisive intensification suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions: the seed's rebirth answers "preserving wonder" without moralizing. Final image ("orchard anchored by light") resonates as non-literal solution, avoiding Thematic Echo while embracing complexity through sensory rebirth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "velvet blue of profound peace" descriptions. Rhythm modulates perfectly from thunderous opening to "radiant hush," with controlled compression during essence-capture. Minor register drift in "kaleidoscope of hues" prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsed, once, twice" shows masterful compression. Final line ("anchored by light") charges closure with crystalline clarity. Slight overwriting in "incandescent gold of new idea" is purposeful but edges toward purple prose in one beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "magic seed" trope through concrete mechanics (weaving waterfall mist into essence). Emotional truth in "hand over heart" moment avoids abstraction. Freshness anchored in verifiable details like obsidian seed absorbing "ravenous thirst" of the world.</comment>
