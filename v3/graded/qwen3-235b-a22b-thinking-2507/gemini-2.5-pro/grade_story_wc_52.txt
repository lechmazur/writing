<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "contain him, not the whole man" and embodied micro-choices (handling wood, timed cut), but emotional progression lacks deeper irrationality beyond grief's surface layer; final renunciation earned through vivid memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: carving the exhale arc crystallizes stillness lesson with felt cost (ongoing grief vs. tangible anchor), under Accumulative lens where sensory density escalates pressure to reconfigured stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ash wood functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (carving stillness not lion) and charges final image; rain/kettle details evolve causally with emotional beats, avoiding symbolic convenience through tactile integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (containing essence vs. grief's totality) tightens through memory crystallization, narrowing options to one "usable part"; cost legible in effort of carving and "rust-hued peace" as earned compromise, though escalation lacks deeper tactical shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of control-as-presence emerges organically from cub memory and carving; final exhale arc reweights "here and gone" without moralizing, achieving conceptual repricing where ash grain becomes wisdom's vessel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("smell of worked ash," "ocean of stillness") sustains rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from hypnotic rain to kettle's shriek, with no head-hopping or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "simmer guides inward" does triple duty, though "hauntingly practical" repetition slightly muddles closure beat despite thematic purpose; propulsion flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lion taming/grief through wood carving avoids tropes; ash wood's resilience smell transforms "control" trope, though risk-taking stops short of bold structural experimentation within short form constraints.</comment>
