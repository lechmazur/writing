<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority vividly embodied ("thin and dusted with papyrus decay") but lacks contradictory impulses; motivation clear yet insufficiently conflicted under pressure. Final endurance earned but micro-choices lack hierarchy-shifting cost during pivotal burrowing sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "peace would crumble again" crystallizes irreversible cost within Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation solid by para 1; escalation via sensory saturation (Aeridor screams) reweights stakes without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge functions as micro-setting charging final image (river yielding to hand), but library details remain atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. Black sand river’s tactile specificity elevates closure’s emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via "collective gravity unmooring" mind; Aeridor chronicle deepens pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost legible through temporary renewal ("peace would crumble again"), though escalation lacks one visible tradeoff during transition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (river’s "liquid starlight" as unrecorded stories), avoiding abstraction. Final image reweights "witness without judgment" via silent river immersion, achieving resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust of ages was the only air fit to breathe") and rhythmic control under stress ("symphony of seawater and screams"). Voice modulation flawless during burrowing transition; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "paper soft as cloth, creased a thousand times" exemplifies high-density specificity. Minor scaffold in "ghosts of scribes/frantic whispers" setup, but closure beat ("watching it flow") achieves zero loops with crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms trope via sensory logic (ozone/wet stone transition, starlight river). Emotional truth in temporary renewal avoids fantasy clichés, though "regenerative silence" concept leans slightly familiar without deeper moral calculus.</comment>
