<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("heart still belonged to sea/actions chained to land") drives embodied micro-choices like compass trembling; closure earned through prior causality with visible cost ("broken tool in hand"). Avoids diagnostic label-speak despite peak regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "wasn't walking away... finally taking the first step" crystallizes stance with "flickering faith" and "broken tool." Accumulative lens holds—pressure builds through sensory accumulation, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Coastal launch micro-setting actively pressures choice (water lapping boots, kayakers' laughter); compass constrains action from retrieval to offering. Final image recharges utility poles as "discarded crutch" with tangible cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aligning heart/action) tightens through kayakers' laughter intensifying Elias' pull toward water. Agency in facing sea—foreclosing land-bound penance—with visceral cost ("phantom spray," "flickering candle" faith).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: astronomical compass reweighted from "judge" to offering. Final image rejects tidy moral—"broken tool" crystallizes navigation as human reckoning without redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: sailor noticing "placid water," "brine." Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences for trembling hand; lyrical reflection). Compression taught early ("For months he had walked...") pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised twilight sky" avoids cliché through specificity. Final image ("discarded crutch" shadow) crystallizes without overwriting. Propulsion via concrete verbs: "hummed," "lapped," "raised."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms "broken man at sea" trope through astronomical compass and utility poles. Emotional truth in "flickering faith" avoids sentimentality; risk-taking with Accumulative structure feels inevitable for this character.</comment>
