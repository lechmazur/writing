<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "breathless on her stool" crystallizes cost. Lacks contradictory impulses during vision sequence—Elara’s flaw doesn’t actively complicate her psychometry attempts until realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "unused love is never lost... becomes the soul of a place" reweights the premise via velvet seats/dust motes. Accumulative lens holds—density escalates through sensory accumulation to the breathless realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Projection booth’s plush velvet actively absorbs love, constraining the thematic resolution. Final image ("soul of a place") charges closure by transforming setting into emotional repository—environment directly shapes the answer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (where unused love is stored) deepens via Elara’s vision, narrowing options to absorption into the theater. Cost is felt in her breathless realization, charging the final image under Accumulative lens—escalation driven by sensory density, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (velvet seats, dust motes), avoiding moralizing. Final line "her work was done" offers non-literal answer to central question—love’s storage reweights the theater’s silence without abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust tasted of rust and regret" filters setting through Elara’s psyche. Rhythm modulates from fragmented tension ("She closed her eyes") to flowing vision sequences—no head-hopping, though "spatially imaginative" slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding; "hushed thunder" compresses theme into texture. Minor artifact: "pressure building behind a dam" mixes metaphors in a high-pressure beat, slightly muddling the vision’s intensity without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms psychometry trope via cinema history—love absorbed into physical space feels inevitable yet fresh. Bold risk: Accumulative structure replaces plot with sensory accumulation, heightening stakes without gimmickry ("soul of a place" as non-literal resolution).</comment>
