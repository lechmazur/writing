<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between freedom in erasure and yearning for memory texture manifests in layered micro-choices; embodied "violet of grief" avoids therapy-speak. Single-POV baseline fully satisfied though secondary character presence is fleeting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "I have not found my name... but I have touched the shape of a memory," crystallizing the erasure-as-living paradox. Accumulative lens held flawlessly through tidal rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stacked containers function as micro-setting constraining choice (hearing through rust-holes) and charging closure; "slick, green-bearded pylons" exemplify purpose-driven specificity. Recurring label anchors final image with tactile weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake escalation driven by accumulating fragments rather than protagonist agency weakens tightening under Accumulative lens; the woman's story arrives coincidentally rather than through active pursuit, diluting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges through "patchwork soul" metaphor without moralizing; final image reweights "conscious erasure" as living through textured memory fragments. Avoids thematic echo despite high abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sounds bend carrying weight of origins") and rhythmic control peak during layering sequence; non-standard punctuation ("caesura between shipment and dispersal") taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; "violet of grief" and "warm gold" metaphors avoid cliché through sensory specificity. Final line "a kind of living" achieves maximum propulsion with minimal words.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms erased-history trope via container-port setting and "layering" methodology; "conscious erasure" concept feels inevitable through lived detail rather than abstraction. Risk-taking heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
