<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: mystic-scientist duality drives his fatal blind spot. "Brutally literal" realization earns closure through embodied cost (kneeling on quartz), though "brutally" slightly over-articulates the epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: the sheared bolt image reconfigures his life’s work with undeniable conceptual cost ("earth beneath him made of broken steel"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; frost patterns tighten stakes causally without a single causal beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The frost-ice prism system constrains every choice: cold enables the refraction, quartz pedestal matters, and final image ties "quartz-littered ground" to shattered worldview. Micro-setting charges closure more powerfully than any landscape could.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prove objects absorb emotions") tightens through the dawn light sequence; pressure peaks when frost patterns resolve. Cost is visceral in the kneel and prism’s "heavier" weight—conceptual truth lands as physical burden without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely from the bolt schematic’s horror: "truest story" reweights "truthful lie" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by subverting expectations—love isn’t in the prism, only indifferent physics. Final line’s desolation resonates as earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "lattice of pale, crystalline stone" reflects his scientific mysticism. Syntax tightens under stress ("He recognized it instantly"), and "ghost of a rainbow" avoids cliché through precise physics-aware lexicon. Zero filter verbs in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "feathery detail" to "jagged diagram" shows escalating textural precision. Final paragraph’s rhythm ("cold, mechanical truth... broken steel... indifferent physics") crystallizes the cost. "Tremor in his gut" slightly generic but saved by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes via scientific rigor: the bolt schematic’s horror feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Emotional truth in mundane mechanical failure ("sheared bolt") synthesizes physics and loss uniquely. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
