<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Aris’s dual view of Tethys as prison/sanctuary; embodied grief in "fingers drumming complex patterns" avoids therapy-speak. Final endurance earns cost through the atlas symbol’s delayed recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the shimmering vision’s fade makes cost legible through Aris’s hands/console realization. Accumulative lens holds via rhythmic density escalation; rare tidal event tightens options without coincidence resolving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The console’s metal casing and atlas page function as micro-setting, constraining choice (tapping sequences) and charging the final image (hands on console). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—bleached reef bones versus electric coral—without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding Lena’s disappearance) tighten meaningfully via the neap tide/thermal inversion confluence. Agency drives escalation: Aris’s rhythm assembly forecloses the "drifting" path with felt cost (defeat before symbol discovery), reconfiguring options through his own action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "periodically eternal" reef reweights "drifting moored" without moralizing. Final image ("touch eternity") resonates as non-literal answer to paths disappearing, avoiding sentimentality via concrete coral/fish imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sun bled into the horizon" and "metronome swinging between data entry." Rhythmic control mirrors tapping obsession; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression (e.g., "Days bled into weeks") taught early pays off in climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Minor scaffold in "quiet, desperate need to understand" slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise clean propulsion; "skeletal monument" avoids cliché through concrete reef context. No loops, but "drifting on endless currents of memory" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ecological grief via rhythmic memory mechanics. "Periodically eternal" reframes time non-gimmickly; specificity of polyrhythmic tapping grounds the premise. Risk in quiet resolution heightens emotional truth without obscuring clarity.</comment>
