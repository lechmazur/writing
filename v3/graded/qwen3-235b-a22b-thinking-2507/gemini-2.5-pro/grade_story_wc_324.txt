<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority anchored in embodied detail ("throat working as if to swallow a stone") avoids therapy-speak, but Elias’ flawless competence lacks flaw-driven struggle that would deepen the Earned Stasis closure; Leo’s emotional contradiction ("failing at everything") feels authentic yet isolated from prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in Leo’s physical unraveling and recomposure ("shoulders slumped" to "deep breaths"), under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors ("mist-clad atrium at twilight") by line 3 avoid penalty, and pulse rhythm shift crystallizes the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hearing aid constrains choice (pulse interpretation) and charges the final image (signal fading as Leo calms), while "reeling hush" and fountain setting pressure emotional pacing; micro-setting avoids genericity but fog’s functional role beyond atmosphere is underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through the pulse rhythm’s shift from frantic to steady, narrowing options to a single act of assurance, but escalation leans slightly passive—the grandmother’s signal change resolves tension without Elias overcoming a meaningful obstacle, muting agency under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment><comment>Theme emerges through the hearing aid’s pulse as metaphor for inherited emotional rhythm, avoiding moralizing; the final image ("quiet reunion") offers non-literal resolution to grief’s weight, though "she’s sending you peace" borders on thematic echo, slightly diluting earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias’ clinical-poetic voice ("cartography of loss," "moth fluttering") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control ("frantic rhythm softening into a slow, steady beat") teaches and pays off the pulse motif without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("a cathedral of glass and steel where echoes went to die") propels momentum with concrete verbs, though "reeling hush" slightly overworks the rhythm motif in high-pressure beats without deeper payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Contact tracer for hearts" transforms grief tropes via specific auditory mechanics, but "incidental heroism" feels familiar; risk-taking in sensory closure (pulse as lullaby) heightens stakes, yet emotional resolution lacks the bold asymmetry that would push into 9.0+.</comment>
