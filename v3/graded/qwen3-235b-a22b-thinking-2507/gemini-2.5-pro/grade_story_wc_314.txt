<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when Elias abandons alembics yet instinctively maps starling vectors; "cold and sharp" frustration embodies his flaw. Final choice earned through micro-choices (softening focus, flame beneath leaf), but "profound internal shift" borders on abstraction without sufficient somatic detail in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: the vapor's "touch of wonder" crystallizes his stance shift with felt cost (dissolving rigid scaffolding). Accumulative lens holds—sensory density peaks as starlings warp into a vortex pointing to the tree, narrowing options to reverence. Cost legible in "frustration... threatening to freeze passion" melting into "impossibly new" readiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall fractures light like Elias’s rigid logic, while the dew crystal (micro-setting) charges closure—its sublimation into "silver vapor" directly enables his transformation. Dew-kissed leaf constrains choice by demanding non-contact warmth application, but orchard’s "moss-soft earth" lacks causal pressure on tactics beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (logic vs intuition) tightens through Elias’s renunciation of alembics and surrender to starling patterns, foreclosing pure analysis with visible cost (frustration). Agency drives escalation: his decision to observe without mapping directly enables the vortex revelation. Cost deepens when flame application sublimates—not melts—the crystal, reweighting "reverence" as the missing element.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete alchemy: "mathematical precision in fractal edges" fusing with "poetic chaos" of starlings avoids moralizing. Final image reweights the premise—logic/intuition as "sublime choir"—without stating it. Near-miss: "profound internal shift" risks abstraction, but vapor’s "ancient ice and new blossoms" scent grounds the insight in sensory cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: alchemist’s POV filters starlings as "vectors" then "living river," while "phosphor-wood" and "sublimated" reflect precise lexicon. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short clauses during starling observation ("He let go...") versus flowing syntax at transformation. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally as logic dissolves into grace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "kaleidoscopic waterfall fractured sunlight into dancing rainbows" compresses setting and theme economically. Minor overwriting: "ghost in his perfect equations" slightly strains metaphor, but "frozen dew crystal... six-sided jewel of impossible delicacy" earns specificity. Final line’s "ancient, sacred space... startlingly new" delivers resonant closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy tropes via intimate stakes—Elias’s secret edelweiss locket (not a potion) enables the climax. Fresh inflection: starlings as "living arrow" guiding to dew crystal avoids symbolic convenience. Derivative risk in "logic vs intuition" theme offset by visceral details (phosphor-wood flame, vapor’s scent), though emotional arc edges toward tidy resolution.</comment>
