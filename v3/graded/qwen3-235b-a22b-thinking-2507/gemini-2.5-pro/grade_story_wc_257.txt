<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully embodied through jewelry-maker's hands and micro-choices (crafting origami), though the woman's motivation emerges late with minimal prior friction, slightly undercutting mutual character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly—the projected constellations reconfigure meaning with visceral cost ("forge was small, but warm"), sustained by Accumulative/Textural lens where origami sequences deepen cosmic perspective without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory functions as vital micro-setting: the vellum stencil physically constrains Elias' actions (folding into lotus) and charges the final image, while "curtains of intention" manifest through her hesitant steps and the dome's responsive light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias' origami campaign—each folded messenger narrows his emotional isolation while deepening her curiosity, culminating in the lotus coordinates' visible cost: his vulnerability in stepping from shadows with Anya's stencil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from "withering to bloom" metaphor reweighted by cosmic artifice; final image of her designing a star pendant answers the central question without moralizing, though "teach darkness to bloom" risks slight thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("hands once deft at coaxing joy from metal") modulates rhythm under grief; compression of time jumps taught early via origami sequences pays off in closure’s resonant silence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but "grief had been a smith hammering his soul" slightly overwrites a pivotal beat; otherwise, high-density propulsion ("snipped... crafted... left") and precise verbs ("nascent curiosity was enough") drive momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms mourning tropes through jewelry-maker specificity and "genuinely artificial" cosmos; the observatory’s sentient curtains feel fresh when tied to tactile origami mechanics rather than abstract metaphor.</comment>
