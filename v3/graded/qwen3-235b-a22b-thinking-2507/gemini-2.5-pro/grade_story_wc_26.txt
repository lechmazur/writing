<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines via embodied micro-choices (fingers recoiling, stone grip), but Elara’s "luminous regret" motivation lacks contradictory impulses in climax. Final renunciation earned, though secondary pressure absent limits crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with cost (permanent regret), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Hybrid) past midpoint caps score. Orientation clear by 50 words; cost proof solid in "luminous, permanent resident" final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Library setting functions as micro-setting: spectral vines constrain tactics (comparison method), and river stone’s warmth charges the final image. Sensory details filtered through Kael’s archival focus avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Kael’s agency (comparison method), but escalation lacks visible price until closure. Shadow’s origin revelation deepens knowledge meaningfully, though dominant stake (preserving hope’s shape) could feel more viscerally urgent earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the river stone’s transformation and frost-tinged dawn imagery. Avoids moralizing; final image reweights "hope" as sorrow-infused resilience without abstraction. Slightly underdeveloped counter-readings limit 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dusk noticer," spectral light-vines) and rhythmic control in comparison scenes. Minor register drift with "metamorphosis" but elision (dream origin) taught early and paid off. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "fingers curling inward" shows textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("a slow, insidious metamorphosis, a poisonous vine") triggers -0.2. No closure artifacts; final line’s "shape of hope" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival sci-fi and grief; "shadow as cage" trope transformed through specific video comparison method. Emotional truth in accepting darkness as hope’s price avoids safety middle. Missing one bold structural risk for 9+.</comment>
