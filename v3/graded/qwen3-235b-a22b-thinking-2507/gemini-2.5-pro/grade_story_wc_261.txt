<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: seeking closure tears scabs, embodied in gasp/tremor when reopening wounds. Final renunciation ("carry them") earned by tunneling sequence where he discovers the "violent tearing" beneath promised healing. No diagnostic labels; ivy’s withdrawal reveals impact on environment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: "search for closure was the very thing that kept him wounded" crystallizes with visceral cost ("raw, vibrating agony," ivy’s withdrawal). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sensory pressure (coffee rings, ivy pulse) reweights stakes. Meteor hush’s "heaviness" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tower setting constrains choice: ivy’s "slow green pulse" actively bleeds into memory, forcing confrontation with plant’s pruning trauma. Hourglass’s clouded sand mirrors obscured truth; final "sterile, golden light" charges closure. Micro-setting (coffee rings as "cryptic archipelago") directly shapes navigation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency: tunneling reveals scar’s "violent tearing," not clean slice, narrowing options to painful acceptance. Cost is felt in "tremor" and ivy’s panic—visible tradeoff when reopening wounds. Dominant stake (closure vs. perpetual wounding) deepens via coffee-ring ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "door ripped from hinges" reweights scar narratives without moralizing. Final image ("quiet, lonely archivist") offers resonant answer to central question. Avoids thematic echo—wisdom arises from tunneling struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: medical lexicon ("psychic soil," "cauterized") fused with botanical precision ("pale, puckered line"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("meteor hush") to staccato ("He gasped") under pressure. Pattern taught early via "accidental telepathy" and paid off in ivy’s withdrawal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "cryptic archipelago" and "door ripped from hinges" do triple duty. Final line crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor deduction for "psychic soil" (slight register drift), but propulsion remains relentless—sentences accelerate during tunneling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "healing narrative" trope via scar archaeology: displaced miracle (plant telepathy) isn’t gimmick but causal engine for climax. "Meteor hush" as sustained tone device feels fresh. Risk-taking (lyric structure) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
