<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via Elias' "shrewdly innocent" persona masking coral-fueled anxiety; micro-choices like decoding symbols reveal values with cost ("lotus-hearted ache" embodies paternal grief). General's vulnerability feels earned through thunder callback, avoiding stock "hard commander" tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: General's "subtle, sharp motion in his throat" crystallizes stance shift while mist "imperceptibly cleared" reweights shared vulnerability. Accumulative lens holds—symbol decryption tightens pressure by narrowing options to human connection, no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: diffused twilight and swirling glass directly pressure choices (hushed tones enable secret-sharing; mist "imperceptibly cleared" charges closure). Coral fragment constrains Elias' tactics—its density mirrors his "unknot" instinct, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias' agency: decoding symbols transforms abstract "shared anxieties" into visceral stakes ("fear of thunder" mirrors General's pain). Cost is unmistakable—the swallowed motion shows foreclosed path—but lacks one more tightening beat before climax to hit 8.8+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: honey-cakes and thunder reweight conflict as universal grief, not political binary. Final image ("something imperceptibly cleared") offers non-literal answer without moralizing, with mist's clearing charging conceptual cost of vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "pitted coral" and "graphite smudges" through translator's lens. Rhythmic control shines under pressure—shortened syntax during decryption ("Secrets," she mumbled) contrasts with lyrical closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during General's entrance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("worried," "dissolving," "swallowed"). One borderline filter verb ("he felt a familiar pull") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-motivated. Final line's "imperceptibly cleared" achieves high density without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms ceasefire trope through specific lens: shared anxieties reframed via child's cast symbols. Emotional truth in General's micro-reaction avoids sentimentality. Fresh inflection lies in grafting "new meaning onto old wounds" through honey-cakes/thunder—not grand speeches.</comment>
