<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines: "impatience as a wild animal" clawing while she sculpts patience into victory. Final choice earned through embodied restraint ("steady hand," "quiet click") with visible cost in the vanished hum. Minor deduction for "old fury" bordering label-speak, though redeemed by action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Charged Poise: viaduct lights dying crystallizes the cost ("oppressive hum vanished") under a causal lens. Orientation anchors within 50 words ("basalt sanctuary," "frozen lake"). No flaws—causal chain (rain → wet viaduct → moon resonance → signal) drives the decisive change with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Wet magnetic viaduct constrains the entire climax—it enables the moon’s reflection that triggers the network failure. Final image ("profound quiet of the frozen lake") charges the setting by contrasting the vanished hum. Slight deduction for underused tactile senses during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Escalation is pure protagonist agency: months of observation narrow to Lyra’s meridian approach, forcing the "quiet click" with immediate cost (hum vanishing). Dominant stake ("patient revolution") tightens meaningfully as the chronometer ticks. Only flaw: "wildness" could manifest more actively during the climax beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—patience as active rebellion, not passivity—answered by the "new horizon... of freedom" without moralizing. "Sculpt patience from impatience" evolves from internal struggle to victory’s "serene and terrible shape." Avoids thematic echo; cost is visceral in the silenced hum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "water from the deepest aquifer sloshed... perfect dark mirror" reflects her mapper’s precision. Rhythm modulates masterfully—lyrical observation to staccato climax ("flickered once, twice, died"). Minor deduction for "purpose was not to rage" bordering abstract telling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("scrying bowl trembled... ripple disturbed the water" packs cause/effect). Final line avoids cliché with "serene and terrible shape." Deduction for "her purpose was not to rage" slightly over-telling, though context saves it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: celestial mechanics as rebellion tool subverts dystopia tropes. "Vigilant horizon mapper" feels organic, not gimmicky. Emotional truth in impatience/patience duality elevates familiar frozen-dystopia setting. Risk-taking (quiet revolution) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
