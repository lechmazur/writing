<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (creating permanence vs. accepting impermanence) drives the abandonment choice. Minor deduction for near-diagnostic phrasing in the thawing heart realization that edges toward thematic echo without sufficient embodied cost in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost: the collapsing sphere and physical wrench of abandonment crystallize the foreclosed path. Causal lens holds perfectly—structural failure forces the renunciation, with the cost legible in "fiery puddle" and fleeing motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels (corroded pipe’s drip, melting ice groans), but the control room fails as micro-setting—it doesn’t constrain choices during crisis. Bookmark charges the final image yet lacks active pressure on tactics earlier, capping just below 9-band per gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her choice to continue working despite warnings tightens the noose. Cost is unmistakable—the abandoned sphere and shattered purpose reweight stakes under the causal lens, with the structural failure narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete reweighting: the bookmark’s transformation from "shattering ice" to "steady river flow" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Final image avoids abstraction by grounding insight in sensory action (sun warming skin, slipping bookmark into pocket).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("thoughtfully spirited grace," glassblower’s tactile focus), with rhythmic compression during collapse ("The floor tilted sickeningly"). Slight register drift in "weighty lightness" nips at 9-band eligibility but doesn’t break coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats; high density with "fiery puddle" crystallizing cost. Minor paraphrase redundancy ("painful, slushy ache"/"crystalline prison") prevents 9-band, but no figurative muddle dulls the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glassblowing as intellectual safe-zone creation avoids thawing tropes through occupational specificity. Emotional truth in "quiet, steady trickle" transforms a familiar concept with irreplaceable detail (bookmark’s map-like cracks → river imagery).</comment>
