<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs honoring promise) manifest physically when nearly hurling tile then transcribing; grief-to-acceptance shift earned through prior study and storm-triggered memory. No diagnostic labels, embodied cost in "trembling, courageously kind hands."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: skepticism "washed from him" shows visible cost through transformed stance. Accumulative lens holds—storm’s sensory narrowing enables breakthrough. Orientation clear by line 5 ("skeletal remains of stargazer’s tower").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tower’s unglazed archways critically transmit whale songs enabling method; obsidian tile’s "shallow grooves" constrain transcription. Final image ("whale songs... enduring rhythm of love") charges closure through micro-setting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sculpting memory sanctuary) tightens via storm’s sensory pressure narrowing options to whale/star conversion. Cost legible in skepticism’s dissolution; agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens makes "profound acceptance" feel earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: transcribing whale/star data onto tile, not abstraction. Final image reweights "unheard symphony" into "enduring rhythm of love" without moralizing—resonant non-literal answer to entanglement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature sharp: scientific POV filters details ("cataloging ghosts," "converting sound and light"). Storm pressure compresses syntax ("Rain lashed... whale songs grew urgent") while maintaining distinct rhythm. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minor scaffolding in "cataloging ghosts" parallelism, but zero loops or register drift. Final line’s rhythm ("enduring rhythm of a love that spanned...") achieves lyrical precision without muddle. High density in climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: whale songs as celestial navigation tool reframes "cosmic echoes" from poetic to scientific. Fresh inflection through specific acoustic-celestial calculus; avoids middle-ground hedging with bold sensory fusion.</comment>
