<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "cry wolf boy" legacy versus truth-seeking, embodied through tactile door exploration; micro-choice to break the seal earns closure with visible cost of disbelief. Father's backstory avoids summary via concrete "whispers" pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the hush is mine now" crystallizes reclaimed narrative authority against coast guard's doubt, with conceptual cost in "echoes of my father’s fictions." Accumulative lens holds; disorientation waived by early setting anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison’s "copperlight repose" and jagged reef constrain every choice—door’s rust dictates pacing, confessional lattice enables climax. Final image of "silent, judging stones" charges closure with environmental cost. Micro-setting mastery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving truth against inherited disbelief) tightens via coast guard’s approach, but timeframe lacks tactical urgency; protagonist’s agency in breaking the seal narrows options decisively. Cost legible in inevitable dismissal of his story.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "hush" as sustained impossibility: final image reweights "copper light and silent stones" into resonant answer about truth’s cost without moralizing. Avoids binaries—father’s fictions versus real sins coexist with nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "shadows held their breath" and "salt air failed to erode sorrows." Voice modulates from lyrical ("rust and time") to raw ("knife loose on floorboards") without POV drift. Zero dialogue avoids pitfalls.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies perfectly ("stitching gray sea to gray sky" → short beats at climax), but paraphrase loop in "scuffs on narrow door left ajar for decades" costs 0.1. No figurative muddle; "drowned sun" metaphor deepens stakes without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "cry wolf" trope through lighthouse physics and moral ambiguity—truth isn’t redemptive but isolating. Specificity ("diamond-patterned lattice," "rotting wool") avoids genericity. Risk in quiet ending pays off via charged final image.</comment>
