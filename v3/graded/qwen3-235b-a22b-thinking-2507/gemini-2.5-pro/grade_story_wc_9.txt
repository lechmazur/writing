<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; "anxiety that had clawed at her throat" embodies contradiction between love and loss. Final choice to trace the hand is earned by spoiled linen ritual and saucer symbolism, with visible cost in cloak release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with legible cost: "a profound calm replaced the anxiety that had clawed at her throat" crystallizes her renunciation. Accumulative lens holds—density of starlight/cloud imagery tightens into the hand-tracing moment without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the cracked saucer and linen constrain choices (smudged ritual → new tracing), charging the final image. Glade’s "choking beauty" pressures her stance, though altitude’s physical impact could deepen tactics slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (recovering lost time) deepens via Accumulative lens—sensory density (ozone, phosphorescent moss) reweights time as "vapor" with felt cost. Agency shines in her decision to trace the hand, though "vapor" insight borders on telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through linen/saucer motifs: final hand-tracing offers non-literal answer to "where lost time accumulates" without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in concrete actions ("teach her about stars as simple lights").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: cartomancer’s tactile focus ("cool ceramic," "thrumming energy") modulates under stress. Rhythmic control elevates climax ("The silver clasp gave way with a soft click"), though "fractured heart" slightly dilutes voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops; "phosphorescent moss that pulsed" does triple duty (sensory/atmosphere/symbol). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting. One borderline tell: "testament to clumsiness" risks abstraction but is anchored by prior ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cartomancer lens transforms motherhood anxiety into "cloudbound repentance." Emotional specificity ("terrifying undertow of loss") avoids templates, though premise isn’t radically new. Risk-taking heightens stakes via cosmic scale.</comment>
