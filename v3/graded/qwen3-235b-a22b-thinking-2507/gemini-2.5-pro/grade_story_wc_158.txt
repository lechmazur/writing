<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in the shift from "metabolizing sorrow" to reef-shadow joy; micro-choices like turning the postcard reveal values. Slight overstatement of "photosynthesize pain" motivation early slightly weakens organic emergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the transformed sound carries "melancholy woven with acceptance." Escalation under Accumulative lens feels slightly rushed in the pivotal shift ("one cycle" transition lacks sufficient deepening pressure).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shell actively constrains choices—lodging the postcard in its "pearlescent crevice" where moonlight strikes charges the final image. Micro-setting (postcard) evolves from longing object to integrated artifact of transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (longing vs. creation) tightens meaningfully through Elara’s agency in reinterpreting pain. Cost is legible but lacks visceral on-page manifestation during the pivotal shift; the "sand grinding into pearl" metaphor feels slightly abstract for required pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action: "reef built from bones of a billion tiny lives" crystallizes the non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; the final sound’s "strange and comforting peace" resonates without explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("nacreous walls," "off-key wind") reflects Elara’s poetic insomnia. Rhythmic control peaks in the climax: "a reef-shadow joy that acknowledged the darkness while celebrating the light." Minor generic phrase ("phantom limb of the soul") barely dents mastery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves near-perfect density and propulsion ("verse by verse, she was building a garden from a wound"). Deducted 0.2 for adjacent paraphrase loop: "pain did not lessen... texture shifted" followed by "familiar torment started to feel less like a cage."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms the "lonely artist" trope through biological metaphors (reef, pearl, photosynthesis). "Blossom armistice" feels inevitable yet fresh; risk-taking in internal shift heightens stakes without gimmickry. Shell-as-resonator elevates specificity.</comment>
