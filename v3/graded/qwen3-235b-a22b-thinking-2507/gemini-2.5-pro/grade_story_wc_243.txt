<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's embodied contradiction—preserving small moments while confronting historical erasure—drives every choice. Her walnut-stained fingers and "haunted euphoria" avoid therapy-speak, with micro-choices like the risky photo steeping revealing her hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the jetty's phosphorescent blooms crystallize the covenant's rebirth with visceral cost ("weight of a hundred years of pointless animosity"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the photo's revelation tightens stakes through sensory accumulation, not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The locket and jetty function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge closure: the fragile photo demands Elara's chemical baptism, while the blooming jetty physically manifests the regenerated covenant in the final image, making stakes tangible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elara's agency alone until Tomas appears—the "soft, bruised evening" timing narrows options as the photo reveals founders' love, reweighting the feud's absurdity. Cost is legible in the "ghosts of generations who lived and died by a lie" haunting her euphoria.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: the locket's water-damaged blur transforming into sea-lavender offering reweights "covenant" from political treaty to love. No moralizing—final image of phosphorescent blooms answers the central question with resonant, non-literal truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("patient archaeology of the mundane," "chemical covenant") filters every detail through Elara's archivist lens. Rhythmic control peaks in the restoration scene—"hours bled into a soft, bruised evening"—where compression serves pressure without losing texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "milky, water-damaged blur" and "phosphorescent buds" achieve textural specificity with propulsion. Figurative language ("summons," "ghost of the image") is sparse and earned, never muddling the high-pressure restoration beat or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms feud trope through archivist's lens: the walnut-stained hands restoring a locket—not a treaty—makes the "regenerated covenant" feel newly urgent. Blooming jetty avoids sentimentality by tying botanical miracle to tangible cost (generational waste).</comment>
