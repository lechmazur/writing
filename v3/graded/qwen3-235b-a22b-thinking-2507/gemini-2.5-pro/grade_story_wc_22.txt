<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("narrow vastness") embodied through micro-choices like interpreting gull calls as "ocean's frantic librarians." Final endurance ("He would be back tomorrow") earns closure with visible cost (aching back, lighter satchel) foreclosing restoration fantasy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: gull calls' density reweights "submerged concord" stake. Closure as Charged Poise ("narrow line of hope against vast dark") with legible cost in "back aching, satchel significantly lighter." Anchors clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Jetty fissure actively constrains choice ("fingers working soil into stone"), while seed pods charge closure as "translated submerged concord." Sensory selection reflects urgency: calm perception of blooms vs. tactile soil focus during planting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: gull translations narrow options to precise locations ("Three paces west"), changing tactics with visible cost (physical strain). Dominant stake crystallizes through "iron-hard seed" planting sequence, reweighting loss with fragile hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("garden on a gravestone") offers resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting "narrow vastness" through concrete action. Avoids false equivalence—reef's death is irreversible, yet "deliberate patches" charge thematic complexity with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "chemiluminescent blossoms" and gull calls as "last remembered verses" reflect character-specific noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure—compressed diction during planting ("He rose and began his work")—avoids head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "air was a contradiction" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Peak-beat clarity in planting sequence: "pressed each seed into its prepared bed" avoids figurative muddle. Final line propulsion ("He would be back tomorrow") charges closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms eco-grief trope through specific synthesis: "gloom-hill coachman" (not gardener), seed pods as "library of potential futures." Risk-taking lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring Charged Poise closure.</comment>
