<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shown via fragmented memory vs duty; embodied emotion in "melody felt like yellow"; micro-choices tending plants reveal value hierarchy. Lacks deeper contradictory impulses during climax under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost: "first step toward healing" shows effort expended but realm still fragile. Orientation clear by 50 words; Accumulative lens (density of song fragments) held through crystallization of the tiny sun.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard micro-setting directly constrains choices—Sun-Drop Fern triggers melody, Shadow-Vine yields lyrics. Final image transforms mica window into "abstract painting of hope," charging closure with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative escalation via patterned song-fragment accumulation reweights stakes; cost legible in "first step toward healing." Agency clear but cost visibility slightly muted—effort expended lacks tangible consequence beyond memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "songs knit communities" motif without moralizing; final image reweights memory as hope. "Knits communities" borders on thematic echo, risking didacticism without full dramatic embodiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "melody felt like yellow" filters world through synesthesia. Rhythmic control shifts from fractured fragments to fluid cadence during song. No head-hopping; stress compression ("voice thin as spider’s thread") maintains voice integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("gossamer-winged Petal-Moths" conveys texture/action/theme). Final line’s "abstract painting of hope" crystallizes theme without overwriting. Minor metaphor tension in "heavy cloak" doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" transforms singing trope through alchemical specificity; emotional truth in broken-memory-as-salvation avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking with Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though mirror-world timeframe lacks freshness.</comment>
