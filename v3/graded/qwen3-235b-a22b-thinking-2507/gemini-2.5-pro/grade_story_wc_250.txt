<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (pity vs resolve) drive the final shutter choice with visible cost; embodied emotion in "spiralingly calm nature coalescing" avoids therapy-speak. Slight BRR friction with the child's secret backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "quiet that felt like sleep rather than dread"; Accumulative lens holds through light-pattern density escalation. Minor BRR violation with the child's secret doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Cobalt dock's rain-slicked surface and dental mirror constrain every choice; final shutter sliver charges the setting with permanent vulnerability. Micro-setting functions as essential pressure point for the entire resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately via "lonely darkness"; Kaelen's agency deepens pressure through shutter-weaving under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the kept-open shutter—a tangible, ongoing commitment to vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "teaching darkness the value of stars" shown via light-weaving, not stated. Final image reweights loneliness into connection without moralizing, though "half-spoken secret" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "gradations of grey" and "surgical precision"; rhythm modulates perfectly from fluid shutter-weaving to staccato tension. Zero POV leakage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; sentences multitask ("dark mirror disturbed only by memory of downpour" establishes setting/mood/plot). Final line avoids cliché with concrete image. "Spiralingly" slightly awkward but voice-appropriate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms light/dark trope through occupational specificity (dental mirror) and Accumulative structure. Emotional truth in treating darkness as something to understand, not banish; risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
