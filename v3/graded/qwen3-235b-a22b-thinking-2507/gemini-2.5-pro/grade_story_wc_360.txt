<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation for Elias's mathematical pursuit is clear but lacks internal conflict; Anya's passive endurance earns closure but misses contradictory impulses during the press operation. "Unmake a feeling" triggers diagnostic label-speak penalty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with Anya's recontextualized grief, but Accumulative escalation lacks one intensifying beat where Elias's method falters under pressure. Orientation perfect by word 15.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Topaz walls function as micro-setting that actively constrains the lens focus and charges the final nebula-ink symbol. Workshop isn't backdrop but tactile tool enabling the transposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grief's shape vs. feeling) tightens coherently, but Anya's passivity prevents her agency from driving escalation. Cost is legible but not earned through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—no moralizing. Final image ("map of her own heart") reweights grief's nature as a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures (Elias's mechanical precision vs. Anya's tremors) shine, but "lucid turbulence" lacks specificity under peak pressure. Voice modulation flawless otherwise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "metal slugs clicking like bones" does triple duty. One generic phrase ("unbearable weight") slightly dulls embodied emotion in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms letterpress trope through mathematical empathy, but "grief as map" metaphor lacks fresh inflection. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
