<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction evident in Elias's meticulous ritual versus trembling hands after partial failure; embodied emotion ("tremor in his hands") shows cost without label-speak. Lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in peak action to reach 9.0 band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise ("proven the path... patiently waiting") reconfigures options with felt cost ("tremor in his hands"). Accumulative lens holds: sensory density escalation (ozone, chromatic shimmer) tightens stakes. Cost proof anchored in physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting of the scarf's "scent of rain and forgotten perfume" constrains the ritual and charges the final image (folding it reverently). Library's "dry, paper-scented air" returning post-vision mirrors altered reality, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: scarf draping escalates pressure until vision appears/dissolves, foreclosing immediate capture. Cost legible in "tremor" and deferred victory ("had not captured"). Accumulative escalation via sensory saturation (ozone, bending light) reweights dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stories as tangible places emerges through ritual, not stated; final image ("quiet smile... waiting for next right time") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo while charging prior material via "universe of secrets" reprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in geometric noticing ("impossible curves where parallel lines diverged"); rhythmic control peaks during ritual ("low thrum... below hearing, felt deep in the bones"). Zero head-hopping, voice modulates from clinical to transcendent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "chromatic shimmer" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "manifold, a surface that could be bent" risks abstraction but saved by tactile follow-up ("pulling it taut"). Closure image crystal-clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "finding stories" trope through hyperbolic geometry ritual; specificity ("Mandelbrot set verse") creates freshness. Emotional truth in quiet obsession avoids gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable: scientific poetry library essential to premise.</comment>
