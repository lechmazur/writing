<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; embodied emotion in "phantom limb of lost connection" and breathing cycles. Contradictory impulses (clarity vs mystery) drive micro-choices without tidy resolution. Final endurance earns cost through visceral shift from "void" to "resonance."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the "shimmering motes" reconfiguration makes cost legible ("ache... changing its nature"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; breathing cycles deepen the dominant stake without causal breaks. Final image reweights love's storage with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Twilight viaduct functions as micro-setting: jasmine blooms constrain Elara's focus and charge the final image. Sensory details ("moon-jasmine," "coolness of air") evolve with emotional urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome. The camera obscura's tool logic directly shapes closure's luminous revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (love's storage) tightens through breathing cycles: inhale reveals pain, exhale dissolves it into the answer. Agency-driven deepening as Elara syncs breath to "phantom pulse," narrowing options to one transformative exhale. Cost crystallizes in the shift from "void" to "resonance" without retroactive fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "love becomes light for other things to grow by" avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in the jasmine sparks. Final image reweights the central question non-literally, with "tenacious beauty" charging closure. No thematic echo; complexity lingers in "not vanishing, but changing its nature."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "light that lived behind images" filters all description. Rhythmic control under pressure via breath-synced sentences ("In, clarity. Out, mystery"). Zero head-hopping; compression of "past life memory" remains anchored to camera obscura mechanics without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose avoids loops but "tenacious beauty of the flower gripping the stone" slightly overwrites; otherwise, high density with propulsion ("shuddering exhalation" → "saw it"). Final line’s "magnificent, ordinary view" achieves earned simplicity. No closure artifacts, but one borderline ornamental phrase limits 9.0+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of physics/spirituality: breathing as lens for love’s transformation feels inevitable. Avoids derivative "soul-searching" tropes through camera obscura mechanics. Risk-taking heightens stakes via Accumulative lens, with specificity ("kwan yin’s tear" refracting "twilight in ways geometry could not explain") grounding universals.</comment>
