<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("foolish ambition" vs "naivete shield") and embodied struggle shown through magic depletion; micro-choice adjusting drips reveals hierarchy of values. Lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost (exhaustion, spent magic) and conceptual cost (world's rebirth as "a start"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; "silence between drips" shift tightens pressure causally. Orientation clear by 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct actively constrains choice (vibration requirement) and charges final image (dust darkening via hum). Crystalline walkway's properties enable the solution; ochre dust's specificity makes moisture patch resonate. Micro-setting (bell fragments) essential to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuilding the song) tightens through Kael's methodical deepening, but pressure remains purely internal. Cost (magic depletion) is visible, yet external stakes lack escalation. Agency drives the drip adjustment, but world's response feels coincidental rather than earned causally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "plink, plink" mockery evolving into "ting... tong" harmony. Final image ("tiny circle of impossible moisture") offers non-literal answer to "world sleeping" question without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("pilot light not conjurer’s flame," "elegy for a world") with rhythm mirroring water drips. Stress compresses diction ("Ting… tong") without voice drift. Zero filter verbs; psychic distance modulates perfectly from apathy to weary hope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "ochre dust darkened" exemplifies textural specificity. One abstract phrase ("cosmic imbalance") in setup slightly dulls momentum, but "dripping rates" progression shows high density. Final line’s concrete charge overcomes minor early abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "chosen one" trope through specificity: lukewarm mage using broken bell and water physics. Risk-taking in climax (auditory shift vs explosive magic) heightens stakes coherently. "Plausible impossibility" tone avoids sentimentality while feeling inevitable.</comment>
