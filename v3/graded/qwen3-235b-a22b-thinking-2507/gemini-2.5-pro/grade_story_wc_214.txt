<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kael’s janitorial duty versus spiritual seeking; embodied vulnerability peaks when he "felt the violent, frictional heat" without diagnostic labels. Final choice to embrace fragility earns through years of prior observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost: "dust was simply the memory of light" reconfigures his entire existence under Accumulative lens. Pressure deepens via ritual repetition until empathetic breakthrough forecloses detachment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Tracking station functions as micro-setting that charges closure; dormant guidance arms and yellow glass constrain his ritual. Final image of "dust" as "memory of light" transforms setting into thematic engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize when "he wanted to feel" – agency-driven deepening narrows options from observation to empathy. Cost is legible in the whispered realization that dust holds "magnificent, vulnerable journey," reweighting fragility as strength.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through meteor’s "fiery grace," avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights vulnerability as "ultimate expression" without stating a moral, earning resonance through concrete dust-to-light transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels in "drifts of ancient starlight" noticing, but "primal elegance" slightly drifts from Kael’s lexicon. Rhythmic control falters minimally in symphony simile, though compression teaches its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with "fertile, allowing inquiries to grow like moss" as sole paraphrase loop. Final line’s "fiery grace" avoids cliché through precise antecedent in meteor’s journey, charging closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic janitor trope via yellow glass ritual; specificity in "solar sailor" salvage and vulnerability-as-strength calculus avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in quiet climax earns through earned emotional truth.</comment>
