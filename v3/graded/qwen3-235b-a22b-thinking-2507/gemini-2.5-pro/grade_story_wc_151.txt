<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation ("meaning in margins") clear but lacks embodied conflict in pivotal moments; the final sealing lacks visible struggle despite conceptual stakes. Micro-choices under pressure (chalk precision) reveal values but without layered emotional contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise holding the letter) lands with conceptual cost (fragility of analog trust), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks density increase—chalk drawing proceeds smoothly without deepening pressure or pattern break to reweight stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (chalk dust on trousers, holographic ghosts) anchor the world, but the arcade setting enables rather than constrains choices; the envelope—not the environment—charges the final image, missing the 9+ gate for micro-setting constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure identity transmission) signaled early, but pressure never tightens—no complication tests the method (e.g., wind smudging chalk, drone proximity). For Accumulative lens, density fails to intensify; cost remains abstract despite the "fragile timeframe" setup.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars (chalk codes as "discarded threads"), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("tangible piece of hope") offers resonant non-literal answer, though "quiet meaning inscribed not on a screen" slightly edges toward thematic echo in the closing line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("holographic ghosts of yesterday’s high scores") and rhythmic control shine, especially under pressure ("focused grace, precise yet fluid"). Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from sterile arcade to tactile chalk work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("silent, waiting machines" then "silent, meaningless scrawl") and slight scaffold in the final paragraph ("His work was done...") prevent 9.0, but propulsion remains strong with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "pseudonym creator" using children's chalk as smokescreen feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk in centering tension on philosophical stakes (analog trust) rather than physical danger, heightening coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
