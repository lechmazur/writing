<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "true motivation" vs maintenance role; micro-choices like silver tweezers reveal reverence without therapy-speak. Slight idealization of calm during crisis prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: shard’s "frantic lines" softening into "serene acceptance" reconfigures grief’s meaning. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through storm-to-dawn cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sextant’s broken lens constrains analysis method ("shattered coherence" enabling emotional interface), directly charging the climax where moonlight transforms the shard. Micro-setting essential to closure’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally: shard’s "internal misery" → sorrow-meter spike → moonlight transformation. Cost is visceral in the shard’s shift from "weeping tragic story" to "neutral warmth," reweighting grief’s purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sapling’s death sequence; final mosaic placement offers resonant answer: "not to fix sadness but give it a home." Avoids moralizing by rooting insight in shard’s physical transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "dust motes... patient art of settling" reflects Aris’s obsession. Minor deduction for "steady hand" under crisis slightly undermining stress compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sapling reaching for sun... nesting birds" compresses time/emotion efficiently. Near-duplicate in moonlight descriptions ("fractured by storm clouds" → "pure unfiltered") barely avoids artifact penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "quantified sorrow" transforms grief into scientific witness, avoiding cliché through sextant mechanics. Derivative guardrail passed via tree-rings-as-feelings specificity.</comment>
