<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "fool's errand" admission versus desperate need to translate convergence; micro-choices (offering story over brooch) reveal hierarchy of values with embodied cost ("heavier and more nourishing"). Woman's minimal presence limits relationship crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "holding the grain, not the chaff" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("heavier... than any nutrient bar"). Accumulative lens holds through rain-trail pressure; squall's arrival slightly coincidental but acceptable as pressure compounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Tidal island actively constrains choices (causeway access, mud trails); amber brooch charges final image as "fossilized light" in sketch. Sensory hierarchy perfect: painter notices "chaotic calligraphy" of runoff while ignoring nutrient bar's taste.</comment>
<question>4</question><question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elias chooses story over object ("An exchange, then"), foreclosing keeping brooch. Cost is visceral through weight metaphor; agency drives escalation under accumulative lens though conflict resolution borders on clean.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through amber/steel convergence and trapped fly—no moralizing. Final sketch reweights "haggard awe" without stating morals. "Fool's errand" line risks thematic echo but is early and not preachy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: painter notices "haggard awe" of sunrise, "chaotic calligraphy" of trails. Rhythmic control peaks in storm sequence ("furious, unseasonal downpour"). "Nutrient bar" slightly jars but doesn't break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops; "world washed clean of it" compresses backstory with momentum. Figurative language serves pressure ("thresh meaning... like farmer beating grain"). Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post-apocalyptic through painter's "haggard awe," not survival tropes. Amber/steel convergence transforms expected symbolism. Emotional specificity ("weary patience" of survivors) avoids genericness.</comment>
