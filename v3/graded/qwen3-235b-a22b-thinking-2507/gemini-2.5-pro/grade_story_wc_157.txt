<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation ("spark of defiance") and contradictory impulses (charm as shield/daggers) earned the climax choice. Slight emotional flatness in final action under peak stress prevents 9+ despite strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Flawless causal closure: "a moment to think, to plan, to *be*" makes conceptual cost undeniable. Orientation anchored by line 1; lens consistent from wilting sunflower to silence payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gourd seed functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image ("pushed the seed... silence"). Slight visual over-reliance in high-pressure greenhouse scene prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Kaelen's agency ("stop whispering/start screaming") forecloses options with trade-off cost ("wipe consciousness" vs. "moment to *be*"). Stakes feel slightly abstract despite conceptual clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: sunflower as "period," floral syntax, final "rebellious thought." Ending reweights "damp earth" opening into "blissful, temporary dark" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("thoughts... boiled cabbage"; seed's "smooth shell"). Minor cliché ("feverish intensity") under stress prevents 9+, but compression during crisis maintains voice integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "psychic network... buckled" has microscopic metaphor tension but no closure impact. High-pressure beats ("air thickened... light bend") avoid figurative muddle while propelling action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: thought taxation via Synaptic Census, resistance through gardening. "Chronophage fungus" spliced seed transforms tropes through specific, grounded stakes and emotional truth.</comment>
