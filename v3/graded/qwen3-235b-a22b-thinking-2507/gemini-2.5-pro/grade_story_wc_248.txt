<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "rage coiled" vs "intuitive part stilled it"; final brush-reach choice earned by prior trail discoveries. No stock phrasing—"tenderness threatening to crack ribs" embodies flaw-driven motivation without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost: "volcanic heat cooling into resolve as hard as diamond" crystallizes the shift from destruction to creation. Causal lens holds perfectly—tapestry alignment directly triggers the revelation, foreclosing fire as an option.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Archive basalt walls and pressure-plate mosaic actively constrain choices; tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting when held to light, charging the final image. Sensory specificity ("scent of petrified paper") avoids white-room syndrome while serving thematic pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs erasure) tighten when vandalism becomes part of the art, forcing Kaelen’s agency shift. Cost is unmistakable: "profound calm settled" reveals the volcanic heat’s transformation into diamond resolve, earned through his analytical intuition under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—torch to brush—not abstraction. Final image ("tenderness... bedrock of his art") reweights "volcanic tenderness" into enduring creation, avoiding moralizing while resonating with the vandalized portrait’s revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "mind, a strange marriage of analytically intuitive"; rhythmic control escalates during the light projection beat. Purposeful compression ("five years since going off the grid") taught early and paid off in the chamber’s visceral payoff.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops—every sentence propels momentum (e.g., "quiet detonation in his chest" compresses emotional weight). Peak-beat clarity in "chemical... shimmered revealing lines," with final line’s "enduring fire" crystallizing theme without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist becoming curator through art restoration. Transforms "vandalized self-portrait" trope by making erasure part of the masterpiece. "Volcanic tenderness" avoids cliché via specific, earned emotional modulation.</comment>
