<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian's embodied contradictions shine: frustration coiling "like roots," fist tightening around useless tools. Micro-choices (bypassing mending stones for ribbon) reveal hierarchy of values. Slight deduction as Lyra's off-page presence limits relationship crucible despite potent memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "knocking air from his chest" during ribbon discovery, then leaving it as "small blue prayer." Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory decay (sickly hum → vital thrum) with seed insertion as decisive reconfiguration. Zero orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The cathedral/orchard micro-setting actively constrains choices: Elian clings while roots twist "like second architecture," forcing tool abandonment. Ribbon's silk texture charges the final image—wrapping crystal as "splint" directly alters tactics and closure. No generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through knowledge shift: fracture transforms from "wound" to "germination space" via seed insertion. Cost is legible in physical reactions ("air knocked from chest") and irreversible action (leaving ribbon). Dominant stake (mending vs. allowing change) signaled by paragraph 2.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "deciduous vows" reframed as seed insertion, not stated. Final image—"vows that knew how to heal"—resonates without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; Lyra's off-page argument gains weight through Elian's embodied realization, not abstract philosophy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is masterful: quartz-eye filters light/stress fractures, scents anchor urgency ("apple blossoms and damp stone"). Minor deduction for "wave of accidental wisdom" (slight register drift). Single POV consistency flawless—no head-hopping, even in memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; "discordant hum softened, shifting into vital thrum" shows rhythmic propulsion. Only hairline flaw: "endearingly feisty" slightly disrupts voice in reflection. Final line—"small blue prayer tied around the future"—achieves textural specificity without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "wise elder" trope through concrete fusion: quartz-eye mender, apple seed in crystal. Cathedral/orchard setting avoids derivative fantasy; specificity ("polished apple seed... child's solemnity") grounds emotional truth. Risks lyrical closure without gimmickry.</comment>
