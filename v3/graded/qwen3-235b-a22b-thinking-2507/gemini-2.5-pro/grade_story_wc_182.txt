<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scholar/savior) act simultaneously; final choice earned through botanical detective work with visceral cost ("frantic beat of her heart"). Slight abstraction in initial motivation shift prevents 9.5+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("weight of all possible futures") under Situational lens. Pressure coherently forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving conflict. Kael's backstory risks causality gap but scope-appropriate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Botanical diary functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (decoding gaps) and charges final image (clutched during descent). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—calm catalog research vs. silent rock climax—without generic placeholder details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency (research → map → negotiation) under Situational lens. Stakes viscerally felt through "future burns" metaphor; cost unmistakable in final image's weight and symphony shift. No visible loss prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through symphony motif reweighted at closure ("hopeful crescendo"), avoiding moralizing. Near-miss with "seed that never sprouts" phrasing bordering on thematic echo but saved by character-particular voice. No stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("detective hunting a ghost through negative space") with rhythmic control shifting from lyrical research to taut negotiation. Syntax mirrors scholarly precision under stress; zero register drift despite academic terms like "equation of risk".</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "whispering moss" metaphor causally integrated not decorative. Peak beats crystalline ("wall of seamless living rock... absolute silence") with no figurative muddle. Final image avoids sentimentality through concrete action ("first step down").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical cryptography with linguistic quest avoids trope recycling. Emotional specificity in scholar's crisis elevates familiar "forbidden library" premise. Risk-taking (flora as Rosetta Stone) heightens stakes without gimmickry but lacks transcendent insight for 9.0.</comment>
