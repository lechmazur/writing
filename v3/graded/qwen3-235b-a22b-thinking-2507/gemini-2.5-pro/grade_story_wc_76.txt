<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act in scene ("bleak exhilaration" vs "terrifying potential"); visible cost in "scarred knuckles softening" and life's lines fading during reversal. Final choice earned by years of work with tangible physical consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: "lines of his life fading" and "weight of every choice lifted" crystallize the erasure stakes. Accumulative lens holds through tidal rhythm to machine activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hunger stone and yoyo mechanism function as micro-setting that charges the closure: "pulsing violet light" during reversal directly ties tool to conceptual cost. "Slick black rocks like leviathan bones" mirrors internal dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Agency in lever pull forecloses normal existence; cost visible in bodily dissolution ("knuckles softening"). Tide recession tightens temporal pressure, narrowing options to irreversible action under Accumulative escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Final image reweights "latent radiance" as terrifying unwritten potential without moralizing. "Ghost of what-could-have-been" transforms from sought energy to conceptual cost in the void, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct ("ozone and cold brass" scent cultivated like timepieces); rhythmic compression under pressure ("no sound... only profound thrum") maintains voice integrity during climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; "slick black rocks like forgotten leviathan bones" shows textural specificity. Minor abstraction in "cold fire" redeemed by embodied progression toward "dizzying lightness" in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of backward mechanics and hunger stone avoids time-travel clichés. "Bleak exhilaration" embodies emotional specificity; final reconfiguration grows organically from yoyo's temporal loop premise.</comment>
