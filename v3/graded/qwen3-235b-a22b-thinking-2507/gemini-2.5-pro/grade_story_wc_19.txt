<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (walls breathe vs. sky hunger) drives micro-choices like doll handling; embodied panic ("lungs seized") avoids labels. Final renunciation of shelter-phobia earns via ascent struggle, though secondary pressure absent limits full 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: doll on shelf as "precipice" reconfigures confinement with felt cost ("gilded hush... tinny and weak"). Accumulative lens holds—silence density intensifies ascent, reweights descent. Cost proof: "lungs filling completely" charges final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trellis mist’s "emotional weight" and porcelain doll constrain choices (doll’s shift from captive to pilgrim) while charging closure. Sensory specificity ("ozone and nascent starlight") filters through Elian’s silence-hunger, avoiding white-room syndrome despite minimal setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (suffocation vs. infinite safety) tightens via gravity inversion’s time pressure. Agency-driven escalation: Elian’s ascent battle ("contracted muscles fighting instinct") narrows options to endure openness, with cost legible in descent’s "shield of perspective." Single deepening sufficient at length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through silence motif’s evolution: "gilded hush" → "resonant quiet," with final image rejecting binaries. No moralizing; "pilgrim" doll reweights confinement without stating theme. CR closure reconfigures "safety" via concrete stakes (body vs. horizon).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("flavors of different silences," "tasted of ozone") reflects Elian’s obsession. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during ascent ("swimmer leaving an island of peace") modulate intensity. No POV drift, though lexicon occasionally edges toward ornate in calm beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High density with dual-purpose lines ("silence that did not press but expanded") but minor scaffold in opening ("unintended result was..."). Near-duplicate phrasing ("crisp and clean"/"vast, ancient") in silence descriptions. No closure artifacts; final line’s "horizon within" crystallizes momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia via gravity inversion and "xenial trellis" transforms tropes. Risk-taking (silence as flavor/taste) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Gilded hush" specificity avoids generic confinement; emotional truth in doll’s pilgrimage reconfiguration feels inevitable.</comment>
