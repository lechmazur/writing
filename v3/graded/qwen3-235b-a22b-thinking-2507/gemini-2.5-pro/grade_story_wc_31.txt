<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("This wasn't about grief; it was about physics") and embodied emotion (worn brass tag, muscles still in library) power the pilgrimage. Micro-choice to switch off light reveals devotion hierarchy with cost: surrendering safety for sensory truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "the color of a promise kept" crystallizes options (grief/devotion) through indigo vision. Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via sensory deprivation in library, reweighting the vow with felt absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rebreather gauges and water pressure constrain choices; the library’s "suspended world" charges closure. Sensory specificity ("swollen books drifted like sleeping bats") mirrors internal state without cliché, evolving with descent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling luminous vow) tightens when Silas switches off his light—a high-stakes renunciation of safety. Cost is legible in "exhausted and calm" post-dive; the calm itself embodies the earned trade-off of confronting grief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through indigo vision as non-literal answer: sound’s color is devotion’s hue, not scientific discovery. Avoids moralizing; "not empty" reweights ten years of absence through sensory resonance, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid night," "meteor hush") modulates with depth. Rhythmic control under pressure: short sentences during descent ("Down he went") contrast library’s suspended cadence. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via lantern imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One paraphrase loop: "profound meteor hush that filled his ears. The world above... vanished." Otherwise flawless propulsion—every line advances atmosphere or interiority. Final image ("not empty") avoids overwriting while charging closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms shipwreck trope through synesthetic vow and library setting. Emotional specificity in "indigo, like the moment just before the first star" avoids generic grief. Risk-taking (sensory deprivation dive) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
