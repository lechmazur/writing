<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in grief's duality ("drowning sea" to "current"), but "luminous torment" risks abstraction without enough embodied specificity in peak memory waves. Micro-choices like gem polishing as "abrasive prayer" ground the transformation credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("grief was no longer a drowning sea"), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where memory waves intensify pressure. Every beat tightens the emotional density without causality breaks, fulfilling the "one meaningful deepening" requirement perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: gem dust as "powdered starlight" and bamboo skeletons constrain choices while charging the final crane image. Tea garden's evolution from "hollowed-out reflection" to neutral space proves environment shapes emotional stakes decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens—each memory wave narrows Kaelen's options through sensory overload—drives agency to the gem-polishing climax. Cost is unmistakable in "knuckles white" during ascent and the dream's "achingly beautiful" broken promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: origami cranes' failure gives way to gem polishing, culminating in the crane's folded wings as earned wisdom. Final image reweights grief without moralizing, avoiding all anti-patterns like thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in phrases like "method a slow, abrasive prayer," with rhythm modulating under stress (shorter clauses during memory waves). Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored to Kaelen's tactile reality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level propulsion shines ("dust like powdered starlight"), but "luminous torment" appears twice with minimal variation, risking slight scaffold. Final line achieves perfect resonance without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tropes via mnemonic gems and shadow detachment, where "descends while ascending" physics transforms pilgrimage clichés. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
