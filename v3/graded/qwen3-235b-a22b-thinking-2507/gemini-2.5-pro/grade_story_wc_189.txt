<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via tidal-pool methodology applied to grief; embodied emotion in cicada-stroking and snail observation avoids therapy-speak. Kael’s underdevelopment slightly weakens relationship crucible despite strong single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "time changes its song" crystallizes reconfiguration with conceptual cost (loss of proximity). Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors (grotto/starlight) established by word 40.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its "threshold" nature directly charges the final image. Tidal pools and snail aren’t decorative; they’re tactical tools Elara uses to process grief, altering her stance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Elara’s observational agency: watching the snail becomes the pivotal micro-choice that forecloses denial. Cost is unmistakable—"cracking of the shell before flight" embodies conceptual sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from cicada/snail motifs without moralizing. Final line reweights "transition" as conceptual repricing, avoiding binaries while making the cost felt through salt-wind imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct (scientist’s selective attention), but minor register drift occurs in reflection block ("texture of time" borders on abstraction). Voice modulates beautifully under pressure otherwise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Near-flawless rhythm and specificity, though "fossilized leaves/starlight" sentence slightly overwrites. Zero loops; every line advances atmosphere or interiority without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of scientific observation with grief processing feels inevitable. Avoids tropes by grounding "transition" in tidal-pool biology—yet cicada motif edges toward familiarity without full transformation.</comment>
