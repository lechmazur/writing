<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "psychic hailstorm" to "clear lens" shift; embodied cost in smoothed invitation avoids therapy-speak. Flaw: empathy transformation resolves slightly too neatly for high 8s despite visible solitude cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly—smoothing the invitation crystallizes "shelter needn't be empty" with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density to the celestial map epiphany; cost proof in crease-smoothing gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library as active constraint: vellum scent enables "staying while leaving," celestial maps charge the final image. Micro-setting (invitation's creases) evolves meaningfully—environment directly shapes tactics and closure resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elara's sorrow reframes Elias's fear; cost of continued solitude is visible in his silent departure. Agency slightly diluted by external catalyst (her arrival), though his observation choice drives the insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "nested paradoxes" made concrete—solitude as connection in the star-mapped tranquility. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing; avoids false balance by honoring his genuine flaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "psychic hailstorm" and filigree-tracing reveal his empathetic lens. Minor register drift in "enlarged tranquility" slightly jars, but rhythm modulates beautifully under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "crumpled invitation" motif evolves with high density. "Washed over" cliché in climax costs 0.1—redundant phrasing where concrete action ("thumb smoothing creases") already charged the moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Secret library trope transformed through laundromat facade and celestial cartography; emotional specificity in empathy-as-burden avoids generic templates. Risks quiet ending that pays off through earned coherence.</comment>
