<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied obsession (daily whistle practice, chart transcriptions) but "sunwashed dread" borders on label; contradictory impulses (drive vs. dread) crystallize credibly in the final choice to make them believe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands perfectly: the map reweights watchers from gods to lighthouses with undeniable cost ("slow, ordained extinction"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern density tightens pressure to the final note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Turtle-city micro-setting actively constrains choices (isolation drives obsession); reed whistle’s crack charges the ending, but "pale, hazy shimmer" sun lacks tangible pressure on action despite vivid phrasing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deciphering the warning) escalates through Kaelen’s pattern realizations; agency-driven deepening (translating light to sound) forecloses hope with visceral cost in the crystallized "ordained extinction" certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of misinterpreted warnings emerges organically through concrete details (charts as visual music, gate sealed against them); final map image delivers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in pattern-obsessed noticing ("rhythmic groan of turtle shells"), but "dread was a physical thing" slightly veers toward label; rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion overall, but paraphrase loop in "dread was a physical thing now, a sun-baked certainty" dilutes momentum; no figurative muddle, yet minor redundancy prevents higher band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of city-on-turtles trope with communication-as-patterns; "lighthouses not gods" twist feels inevitable through specific, grounded details (mother’s logs, sonic syntax).</comment>
