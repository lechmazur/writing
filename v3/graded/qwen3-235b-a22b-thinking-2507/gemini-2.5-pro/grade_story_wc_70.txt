<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's contradictory impulses (truth compulsion vs. preserving wonder) drive his pivotal choice to offer the riddle instead of facts. Lena's embodied exhaustion-to-intent shift via "brow furrowed" reading avoids label-speak. Final renunciation of sterile transactions earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: Lena's transformation crystallizes options (pragmatism vs. rediscovered wonder) with conceptual cost in "the routine had become a tomb." Cost proof evident in final line's "preserved a little wonder" amid the city's emotional atrophy. Accumulative lens holds firm from riddle delivery to arcing lightning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lacquer box and tower constrain choices and charge closure: box enables Lena's realization, tower's "sun-spun glass" function mirrors the riddle. Pollen/ozone air and matchbox's "rattling" tactile detail filter through Silas's anti-sterility bias, culminating in the final image of managed lightning arcing against purple sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring vibrancy vs. sterile pragmatism) tightens through Silas's agency: refusing data for poetry forces Lena's deepening realization. Conceptual cost—"routine became a tomb"—is undeniable in the bio-mechanical revelation. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens via riddle's escalating density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: drone-bees needing "art, music, chaotic wonder" avoids abstraction. Final image ("planted like a seed") offers non-literal answer to "how to feel again" without moralizing. "Cold routine" line reweights premise with conceptual cost, rejecting tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "syrupy nectar dusk" and "hollowed out city's soul." Rhythm modulates from lyrical description to stark "No." Dialogue carries subtext ("What's that?" masking truth-seeking). Minor register drift in "bio-mechanical life" slightly jars but serves Lena's expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("syrupy, nectar dusk painted anxious faces"). Final line's rhythmic resolution ("preserved a little wonder, and for now, that was enough") charges closure. One borderline artifact: "bio-mechanical life" slightly technical but offset by poetic riddle. No closure-dulling muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms "truth-teller" trope via involuntary honesty strategically subverted. Drone-bees as "sun-spun glass" creatures needing emotional nourishment offers fresh inflection. Every detail serves premise (pollen/ozone air shows what drones harvested). Risk-taking (poetic closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
