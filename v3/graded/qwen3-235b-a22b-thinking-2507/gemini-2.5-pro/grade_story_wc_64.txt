<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shows contradictory impulses ("frantic hope" vs "crushing weight") through embodied actions like separating the silver thread. Motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" intensifies organically to the map revelation without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the sovereign case's pulse and final shelf placement crystallize stakes with conceptual cost ("a journey never completed"). Accumulative lens holds through tapestry decoding pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo's "velveteen gloom" evolves from shroud to "cherished blanket," actively constraining Elias' decoding work and charging the final image where stars are held "with tenderness" against the metal skin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Decoding pressure tightens through Elias' agency ("surge of frantic hope" to map discovery), narrowing options via the silver thread. Cost is legible in "crushing weight of a journey never completed" under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "frayed edges" becoming "testament to hope" reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image answers the central question through the sovereign case's silent peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("tune softer than falling dust," "velveteen gloom") with rhythmic control. Elision of backstory taught early via sovereign case discovery, paying off in the closure's "story finally heard."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "pulled crimson strand" and "knots and loose ends" create high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("birdsong after a storm") earns its place through accumulation without muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms cemetery trope through specific synthesis: sovereign case as "empty vessel waiting to be filled" feels inevitable. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
