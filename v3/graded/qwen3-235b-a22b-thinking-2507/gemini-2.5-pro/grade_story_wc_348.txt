<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (scientist vs. father) manifest physically in "tight, hard knot" evolving to unspooled fibers; micro-choice of touching chrysalis earns closure with visible cost. Epiphany avoids diagnostic language by rooting insight in river foam observation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "knot of grief... loosened" reconfigures divergence with undeniable cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—river foam density increase narrows options from atonement to celebration. Orientation anchors immediately in wet stone/pollen sensory mix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Braided ravine constrains every choice: river foam observation on granite slab directly enables insight. Final "cathedral" image charges setting with earned cost—walls shift from "prison of regret" to sacred space through character action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating separation into connection) tightens via river foam deepening: protagonist's agency transforms "desperate need" into "celebration" with visceral grief-to-hope cost. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through river/chrysalis motifs without moralizing; final line reweights "divergent path" as beauty. Avoids thematic echo by having Lena's "cathedral" callback earn resonance through tactile realization, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: chemist sees "enzymatic breakdown" then "polymerization in real time." Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from fragmented grief ("raw in this place") to flowing epiphany ("slow, widening dawn"). Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "lightness a profound weight" crystallizes insight with high density. Minor deduction for "symphonically minded" tell-y phrasing in otherwise show-don't-tell mastery. Final line’s "river that held them both" recharges motifs without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope through scientific lens: polymer/river foam parallel feels organic, not checklist. Risk-taking in gradual epiphany ("slow, widening dawn") heightens authenticity without obscuring closure charge.</comment>
