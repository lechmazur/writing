<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "nervous beat" vs "steady hand" during vial uncapping; embodied motivation ("rhythm of repair") drives gear insertion with visible cost in dissolving timelines. Slight underdevelopment of flaw-driven struggle caps high-band entry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: dissolving timelines and persistent "driftwood nostalgia" prove cost, while causal chain (prophecy→shadow→keyhole) holds without lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint of fractured reflections shapes final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen Orrery actively constrains choice (blinding glare forcing shadow solution) and charges closure via "shed skin" frost; gear warmth against frigid air demonstrates micro-setting pressure. Final golden light reweights opening "hauntingly bright" glare with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Orrery repair) tightens through Elara's agency: shadow creation narrows options to one decisive gear insertion. Cost crystallizes in "shed skin" frost and dissolving timelines—visceral, felt, and directly tied to resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "rhythm of repair" reweights from obsession to "quiet harmony" via moving gears, avoiding moralizing. Final image answers central question by merging nostalgia with earned purpose—no thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water-smoothed wood" ache, light "drinking" void) sustains under pressure; rhythmic control peaks in vial uncapping sequence. No head-hopping; compression taught early via "hall of mirrors" reflection mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops in climax; "hauntingly bright" reframes meaning across beats without figurative muddle. Minor synonym churn ("brittle fragments she collected, piecing together") in opening avoids closure impact. Propulsion flawless during gear insertion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Lunar-eclipse locksmith" transforms trope through causal necessity—only shadow solves glare—and feels inevitable. Risk-taking (liquid eclipse essence) heightens stakes coherently; specificity ("scalloped gear teeth") avoids abstraction.</comment>
