<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in embodied fear vs. adaptive resolve, but "proving vulnerability is power" motivation lacks contradictory impulses in choices; diagnostic phrasing slightly undermines climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Julian's shattered plan and Leo's trembling certainty reconfigure options with undeniable conceptual cost ("pierced by a ghost"). Causal lens holds flawlessly from betrayal to failsafe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Library setting actively constrains choices (height advantage, starlight cipher) and charges closure; the child's cast evolves from emotional artifact to tactical key with irreversible specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven purely by Leo's agency under causal lens—decrypting cast directly triggers failsafe—but vulnerability motivation isn't dramatized through conflicting choices during pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("trembling with violent certainty") delivers non-literal answer to identity theme without moralizing; shell's silence reweights vulnerability as power through concrete action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("familiar spike of acrophobia," "spray of distant stars") shines, but stress diction remains overly articulate ("earthquake in my soul") during high-pressure decryption.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density in decryption beat. Minor cadence rigidity ("I began... I looked up... I began") prevents 9.0 despite crystalline closure imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of identity-reveal trope via stuntman specificity (adaptive = core trait) and cast cipher, but "ghost he had programmed" echoes Blade Runner slightly.</comment>
