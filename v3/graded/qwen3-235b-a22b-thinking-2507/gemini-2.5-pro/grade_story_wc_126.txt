<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (rebellion vs reverence for silence) drive her micro-choice to play "an offering," not shatter the hush. Near-tell in "quiet rebellion" slightly dilutes embodied motivation during pivotal bow raise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "arms ached and heart full" as the resonant drop hits the bowl. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly—density peaks when shipwrecks "coax a sigh" from low thrums.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains every choice: shipwrecks buffer wind for acoustic precision, pear skeletons vibrate with melodies. Final drop’s impact charges the closure image by transforming the mendicant’s bowl from empty vessel to symphony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (can beauty exist in silence?) tightens via agency: her arpeggio "waking something" forces stance crystallization. Cost—physical exhaustion and emotional completion—is visible when "last note faded" amid resonant silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "unfinished song" reweights as "completion" via the bowl’s drop. Avoids moralizing; final image answers the central question without abstraction. Near-tell in "magnificent simplicity" slightly mars earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "horsehair tasting saline air," "phantom memory of blossoms." Rhythmic control peaks during musical dialogue ("low thrum...coax a sigh"). Slight register drift in "quiet rebellion" at climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; lines do triple duty ("webbed with rust-colored skeletons" establishes setting/emotion/theme). Final drop’s propulsion is flawless. Minor density dip in "magnificent simplicity" phrase, but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse tropes via acoustic lens: shipwrecks as sound bodies feels inevitable. Risk-taking (quiet climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry. "Echo-harbor" synthesis is fresh, specific, and emotionally complex.</comment>
