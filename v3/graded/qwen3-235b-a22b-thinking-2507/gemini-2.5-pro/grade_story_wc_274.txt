<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "bravely conflicted" physicalized through trembling hands versus "automaton’s purpose," but "schism running through core of vows" veers into diagnostic label-speak (-0.5 penalty). Motivation rooted in professional disillusionment earns credibility through specific archival actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the "dizzying quiet" reweighted by "weight of what was to come" crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation to the keystroke climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Snow transforms from sanctuary ("dizzying quiet") to narrative constraint enabling isolation, while the pre-Unification terminal’s physicality ("plastic chair creaking") charges the final image. Micro-setting actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (truth vs stability) tightens through Elara’s agency alone; the "pang of betrayal" and altered quiet provide visible cost. Pressure accumulates via sensory narrowing under Accumulative lens without requiring external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the letter’s "contraband truths" reframed by "living deserved truth more than dead deserved secrets." Final snow image ("blank page unaware of story") delivers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in archival lexicon ("data-fane," "cryo-pumps") and stress-induced compression ("body moved with automaton’s purpose"). Rhythmic control peaks in the terminal sequence with taught patterned elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; "cascading data-packet" demonstrates high information density without figurative muddle. Strategic telling ("thawed for centennial audit") compresses backstory while "frost-rimmed vaults" anchors setting through action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival sci-fi tropes through specific moral calculus ("scandalize into paralysis"). Risk-taking in Accumulative structure heightens stakes, though premise slightly echoes familiar dystopian templates without full transformation.</comment>
