<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in rejecting Hemlock's shouts for "screaming tenderness"—embodied as "threatened to tear him apart"—avoiding therapy-speak. Micro-choice of pressing cork to lens reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "frantic, hopeful beating of his heart" during the wait crystallizes stakes. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—fog parts via scent accumulation, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cobalt lens functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (conduit for intent) and charges the final image (sunrise on sea). Vial cork's tactile specificity—"porous vial cork"—alters tactics under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single deepening (Hemlock's failed shouting vs. Elias's whisper) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is visceral in the "eternity of focused silence" and the ship's sudden, scent-guided arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the jasmine thread—"fragrant, invisible thread weaving through fog"—without moralizing. Final image reweights "whispers travel farther" as lived truth, avoiding Thematic Echo via captain's garden reference.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in "air like a held breath released"; rhythm modulates from languid dawn to staccato focus ("He began to beckon"). Hemlock's snoring shows contrast without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops—every sentence propels: "a fragrant, invisible thread" avoids cliché. Final line ("quiet, unstoppable force of a whisper") crystallizes theme without abstraction. "Screaming tenderness" saved by immediate embodiment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms lighthouse trope via sensory specificity (vial cork, jasmine). "Vibrations of intent" feels inevitable, not magical—rooted in Elias's garden memory and physical focus under pressure.</comment>
