<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when academic caution shatters against visceral memory—embodied in the trembling claw-hand maneuver. Flaw: slight underdevelopment of his chronic curiosity's self-destructive edge pre-choice weakens the final tradeoff's inevitability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the "ache both hollow and full" crystallizes irreversible cost, reconfiguring his life's work from observation to pursuit. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—fractured constellations tightening pressure without causal loopholes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sunken greenhouse isn't backdrop but active constraint: algae-kissed panes warp constellations into a "celestial cipher," directly shaping his detection method. Shipwrecks as "jagged corona" mirror his fractured psyche, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory recovery) tightens through one decisive act: touching the mushroom. The cost—"hollow and full" ache—alters tactics visibly as he shifts from observer to seeker. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens via sensory density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the key, not the kingdom: "it hadn't returned his life; it had given him a key" crystallizes earned wisdom about partial recovery. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is pristine: "calloused hands and pressure gauge" frames folklore through tactile science. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks when "spidery scrawl" of Polaris mirrors his unraveling. Zero head-hopping; lexicon stays within his diver-scholar voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence advances story: "mechanical arms unfolding like a praying mantis" merges action and metaphor. Final line’s "work was finally beginning" recharges the opening logbook with propulsion. Near-purple prose ("ghostly green tableau") stays voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms tropes via specificity: folklorist as diver using broken constellations to detect Fae signatures. Emotional truth in "crisp nostalgia" avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (scientific magic system) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
