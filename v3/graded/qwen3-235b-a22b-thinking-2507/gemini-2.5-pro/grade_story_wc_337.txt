<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Master's embodied emotion during knot-unraveling ("breath held, pouring calm into needle tip") shows contradictory impulses (calm professional vs exhausted human). Kaelen's trembling hand accepting the needle reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak; fear manifests as "fragile dam against tide."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is strong Charged Poise: Kaelen taking the needle forecloses innocence with legible cost ("trembling hand," "weight resting fully on shoulders"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—each unraveled knot accumulates silence while straining the net. Orientation crystal-clear by line 3 with "crystalline chamber" and starlight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary isn't backdrop—the starlight's "frantic" quality mirrors emotional state, and the net's physical properties ("gnarled cluster," "hempen cords") directly constrain choices. Tapestry needle's "bone-cool surface" charges the final image. Micro-setting fully qualifies as environment constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (net integrity = world stability) signaled immediately via "lucid unrest." Escalation is pure Accumulative: sailor's knot release both eases pressure while highlighting thousands more. Cost visible in master's "familiar exhaustion" and Kaelen's pale understanding. Agency-driven—choices directly alter the net's state with felt consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "interlaced hush" reweights at closure when Kaelen takes the needle, showing silence as active maintenance, not absence. Final image of trembling hand offers resonant answer to "how to hold chaos" without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo through concrete particulars ("scent of briny deep" absorbing rage).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: master notices "prickling anxiety that clung to skin" and "scent of briny deep." Rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure—short phrases during knot-unraveling ("It did not snap... but simply relaxed") mirror tension. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during high-stress moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence pulls double duty ("starlight shattered into trembling shards" establishes setting while mirroring anxiety). No figurative muddle in peak beats—the sailor's release uses concrete sensory details. Final line's "bone-cool surface... stark reality" delivers perfect closure charge without a single redundant word.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms "ghost story" trope through specific premise—spirits as frayed knots in a net that "accumulates silence." Fresh inflection: "exhuming stories" via knot-unraveling feels inevitable. Avoids derivative pitfalls by grounding supernatural in tangible craft (mask restoration parallel); emotional specificity elevates beyond surface novelty.</comment>
