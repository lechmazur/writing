<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (seeking pain vs. needing healing) manifest in micro-choices like unsealing jars; closure renunciation earned through cellular "mending" cost. Avoids diagnostic label-speak via embodied synesthesia ("teeth ache" during aurora). Slight over-tidiness in final insight caps score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "cells would continue to divide, but now... begin to mend" crystallizes biological stakes. Accumulative lens holds through absence-pouring sequence. Orientation flawless by word 30; cost proof undeniable in final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Shipwrecks evolve from decay symbols to survival monuments, charging closure image. Micro-setting (ashen forge's cold luminescence) directly constrains the climax. "Salt-streaked glass" and moss hum integrate with action, avoiding postcard syndrome. Exceptional sensory selectivity under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single tightening—pouring absences—narrows options decisively under Accumulative lens. Cost ("grinding glass and tearing silk") is unmistakable and shapes the cellular mending payoff. Agency pure: Elias's choices drive every escalation beat without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "battered marvel" reconfiguration: shipwrecks shift from disaster to survival in final image. Zero moralizing; insight earned via crystal's transformation. Avoids thematic echo by embedding wisdom in cellular biology ("cells... begin to mend").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "pearlescent shimmer... fleeting chime" filters world through synesthesia. Rhythmic control under climax ("grinding glass...") avoids overwriting. Compression taught early (para 2's sensory symphony) pays off in closure's quiet density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "skeletal masts clawing at a sky" does triple duty for atmosphere/motif/stakes. Peak-beat clarity in "grinding glass and tearing silk" avoids purple prose. Final line recharges cellular motif with irreversible cost—text-artifact free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms "hearing aid" trope via absence-collection mechanics. "Battered marvel" synthesis feels inevitable: shipwrecks → survival reconfiguration grows from greenhouse's defiance. Risk-taking (cold forge powered by voids) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
