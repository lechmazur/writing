<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction between deafness and symphonic mind manifests in tactile pressure choices; "filling the hollow space" crystallizes embodied cost without labels. Final renunciation of imposed melody earns closure through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "filling the hollow space the silence had carved"—a visceral image proving conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly as density builds toward the grove's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (density for vibration transfer) and charges the final image against the Old One's trunk. Sensory specificity elevates beyond visual clichés, though scent/taste could deepen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency: tracing stress cracks to strumming saplings reweights the dominant stake ("create music in silence") with felt cost in her chest. No coincidence—only deepening mastery forecloses imposed melody.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Final image ("the world was no longer quiet. It was listening") reweights silence as active presence without moralizing. Theme emerges from "releasing the one already captured by time," avoiding binaries about disability through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: silence as "texture without melody" reflects her deafness while rhythmic cadence mirrors strumming. One elevated phrase ("quiet ritual of empathy") fits her artistic POV without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion with textural specificity ("jagged line that documented a century of slow leaning"). Minor scaffold in "She was no longer just a sculptor; she was a conductor" prevents 9+ but doesn't dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms disability trope through "tree-song sculptor" specificity; emotional truth in using decay (stress cracks) as musical score. Risk-taking lyrical structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
