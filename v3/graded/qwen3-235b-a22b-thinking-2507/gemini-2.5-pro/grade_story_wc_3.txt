<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "motivation was no longer to simply cultivate... but to understand," with embodied grief in "dirt under her nails" during planting. Final choice earned through analogical thinking, though "still, deep well of sorrow" borders on stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the luminescent sprout reconfigures Kael's absence with conceptual cost ("distance remained, but no longer an ending"). Accumulative lens holds via humming arbor's deepening resonance, with cost legible in "softened into anticipation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor functions as micro-setting that charges closure—the semitone shift and filament pulse directly constrain choices and reweight the final image. "Silver-leafed vines" guided by field lines mirror memory's force, avoiding overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when planting the seed shifts theory to action, narrowing options to "inquiry" over mourning. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens, with cost crystallized in the sprout's physics-based answer replacing verbal resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through image: the "filament of pure, steady luminescence" reweights "haunted ambitions" without moralizing. Final line’s "vast, and ultimately logical, design" resonates as earned wisdom from concrete struggle, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in translator’s lens: "tracing cuneiform" shapes noticing ("syntax of transition"), with rhythmic control in "A life was not a candle flame... but a complex waveform." No head-hopping; compression taught early via arbor’s hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dense, like a collapsed star" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor deduction for "beautiful, hollow ghosts" verging on cliché, but propulsion remains relentless toward the luminous payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief trope via physics-of-transition premise, with magnetic arbor’s hum offering fresh emotional metric. Risk-taking in conceptual closure (sprout as cosmic syntax) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "Rosetta Stone" metaphor edges toward familiarity.</comment>
