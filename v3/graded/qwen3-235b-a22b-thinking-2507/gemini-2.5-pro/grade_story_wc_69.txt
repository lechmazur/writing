<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias' embodied resignation ("familiar, expectantly resigned sigh") and contradictory impulses (knowing work is "turning a tide with a teacup" yet persisting) drive credible micro-choices. Final humming scene earns change through prior causality—carving noise concept applied physically—without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "collective past momentarily carved away" crystallizes the Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure coheres through sensory accumulation (breathing merging into "single tide"), reconfiguring options with visceral stakes in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet library’s "traveled stillness" and rosette constrain choice—Elias’ epiphany emerges from tactile interaction with the object. Autumn decay outside mirrors community "slow, magnificent decay," charging the final humming with environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias’ agency: realizing "method was wrong" shifts tactics to subtraction. Cost is legible in "fragile calm" and "wavering yet whole" hum—resentments carved away with felt relational cost—but tightening lacks one visible tradeoff beyond emotional vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Final image ("textures in a single sound") offers resonant, non-literal answer to vanishing arts, reweighting the rosette’s "air that is not" as communal space. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in "imperfect, wavering, yet whole" harmony without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines ("scent of old paper and dry leaves a familiar comfort"), but tense shifts slightly during choir reflection. Voice modulates effectively under pressure—lyric cadence during breathing exercise deepens texture without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "shuffling feet and nervous coughs—the familiar noise" compresses tension. Minor density dip in "generations of animosity in their bones" risks overwriting, but final image’s specificity ("resonance in a quiet room") rescues momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "carving away noise" transforms choir conflict into tactile philosophy. Specific detail ("zither soundhole rosette salvaged from splintered instrument") avoids abstraction, while risk-taking (silence as climax) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
