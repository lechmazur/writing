<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied choices: needle mending blankets yet anchoring broken promise. "Quiet, persistent compassion" realization avoids thematic echo by tying to concrete actions (spare blanket, kind words), though "distill complexity" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: "knot... finally loosen, not by being undone, but by being understood." Fog-bound stasis crystallizes into motion under Accumulative lens; hammering cessation and bell tone reconfigure options with visceral emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fog-bound river crossing functions as micro-setting that charges closure: visibility = mental clarity. Needle’s tactile presence constrains choice (mending tool → memory anchor), while dripping/rain gutters create sensory hierarchy that mirrors Elias’s unraveling tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (broken promise as moral burden) tightens through sensory deepening: river sounds shift from "metallic heartbeat" to "immense silence," narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is felt in "knot... loosen," though one intensification limits escalation depth for 9.0+.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through needle’s transformation: from mending tool to symbol of "quiet, persistent compassion." Final image ("hands steady, mind serene") reweights promise without moralizing, making abstract duty visceral through spare blankets and kind words to passengers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: "soupy white fog" filtered through coachman’s ambient awareness. Rhythmic control peaks in river description ("rhythmic clank... slow, viscous breath"), compressing stress without voice slippage or filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Zero text artifacts; every sentence multiplies meaning. "Feeble holes in soupy white fog" blends texture and metaphor without overwriting. Final paragraph’s cadence shift ("rain gutters stopped ticking... immense silence") delivers propulsion through sparse, weighted phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of coachman archetype: "palimpsest promise" reframes regret as active compassion. Risk-taking in Accumulative structure pays off, though "spindrift serenity" slightly leans on poetic convention without full transformation.</comment>
