<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "soften edges" of self versus structured identity; embodied cost in shivering from "profound quietude" not cold. No diagnostic labels, but single-POV limits relationship crucible depth despite strong micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: colonnade shifts from "mystery" to "kindred spirit" with visible cost in identity dissolution ("porous, allowing... signal to seep in"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation to "tremor of certainty."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake constrain choice—silence demands surrender, lake becomes "blank page" charging final image. Vibrations as "tectonic shift into line break" proves environment shapes tactics, exceeding 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency: "dissolving boundaries" method narrows options from observation to irreversible identity shift. Cost crystallizes in "shivering... profound quietude," reweighting "chaotic frequency" into blueprint under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "paraphrase not translate" struggle; final image ("ink of new understanding") offers resonant answer without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by embedding insight in sensory work—"crystalline patterns of vibration" over abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "cloud-shadow poet" lexicon ("lantern-moth hush," "geological time and starlight"). Rhythmic control falters slightly in climax with repetitive "he felt... he began..." stems under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "polished stone" metaphor earns payoff through prior "crystalline patterns." Final line’s cadence ("weave that passage into poems") resolves propulsion without figurative muddle. Closure image pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transforms "forbidden place" trope through vibrational paraphrasing—emotional specificity in "dissolving boundaries" avoids abstraction. Risk-taking (lyric density) heightens stakes; "tremor of certainty" feels earned from quartz's "geological time" texture.</comment>
