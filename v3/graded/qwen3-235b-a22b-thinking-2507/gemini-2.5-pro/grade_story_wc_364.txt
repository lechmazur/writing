<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied memory sacrifices ("taste of sun-ripened plum"), but "quietly determined" trait leans slightly told rather than shown in pivotal action. Contradictory impulses (saving home vs. losing joy) drive closure with profound cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the arch's "quiet, defiant blue" crystallizes options with visceral cost (hollowed memories). Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies through memory offerings—but minor causality ambiguity in silk's mechanics slightly dulls escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Floating arches actively constrain choices (dust sours fruit), and the geode's "dull lattice" directly shapes the climax. Final blue-lit arch recharges the setting with undeniable thematic weight, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Elian's agency: offering sensory memories narrows options to a single, costly ritual. The "hollowed out" realization makes cost unmistakable, though the Accumulative escalation lacks one sharper intensification beat before the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through concrete action—bartering taste for planetary resilience—avoiding moralizing. The final "defiant blue" reweights "awakening" as fragile hope without stating a moral, perfectly fulfilling the Q5 9+ test.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in textured details ("silk felt like captured twilight"), but "bartered awakenings" momentarily drifts into academic diction. Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful, with elision (off-world magician's backstory) cleanly taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero scaffolding or loops; "calloused but careful" exemplifies layered concision. Final line’s propulsion ("descend again tomorrow") elevates closure, though "defiance in deathly silence" slightly overwrites the geode’s pulse moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of "bartered awakenings" via sensory memories avoids magic-system tropes. Emotional specificity (trading plum taste for resilience) transforms the familiar, with the blue-lit arch offering a fresh, inevitable payoff that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
