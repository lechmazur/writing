<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—hoarding the bread as "private sin" while planting seeds for future life—crystallize in the patrolman confrontation; her whispered history with Miller’s Bakery reveals embodied, character-specific grief without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the patrolman’s nod and departure reconfigures the courtyard from "derelict space" to "place of memory" with felt cost in the "tenuous absolution" of continuing her fragile work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The petrified bread heel and dirt under fingernails function as micro-setting that charges the final image; the mortar gaps where thyme seeds are pressed directly constrain her rebellion and reappear in the earned communion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the patrolman’s tired uniform forces Elara to "uncloak" her purpose; his whispered "My mother waited in line" narrows options to silent connection, making the cost of continued resistance palpable in the "fragile peace."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bread’s transformation—from fossilized sin to shared ghost—culminating in the final line’s "communion" with dirt, reweighting decay as sacred without moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in "moss ate the marble" and "cold bit deeper," compressing Elara’s worldview; under pressure, syntax tightens to stark fragments ("She felt a strange calm") without voice leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "a flicker of something, not quite understanding but a cousin to it" delivers layered subtext in high-pressure beat with rhythmic precision that propels momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms dystopian tropes through intimate focus—vanishing bakeries over bombs, guerrilla gardening as "heuristically gentle" rebellion—making the political deeply personal via flour-dusted windows and Saturday queues.</comment>
