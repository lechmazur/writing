<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "precious and painful object" and the numbness war, but audience reactions verge on symbolic convenience without deeper individualization beyond the weeping man and smiling woman.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "silence that felt different now" crystallizes reconfiguration with visible cost in the altered perception of seasons, under a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stone floor as micro-setting constrains choice (only bass vibrations work) and charges the final image—"resonant heart of the earth itself" ties setting to voice with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through vibration density toward the resonant thrumming; cost is unmistakable in the seasonal shift from "ending" to "hopeful intake," driven entirely by Elara's agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: "silence that felt different now" reweights numbness without moralizing, avoiding sentimentality through concrete sensation ("aching, beautiful space between them").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("sound was a physical presence, a tremor in the bones"), though "mournful peaks became deep, questioning valleys" slightly overwrites under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "the cavern was no longer empty or silent; it was full of this shared, tactile music" demonstrates high density without muddle even in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness and vibration as emotional language transforms tropes; risk-taking (no dialogue, sensory shift) heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3 distinction).</comment>
