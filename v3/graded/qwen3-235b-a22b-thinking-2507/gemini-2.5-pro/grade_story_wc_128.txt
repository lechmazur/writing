<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority shines via cargo-broker lens ("tallied tonnage," hands study) with embodied emotion (collar adjustment, locket touch), but relationship development slightly rushed; Alina’s silent joy lacks contradictory impulses at climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: envelope reveal forecloses Elias’s "cautious exuberance" with visible cost ("tears welled... transforming starlight"). Hybrid lens (causal dominance) holds; orientation anchored by word 40 ("rooftop terrace after final encore").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library setting constrains choice (plaque location tied to "overlooking concert hall") and charges final image (starlight→tears), but sea breeze/salty air lacks causal pressure beyond atmosphere; micro-setting (locket) compensates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stake (honoring silent contributors) tightens via Elias’s agency: his "emotional risk" calculation drives the envelope reveal. Cost legible in Alina’s stunned tears; single escalation suffices for length. David’s legacy deepens thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (dockworkers→David→grant), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "cycles" without stating it, though "cycles of compassion" phrasing edges toward thematic echo in climax beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through cargo-broker lens ("complex systems," "tallied tonnage"); dialogue distinct (Alina’s poetic "solace in swell," Elias’s precise "always is"). Rhythmic control under pressure flawless in reveal beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High density with minimal scaffold ("quiet accounts after loud beauty" slightly overwritten). No loops, but "humming just beneath shrewd composure" weakens propulsion; final image’s "starlight→tears" achieves textural precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "quiet contributors" via occupational specificity (second chair, dockworkers). Emotional truth in locket habit avoids sentimentality; avoids safety-middle with Elias’s shrewd calculation of emotional risk.</comment>
