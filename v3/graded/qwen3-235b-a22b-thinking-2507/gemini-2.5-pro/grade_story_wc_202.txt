<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses during climax; "intuition anchored and absolute" edges toward label-speak without embodied struggle. Micro-choices under pressure are minimal during the unfastening act despite strong motivation setup. Interiority remains consistent but misses the required simultaneous contradictory impulses for 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "lens fragment felt suddenly lighter" embodies conceptual cost of historical acknowledgment. Accumulative lens holds from midpoint ("deliberate errors were the keyhole") through closure’s "somber, corrected light." Orientation anchors by word 48 with vivid market details serving closure’s truth-revealing function.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens fragment as micro-setting constrains every choice and charges the final image through weight shift ("heavy" to "lighter"). Alchemist’s market provides atmospheric specificity but doesn’t pressure tactics beyond supplying the painting. Sensory details ("linseed oil and ozone") filtered through translator’s purpose avoid white-room syndrome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens via density increase: paint thinning to reveal truth creates one decisive deepening. Cost is legible in physical tension ("fingers tightened") and ghostly sigh, charging the final image. Agency remains protagonist-driven but lacks visible tactical adaptation beyond the singular unfastening act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shipwreck cover-up reweights "quiet truths" without moralizing. Final image of corrected seascape offers resonant answer to "overlooked histories" through somber light, avoiding abstraction. "Guilty sea" anthropomorphism slightly edges toward thematic echo but redeemed by earned closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines in "thick paint seemed to thin, becoming translucent" – translator’s sensory bias evident. Rhythmic control peaks in closure’s cadence shift ("long moment... mercifully come to end"). Minor register drift in "intuition anchored" but voice remains consistent under pressure with taught elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible, like smoke you could almost hold" creates slight metaphor friction but no closure damage. Zero loops/scaffold; propulsion peaks in unfastening sequence with clean syntax. Final line’s rhythmic cadence ("long moment... come to an end") delivers high-density closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms familiar truth-revealing trope through lens fragment’s physicality and market setting’s specificity. Emotional truth in "sailor’s ghost-thin hand" avoids generic templates. Derivative risk mitigated by fresh synthesis of historical erasure mechanics, though market concept lacks deeper transformation.</comment>
