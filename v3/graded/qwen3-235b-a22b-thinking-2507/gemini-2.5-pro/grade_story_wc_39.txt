<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through embodied action—"sweet sorrow of being sole witness" crystallizes isolation/connection tension; final seashell placement earns closure via prior causality with visible cost of transfigured purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "silence felt full and complete" reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost ("small existence justified"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory density escalation to the final grace note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dunes and loft actively constrain choices—porthole light guides jar arrangement, marram grass whispers become essential symphony components; final seashell charges setting by transforming "lonesome splendor" into connection conduit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "sweeten its profound silence" drives sound collection, narrowing options to a single symphonic solution; cost crystallizes in "fleeting, beautiful resonance" redefining his existence with felt conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges solely through particulars—no moralizing, only "translated its ghost into language of now" and seashell grace note offering non-literal resolution to memory/presence tension; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature thrives in "brittle tap-dance of desiccated crab legs" and "grey silk of morning sea"; rhythmic control shifts from lyrical dawn to staccato sound collection, teaching pattern early for payoff in symphonic cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops—every phrase multiplies meaning ("foghorn’s hum laid foundation of melancholy peace" does setting/emotion/theme); no figurative muddle even in peak symphony beat where density peaks with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-capturing as memory preservation avoids cliché; emotional specificity in "sandpiper's frantic heart beat" grounds universal theme, with risk-taking in quiet closure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
