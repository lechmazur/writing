<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lacks contradictory impulses in key beats; motivation to unify is clear but interior struggle under pressure is underdeveloped. Final choice earns closure but lacks the visceral micro-choices demanded for 9+ (e.g., hesitation before dropping dictionary).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Flawless Accumulative/Textural closure: "she stopped witnessing and simply became" crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost (erasure of self). Lens holds perfectly; cost proof evident in the dissolution image reconfiguring "arbitration" from conflict to unity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (dictionary) constrains choice and charges final image, but temple library remains atmospheric backdrop. Obsidian floor and spiral path lack causal pressure on tactics; environment anchors tone but doesn’t shape her journey’s critical moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stake (unifying with hush) tightens through embodied ritual; cost (loss of self) is visceral in the dissolution. Agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens—her walk narrows options toward inevitable unity with no loopholes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids moralizing while offering resonant answer: silence as "eternal syllable" reweights cosmic conflict as inherent unity. Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars (dictionary’s warped definition, falling book), never stated—perfect earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("resounding hush was the only scripture") with rhythmic control, but "plenum of resolution" drifts from librarian’s plausible lexicon. Minor register slip prevents 9+; otherwise masterful voice modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; only "echo of every word... settled into profound silence" slightly loops with "resounding hush" description. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; every sentence advances density with crystalline rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms cosmic resolution tropes via "spiral arbitration" mechanics and dictionary artifact. Specific synthesis (softcover book as cosmic key) feels inevitable; risk in making silence the goal heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
