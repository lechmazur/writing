<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority rooted in concrete action: Kael's "strangely honest" trait manifests when correcting the disciple ("not a club to beat the world"), avoiding label-only embodiment. Minor deduction for underdeveloped internal contradiction beyond preservation drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "it no longer mattered" crystallizes irreversible cost of sealing the dune. Orientation clear by line 3 ("murmuring pavilion"), lens (Accumulative/Textural) held consistently through psychic ritual mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dunes actively constrain choice: sand's "soft drag" shapes Kael's gait, while the kinetic parapet's obsidian lenses literally charge the final image ("silent clearing beneath the sand"). Micro-setting qualifies by defining the ritual's physical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kael's agency: disciple's distortion catalyzes departure, dune descent tightens options toward consecration. Cost legible in "leaving no trace"—sacrificing presence for truth's purity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: "conjured clearings" reweight wisdom preservation without moralizing. Final line ("fragile truth... pure and inviolate") offers resonant CR by contrasting "murmuring pavilion" with sealed silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "slight curve in straightest lines of logic" reveals Kael's bias. Rhythmic control peaks in ritual sequence ("sand began to shiver... hissed and retracted"), though "whisperfield calm" slightly drifts into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; propulsion via textural density ("loom of sound, weaving whispers into tapestry of doubt"). Minor deduction: "resonant thrum" borders cliché, but final line's specificity ("hues of orange and violet... silent clearing") crystallizes closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms "truth preservation" trope through kinetic parapet mechanics. Risk-taking (psychic ritual as closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry—environment and constraint shape every choice, making the echo's purity inevitable.</comment>
