<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses in pivotal moments; climax choice feels abrupt without prior micro-choices showing hierarchy of values. "Panic seized him" lacks embodied specificity compared to earlier ozone-tasting sorrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost via sun's gold breaking blue gloom, but cost proof is oblique—no exact sentence pinpoints sacrifice. Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds, though map's chest opening edges toward convenient resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico actively constrains choices (refracting star map) and charges final image with visceral color shift from blue to gold. Storm pressure directly alters tactics—lightning clawing portico forces map discovery—fulfilling 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten coherently under Hybrid lens: Great Storm forces stance crystallization between shadow prophecies. Cost is felt (end of blue world) but not visibly paid; sun's appearance shows success without clear forfeiture beyond abstract "weight of nascent world."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "shatter old loyalties" reweights "variant allegiance" without moralizing. Final image (sun in gold) offers non-literal answer to "shape new dawn" query, avoiding tidy binaries while embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("ozone-tasting sorrow," "static and shadow") persists under pressure, but diction stays uniformly poetic during Great Storm climax—lacks stress-induced compression. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively early on.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Minor paraphrase loop ("etched the phrase... collecting fragments") and repetitive "lyrically prophetic" usage trigger -0.4 deduction. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; rhythm varies naturally though final broadcast slightly overwrites with "gritty whimsy" label.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "prophet in storm" trope via radio-static mechanics and cobalt refraction. Emotional specificity ("rumor of lightning," "shepherd of ghosts") avoids generic templates, though "variant allegiance" concept lacks full exploration. Fresh inflection in map's third path.</comment>
