<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("displaced rooted") and embodied trauma-memory drive choices, but final motivation shift lacks contradictory impulses; "mathematics of mercy" borders on thematic echo without deeper conflict in climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: UV penance reconfigured from punishment to crucible with conceptual cost ("rounding error" line). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Violet forest’s pressure ("weight, a pressure") charges the final image, but fails to constrain tactical choices; moss path and bone-white tree remain atmospheric rather than functional under Q3 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via textural escalation (UV light’s "liquid intensity"), but the conceptual cost lacks visceral on-page manifestation; "mathematics of mercy" desire isn’t tested through action until the unresolved ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "pewter strap" reprise and UV penance reframing, avoiding moralizing; "rounding error" line crystallizes conceptual cost without stating a moral, though mercy’s mathematics remains abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline awareness of his own body") modulates under pressure; rhythmic control in trauma-memory fragments ("jagged lines of failure") with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "sickly purple" pewter strap exemplifies textural specificity. Near-miss: "symphony of self-knowledge" skirts cliché but redeemed by "tormentors' gift" context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory torture and mathematical mercy avoids genre tropes; "proprioceptively enhanced" transforms interrogation cliché through concrete stakes. Lacks one bold risk to breach 9.0.</comment>
