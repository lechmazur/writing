<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulous nature and aversion to human interaction manifest concretely in his rejection of "shouting down a hurricane" for direct confrontation; his choice to pursue lateral investigation reveals contradictory impulses (safety vs. curiosity) with visible cost to his solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "the storm-that-wasn’t beckoning him into the dark" crystallizes foreclosed safety with conceptual cost, while causal linkage (pigeon → coordinates → subway plan) holds without breaks under the Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The courtyard’s "residual warmth bled from cobblestones" and "damp ivy" establish atmospheric pressure but fail to constrain choices; tools (barometers, schematics) charge the final image yet lack mid-scene tactical impact required for 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from "prickling on his neck" to the pigeon’s arrival, culminating in Elias sacrificing solitude for truth; the cost—"restore the integrity of his solitude"—is unmistakable in the final line’s "whetstone" metaphor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges through weather-as-order metaphor: "elegant physics of a cold front" reframed by "storm-that-wasn’t" reweights integrity’s fragility without moralizing, with the final image answering the central question through atmospheric irony.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in scientific diction ("barometric pressures," "wind shear coordinates"); rhythmic control peaks during the realization sequence where syntax compresses like a "predictive curve" without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion falters only in "prickling on his neck" (bodily cliché), slightly dulling the high-pressure pigeon arrival beat; otherwise, zero loops and precise texture elevate every line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms quarantine tropes via meteorological lens: "lateral progression" through weather data as map feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (quiet mission over confrontation) heightening stakes through professional specificity.</comment>
