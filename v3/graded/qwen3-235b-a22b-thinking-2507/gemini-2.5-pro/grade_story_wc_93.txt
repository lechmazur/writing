<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses (preserve patterns vs. harness tide) drive high-stakes choice; embodied cost in slumped posture and eels' distress avoids diagnostic labels despite "pre cognitively cursed" phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: promise kept but curse endures, with felt cost in physical collapse; causal lens holds through star dust activation, though "mathematical sequences were not just a map; they were a circuit" slightly breaks dramatization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Basalt bluff and magnetic boots actively constrain movement during climax; star dust's weight and aurora's light become tactical tools that charge the final image of "dawn felt like it might be his own".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's agency: vision compels star dust use, creating irreversible trade-off (depleting last resort); cost legible in exhaustion but could deepen the promise's emotional weight beyond physical strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete struggle: "harmony with slick reality" reframed by diverted tide and reclaimed dawn; avoids moralizing though Elara's "harmony" line risks thematic echo without sufficient counterweight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("frictionless wall of water," "panicked fractals") persists under stress; rhythmic control in climax ("The wave did not crash; it split") modulates tension without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but adjacent sentences "The mathematical sequences... were a circuit. The star dust was the power source" create paraphrase loop; otherwise exceptional propulsion and specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes mathematical mysticism and physics into fresh "eel herder" premise; risk-taking (star dust as black hole) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "collapsed star dust" edges toward trope.</comment>
