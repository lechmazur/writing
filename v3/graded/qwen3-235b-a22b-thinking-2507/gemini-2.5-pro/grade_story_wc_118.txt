<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses; Kaelen's passive realization ("understood now") replaces earned micro-choices under pressure. Final renunciation lacks visible cost beyond stated sorrow, violating embodied emotion standards for peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: diary fragments accumulate density toward Charged Poise closure where the tapestry/diary union crystallizes stakes with undeniable conceptual cost ("archivists of the ache").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silo walls as micro-setting charge closure by constraining Kaelen's method ("cupping memory like water"); bronze quiet evolves from atmospheric detail to embodied cost in final image, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cause of hollowing) tightens through diary revelations, but pressure lacks protagonist agency—Kaelen merely receives knowledge. Cost is conceptual (irretrievable loss) but not viscerally dramatized in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: tapestry/diary union reweights "dragons" as archetypal tether. Final image ("world without imagination") delivers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("feel the ghost of the ink") modulates under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure. Slight register drift in "spiritual foundation" risks academic tone but remains voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("frantic emotion that had guided it") propels momentum. Minor figurative muddle ("sorrow heavy as bronze") in climax prevents 9.0, but closure image remains razor-sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival quest with psychic apocalypse avoids tropes; "bronze quiet" as embodied tone rather than cliché. Risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meeting 9+ quick test.</comment>
