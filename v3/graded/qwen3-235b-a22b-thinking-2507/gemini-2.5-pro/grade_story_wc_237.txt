<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak; stress manifests as literal crystalline lattice, not abstract labels. Micro-choices (setting aside ink, repurposing quill) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost in "fresh prickle of anxiety traced a new, sharp line."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: crystals dissolving into "flakes of light" reconfigures options with undeniable cost ("hard, translucent shell he had carried for months"). Accumulative lens holds—pressure tightens via breath-holding and crystalline spread without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Micro-setting constrains choice: floating platform’s abyss currents carry dissolved crystals, charging the final image. Tool (quill) evolves from writing instrument to tracing stylus, directly enabling the climax’s action and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten texturally as breath-holding intensifies ("captured air feeling heavy, finite") and crystals spread. Agency is clear—Elian’s pivot to folk method forecloses academic solutions with felt cost ("months of suffering" flaking away), perfectly scaled for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: naming scars as "Hesitation," "Pride" reweights "transform into legible stories" without moralizing. Final image ("blank page ready for new stories") resonates as non-literal answer to central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "world existed only within the confines of that held breath" compresses urgency. Rhythmic control peaks in climax—short clauses ("He lowered... whispered... followed") mirror tension before lyrical resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "moss-slicked stone" and "glittering lattice of veins" deliver textural specificity. No figurative muddle—"crystals softened, sharp edges blurring" avoids purple prose while charging the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "stress manifests physically" trope via rune scholar lens: crystalline scars as "frozen scars" requiring naming, not banishment. Fresh inflection feels inevitable when academic runes fail against folk wisdom’s embodied truth.</comment>
