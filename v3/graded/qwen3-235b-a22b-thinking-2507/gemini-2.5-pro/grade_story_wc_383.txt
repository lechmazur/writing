<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "skepticism screamed... longing was stronger," but Lyra's "other half of his soul" edges toward stock phrasing. Micro-choice of pressing harder against the spire reveals value hierarchy with cost, though backstory summary exceeds BRR limits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within 40 words ("Elian clutched... velvet garden"). Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the tear signifies "wholeness won," not just sorrow. Accumulative lens holds perfectly through memory's textural bleed to archiving climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet garden's moss actively mutes footsteps affecting movement, while resonance structures' light enables memory bleed. Seashell constrains choice (jagged edge placement) and charges final image ("fell silent"), meeting 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single dominant stake (archive memory vs. safe isolation) tightens through Accumulative deepening as whispers coalesce to full vision. Cost crystallizes in "ghost of her hand slipping" versus severing connection, though "independence wasn't safety" risks thematic echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: "mosaic of his identity" reweights premise without moralizing. Final tear's shifted meaning ("not for sorrow... but for wholeness") delivers non-literal answer to central question with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sky the color of a deep bruise," "ghostly resolve") modulates under pressure. "Psycho-acoustics" creates minor register drift during climax, but lyric compression ("sun-drenched afternoon shattered by flash") teaches its pattern early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero closure-impacting loops; rhythm varies from staccato ("A wave of dizziness struck him") to flowing ("eastern sky... pale to grey silk"). "Tragically radiant" is label-only, but "tear tracked through dust" achieves textural specificity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "recovered memory" trope through specific mechanics: resonance structures as "arcane machinery," archiving as active choice. Avoids derivative pitfalls via sensory grounding, though "perpetually alone" summary slightly undermines freshness.</comment>
