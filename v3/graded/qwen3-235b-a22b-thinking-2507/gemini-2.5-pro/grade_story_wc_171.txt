<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's "gentle tone underpinned with steel" during the sigil ritual; generals' embodied conflict (Kaelen's trembling hand, Vorlag's "crumbling" defiance) reveals values hierarchy with visible cost at signing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: Vorlag's "grunted surrender" and the moons' "unified light" crystallize stakes with undeniable conceptual cost; Accumulative lens holds through ritual density escalation without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Terrace decay actively constrains choice—scraping dust for the sigil directly alters tactics; "flawed beauty" recharged in final image where "fragile peace" inheres in the very marble dust of ancestors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through ritual density (dust sigil deepening symbolic weight), narrowing options to the signing moment; cost is visceral in Kaelen's "trembling" hand and Vorlag's surrendered "jagged signature" foreclosing war's path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "redemption's price" reweighted by the dust sigil becoming a literal cost (ancestral dust binding signatures), avoiding moralizing through the final image's "fragile peace" charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's negotiator lexicon ("operatively gentle," "midwife peace"); rhythmic control intensifies under pressure with purposeful fragments ("The moment was fraying") teaching the Accumulative lens early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "shattered promise" marble metaphor simultaneously advances setting, character state, and theme; final line avoids cliché by understating "long difficult work" after the charged signing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transforms peace-treaty trope through specific ritual mechanics—the dust sigil's physical constraint creates emotional truth in generals' reluctant signatures, avoiding middle-ground hedging with "flawed beauty" as core vision.</comment>
