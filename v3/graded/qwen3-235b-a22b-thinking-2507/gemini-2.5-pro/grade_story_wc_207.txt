<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—collector versus preserver—clash in her final choice to leave the lagoon, with the cost of relinquishing her vials legible as she places the compass down. No stock phrasing; her eccentricity roots every action, like psychometry draining her yet guiding the pivotal turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "to bottle this would be to cage a ghost" crystallizes the cost of her renunciation, with the compass’s stillness embodying earned stasis. Accumulative lens holds—the scent’s accumulation reweights stakes without causal breaks, and orientation anchors instantly via "petrichor collector."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The lagoon’s luminescence and scent constrain Elara’s choice, charging the final image where she carries only "the resonant hush." Sensory hierarchy shines: her professional focus on petrichor narrows perception to the mineral breath, avoiding tourist cataloging while mirroring her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation—the hunt for the inexplicable tightens when the compass fails, forcing reliance on psychometry. The cost of not collecting is felt in her physical act of leaving vials behind, reconfiguring her entire purpose under Accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lagoon’s refusal to be captured: "cage a ghost" avoids moralizing while reweighting her quest as sacred preservation. The final image—a lone figure carrying silence—resonates as a non-literal answer to "explanations fail," with no thematic echo or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is immaculate: "cataloged the world by its rains" filters all detail through her sensory obsession. Rhythm modulates with pressure—psychometry’s ghost-impressions use fragmented syntax that resolves into the lagoon’s serene cadence, taught and paid off flawlessly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "resonant hush" evolves from setting detail to closure motif without muddle. One minor register drift: "phantom aroma" edges toward cliché in a high-pressure beat, but the lagoon’s "captured aurora" redeems density with visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transforms the "cave discovery" trope through petrichor framing—the lagoon’s scent as "ancient starlight" synthesizes geology and wonder into emotional truth. Risk-taking (psychometry as plot device) heightens stakes coherently, with the hinged stone turn feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
