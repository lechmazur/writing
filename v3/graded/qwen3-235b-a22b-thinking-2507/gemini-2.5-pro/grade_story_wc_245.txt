<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority excels through embodied emotion ("sorrowful F, a hopeful A-minor") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the note collection. Final renunciation of silence for harmony is earned by the melody's progression with visible cost in "grief not disappear, but settle." No stock phrasing; flaws drive the journey organically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands cleanly: the Stillpoint's harmony reconfigures Kaelen's understanding with undeniable cost ("sharp edges smoothed into a bearable shape"). Accumulative lens holds throughout—density increase via note accumulation tightens options. Orientation clear by paragraph one; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting through Kaelen's tactile perception ("crystalline rivers that sang with memory of minerals"), constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details reflect urgency (filtering noise) and POV bias. Platinum ring and hide map qualify as tools that charge closure through reweighted meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds—note collection builds density until the "space between things" twist. Dominant stake (silence for grief) is dramatized through Kaelen's dowsing agency. Cost is legible in transformed grief, though a visible sacrifice (e.g., stamina loss) would strengthen the 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions: the melody's evolution from "dirge to anthem" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights silence as harmony without stating a moral, offering a resonant answer to the central question. No thematic echo; complexity embraces grief's transformation without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("mapmaker who had never seen a map"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (e.g., clipped syntax during dowsing). Tactile POV remains consistent; no head-hopping. Minor register flattening during high-stress moments prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with minimal redundancies, though near-looping in note descriptions ("sorrowful F... hopeful A-minor") triggers −0.2. Propulsion remains strong, and closure beat ("sharp edges smoothed") avoids figurative muddle. No scaffold in peak beats, but rhythmic monotony in transitional phrasing limits 8.8+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of blindness + sonic landscape transforms grief tropes. "Space between things" twist feels earned through established dowsing mechanics. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, though the core journey risks familiarity without the ultrasonic forest's distinctive logic.</comment>
