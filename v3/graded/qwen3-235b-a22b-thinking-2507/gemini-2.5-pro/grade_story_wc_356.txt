<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elara's olfactory vulnerability versus serenity goal, but the corpse flower's legendary stench remains a theoretical threat without on-page consequence, slightly weakening the earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the calm she had cultivated not in the soil of the pot, but in the soil of herself" crystallizes the cost (sensory assault) and reconfigures ambition into partnership under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nose constrains choice and charges the finale—her olfactory sensitivity enables both crisis ("pain bloomed behind her eyes") and resolution (anchoring to the seed's scent), fulfilling the 9+ gate for micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation via sensory density ("riot of smells... acrid tang... wet-fur scent") deepens the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens, but the flower's promised stench never materializes as tangible opposition, limiting cost escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wrapping paper's evolution: final doodle of "a single, still point" reweights "the undercurrent of wisdom" as internal cultivation without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is impeccable—sensory details narrow under stress ("nutty, earthy aroma"), with rhythmic shifts mirroring calm ("wildflower hush") to chaos ("cacophony of information") and back, taught early via wind chimes' "ceaseless, shifting melody."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "groaned their familiar song" compresses rope bridges' significance economically, though "cacophony of information" slightly drifts into clinical diction during peak pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ingenuity in redefining serenity as dynamic equilibrium ("quiet partnership") rather than passive calm, but the treetop village setting risks familiar eco-fantasy tropes without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
