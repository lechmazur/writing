<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in regret-to-release shift; ghost's "It wasn't our fault" rationalization embodies self-preservation flaw without diagnostic labels. Final choice earned through tactile memory of camera wheel, though ghost dialogue slightly generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: "regret was not a weight anymore, but a release" crystallizes stance with cost ("My ambition broke it"). Accumulative lens holds through density shift from "fractured stillness" to clarity; temporal confusion resolved via concrete object.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon evolves from "taunt" to "simple fact," directly charging final image. Camera wheel constrains choice (triggers memory) and reappears in pocketed closure. Micro-setting mastery: crystallized condensation/dust pile grounds scavenging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting hubris) tightens via camera wheel discovery, forcing memory that narrows options to acceptance. Protagonist agency drives escalation ("It was my fault"), with visible cost in dissolved arrogance. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: carousel's halted motion mirrors Kael's pride, resolved when lagoon becomes "simple fact." Final stillness reweights "fractured stillness" without moralizing; "monument to eroded ambitions" avoids tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes through engineer's lexicon ("harmonics report," "stress tolerances") and temporal distortion. Rhythmic control peaks in memory sequence ("child crying... ozone... woman's voice"), compressing time without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sound congealed like amber" exemplifies high-density imagery. Final paragraph's cadence shift ("He pocketed... scavenging wasn't over...") propels closure without figurative muddle. "Roaring fire" metaphor risks cliché but redeemed by context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms "engineer's regret" trope via kinetic lagoon as consequence of halted motion. Camera wheel as unrecorded failure token feels inevitable; specificity of "disposable camera wheel, its tiny teeth" avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking in temporal fluidity heightens stakes.</comment>
