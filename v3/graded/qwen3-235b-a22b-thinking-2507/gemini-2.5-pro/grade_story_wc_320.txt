<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" drives concrete micro-choices (discarding assumptions) with embodied emotion ("cold dread settled in her bones"). Final choice earned through prior causality (mentor's lesson) without diagnostic label-speak. Single-POV constraints prevent perfect 10.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens clear by midpoint; "inverting gain" creates decisive Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Cost unmistakable: "learned to listen with a new kind of soul" reconfigures her entire perceptual framework. Orientation flawless within 30 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Radio tower actively constrains tactics (fragment placement beside signal stream) and charges closure ("abandoned" → "waiting"). Gorge wind motif evolves from "lonely note" to "tangible pressure," directly shaping the climax. Micro-setting (velvet case) essential to final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately ("ultimate prize"); escalation driven by protagonist agency (method shift) intensifies to "tower groaned" climax. Cost legible in the conceptual transformation: silence as "coiled spring of reality" reweights her entire understanding with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "inverting gain" to hunt "structured null-point" becomes the non-literal answer to "beginning in every ending." Final image ("towers felt like waiting") reweights "abandoned" opening without moralizing. Zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("serenely electric air," "ghost-whispers") reflects interpreter mindset. Rhythm modulates perfectly: long setup sentences fracture into staccato during climax ("The speakers hissed..."). Diction stays within scientist's lexicon ("structured null-point").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; every sentence propels narrative ("Standard filtration protocols were useless, like trying to catch a raindrop in a hurricane" does triple duty). Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Read-aloud rhythm mirrors signal chaos → silence transition flawlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "scientist breakthrough" trope via cosmic perspective ("structured silence"). "Hollywood star fragment" as resonant body (not amplifier) is fresh inflection. Emotional truth in frustration-to-breakthrough arc avoids abstraction. Specific detail ("inverting gain") grounds risk-taking.</comment>
