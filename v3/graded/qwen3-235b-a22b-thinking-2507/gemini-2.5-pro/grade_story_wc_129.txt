<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("luminescent ache") is embodied via reed-weaving and heart-hammering, but internal contradiction lacks friction during pivotal search; transformation feels earned through cloth exchange yet avoids deeper struggle with solitude.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "two halves of his world become one" reconfigures stakes with visible cost (abandoned solitude) under Accumulative/Textural lens; crater’s light and reed-obsidian fusion crystallize pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard constrains choices (Kaelen searches mossy fissures due to weaver’s knowledge) and charges closure; reeds become practical offering, fulfilling 9+ gate by shaping final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stake (belonging vs. isolation) tightens via search discovery, but cost of joining lacks visceral weight; "nervous rhythm" shows tension yet resolution’s warmth undersells the "luminescent ache’s" prior severity under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "small, offered trusts" and reed mats as "practical prayer," avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "luminescent ache" into "steady glow" as resonant answer to grafting desire without stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines (weaver’s eye for textures), but "boldly sympathetic" slips into summary; rhythm modulates under pressure ("feverish clarity" weaving) with no head-hopping, though Lyra’s minimal dialogue lacks distinct idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phosphorescent vine glowing with soft internal light" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor deduction for "simple, desperate need" as label-only phrase, but compensated by concrete actions in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms community trope via reed-weaving specificity and crystalline soil; "practical prayer" offering avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes, but "luminescent ache" borders on familiar phrasing without full reinvention.</comment>
