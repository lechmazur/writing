<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses shine: Alistair clutches preservation artifacts while realizing frozen hands can't carve, yet Elara's bread 'A' sparks actionable hope. Warm loaf 'A' as micro-choice crystallizes values with visible cost—no over-tidiness, just embodied dread shifting to ragged hope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is Charged Poise: the reborn waterfall's roar "washing away rosewater dread" reconfigures survival as cultural resurrection. Cost is legible in "frozen stiff hands" earlier; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory decay (dimming moss, silence) tightens into resonant thaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Waterfall ice isn't backdrop but active constraint—Alistair's lens reveals stress fractures, forcing pitch adjustment. Final image of water "washing over frozen moss" charges closure by making environment the literal vessel of renewal, not mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via Alistair's agency: council resignation → sonic resonance insight → guiding pitch ("Higher!"). Cost is visceral ("frozen stiff hands"), but beekeeper timeframe lacks live-clock pressure, slightly diluting escalation's inevitability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through singing-as-thaw: "persuade the ice" reframes preservation as active survival. Final image reweights "rosewater dread" into hope without moralizing, though "soul of their culture" edges toward abstraction in the last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Alistair filters ice fractures through emerald lens, bakers' yeast scent cuts sterile cold. Rhythm modulates from "damp quiet" to "thunderous roar" with purposeful compression; no head-hopping despite communal scenes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero closure artifacts; "rosewater dread" and "historically oriented" risk thematic echo but avoid moralizing. Minor paraphrase loop in "damp quiet... profound silence" deducts 0.2—dense yet propulsive prose otherwise.</comment>
<question>8</question><question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sonic ice-thaw via cultural anthems transforms displacement tropes. Bread initials aren't quirk but tactical pivot—Elara's 'A' loaf crystallizes agency. Risks lyric density yet earns every image through causal stakes.</comment>
