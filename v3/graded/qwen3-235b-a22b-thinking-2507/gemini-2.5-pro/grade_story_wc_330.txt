<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in embodied silence ("rusty voice") and micro-choices (hanging bells as clock) feel earned. Backstory ("wrong turn") lacks concrete impact on present tactics, slightly weakening causal chain for singing climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "silence... no longer an absence but a listening" reconfigures meaning with visceral cost (voice cracking after decade). Wind gust coincidence slightly undermines Accumulative escalation but doesn't break closure's earned weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting mastery: wind bells become active clock ("measure my days"), and halo's "whispering gleam" literally charges the final image. Dusty air patterns transform silence from void to listening space—environment constrains every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silence as void vs possibility) tightens through Elias' agency: carving flourishes shifts work from mending to creating. Wind gust coincidence slightly dilutes protagonist-driven escalation, but singing's cost ("rusty voice") is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action: "filled the quiet not by defeating it" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of mare's eyes holding the crown's reflection reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost—zero thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature flawless: carpenter notices "splintered limb" textures, "tarnished cups" of bells. Rhythm shifts from slow decay ("tick of decay") to frantic symphony. Only "feeling too vast for his chest" slightly overwrites.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "misting hush" motif avoids cliché through concrete details. "Weightless click" slightly strains physics but serves voice. Final line’s rhythm ("testament not to what was lost") delivers closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Transforms "magical object" trope through specific carpentry logic. Risk-taking in making silence the active character pays off: "mist" isn’t weather but embodied state. No derivative echoes—halo as "spun moonlight" feels fresh.</comment>
