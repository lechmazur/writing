<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Elias's map obsession versus bodily rawness, but "daringly methodical" trait remains label-only without visible tradeoffs during the search sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "leaving the weight... behind," but the graffiti's sudden appearance lacks sufficient setup to fully satisfy Accumulative escalation under the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Disused station actively pressures choices (navigating ivy, finding stall) and charges closure; the duct-taped accordion's physicality constrains every key beat from opening to final abandonment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Elias's agency under Accumulative lens as sensory density narrows options to the graffiti revelation, with cost legible in the accordion's abandonment altering his future path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete map/territory reframing in the final image ("he was the one who drew the lines"), avoiding moralizing while offering resonant non-literal answer to self-forgiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("world felt like sandpaper") modulates rhythm with emotional intensity, though "daringly methodical" briefly drifts into abstract narration during high-pressure search.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops with masterful propulsion ("a broken lung that could still breathe a fractured tune"), but "daringly methodical" constitutes minor register drift in a peak beat without contextual payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief tropes through specific river/accordion/duct-tape details; transformation test passed as swapping the accordion would break causal logic of the closure act.</comment>
