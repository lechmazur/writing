<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("myth buster by trade, truth-seeker by soul") manifests in accepting invisible cosmic scars as truth. Final endurance choice earned through "cheerful frustration" micro-choices and visible cost of "gloomy cheerfulness" crystallizing lifelong task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: dust motes' dissolution reveals "invisible resonant scar," making "lifelong" task undeniable. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density buildup in tuning sequence narrows options to single resonant frequency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Observatory setting actively constrains choices: wind-scoured location explains howling counter-melody, grime-caked dome justifies floor-focused revelation. Dust motes' transformation charges final image while raw cello wood enables shell vibration—micro-setting shapes closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elias' agency: tuning peg adjustments narrow options to precise frequency, with "trembling arm" revealing physical cost. Dominant stake ("decode riddle") tightens via resonant hums, making "gloomy cheerfulness" an undeniable emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "universe sings in the when" reweights into "resonant scar" discovery. Final image of shell held "note by resonant note" offers non-literal answer to cosmic significance without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("dust motes dancing," "monotone prayer to physics") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from flowing sentences to staccato climax ("Silence, profound and absolute"), with patterned elision of Thorne's voice taught early and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances density: "ozone and anticipation" compresses sensory detail, "needle of light" crystallizes payoff. Final line’s "note by resonant note" echoes method while charging closure, with no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "ephemeral compass" as terrestrial resonance rather than device. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off through specificity—dust motes' dissolution feels inevitable, avoiding derivative observatory tropes via physics-driven revelation.</comment>
