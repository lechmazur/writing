<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness fuels her tactile method ("does not search for the faded profile"), creating authentic contradictory impulses: urgency versus meticulous touch. Cost is conceptual (library’s destruction vs. eternal sky), though personal stakes could deepen further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "unending cosmos held within walls about to fall" crystallizes beauty within limits under Accumulative lens. Minor quibble: coin-to-lock translation lacks concrete mechanics, but cost remains unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tree library’s wood grain actively enables the sky’s fractal spread ("spreading through the grain"), charging the final image. Sensory specificity ("air tasted of ancient paper") avoids symbolism, grounding theme in texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Demolition deadline tightens pressure organically ("first returning tremor... Time was up"), narrowing options to one decisive act. Cost is visceral in "walls about to fall" against the "unending cosmos," perfectly scaled for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Discovering limits was not about defeating them..." emerges through action, not moralizing. Final sky reweights the premise: boundless wonder contained within destruction, avoiding tidy resolution while resonating emotionally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: Elara notices textures, not faces ("chaos of history scored into its metal"). Rhythm modulates under pressure—lyrical during coin work, clipped at "Time was up"—with zero POV drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances tension or theme. "Cerulean light bled" avoids cliché through precise causality (light spreading via wood grain), with flawless rhythm in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Face-blind artist using limitation as strength transforms a familiar premise. Emotional truth in "beauty within boundaries" avoids abstraction, with specific details ("chemist’s acid scratch") making the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>
