<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (sterile perfection vs. emotional presence) drives micro-choices like dropping the nautilus shell; embodied cost in Kael's tear makes closure visceral without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("glint of a tear tracing a path through the dust"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds through emotional density buildup without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Micro-setting (crystalline dust) constrains choice via sound ("crunch... unnaturally loud") and charges closure (dust on tear); recurring nautilus shell reweights meaning through active handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Stakes viscerally felt through Kael's departure forcing Elara's paradigm shift; cost legible in the tear and "it was enough" under Accumulative lens without convenient resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (flawed sun vs. shared glance); final image reweights "density of presence" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in the resonant "it was enough."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("logarithmic spiral," "calcium carbonate") modulates to emotional urgency; rhythmic control under pressure via sentence fragmentation during the confession beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("warm, complex gold that seemed to breathe") with precise verbs; no figurative muddle despite lyrical moments in the sun's transformation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy trope through emotional calculus; "density of presence" concept transformed via specific stakes (Kael's departure) rather than abstract novelty.</comment>
