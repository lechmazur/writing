<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete ("cold piece of brass: an antique drawer pull") with contradictory impulses (seeing Kaelen as mirror while bearing past miscalculation). Final choice earned through tactile micro-choices under pressure, avoiding stock phrasing. Kaelen's depth slightly thin but functional for scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "wisdom had cast a brief, hopeful light" reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost ("forgiveness... had not yet arrived"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ritual density (moon phases, key mechanics), though moon-phase explanation slightly tells.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Recurring drawer pull constrains choice (key mechanism) and charges closure ("cold brass... faintly warm in his palm"). Mist and parapet pressure decisions (no treachery possible), with sensory details filtered through negotiator's urgency—no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (healing "fresh wounds" via exchange) tightens through Elias's agency under Accumulative lens. The untethering narrows options with visible cost (unresolved forgiveness), though Kaelen's role slightly passive in escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: drawer pull's history and ritual reweight "recycling mistakes" into wisdom. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing—avoids thematic echo while embracing complexity of partial healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (tactile focus: "mist tasted of salt," brass temperature) modulates rhythm under pressure. Kaelen's sparse dialogue carries subtext ("The lockbox"), though distinction slightly thin at emotional peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances tension ("a furrowed hush settled"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("chasm far wider than the parapet"). Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: ritualistic exchange via moon phases and drawer-pull key transforms familiar tropes. Emotional truth in "wisdom paying dividend of life" while forgiveness lags. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens) heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
