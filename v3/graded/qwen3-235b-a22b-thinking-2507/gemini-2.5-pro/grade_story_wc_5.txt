<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure; the stillness motif is embodied but emotional layers feel curated rather than authentically conflicted. Final thumb-seal action earns endurance through prior tactile details ("knees cracking").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the burning map crystallizes options with visceral cost ("knees cracking") under Accumulative/Textural lens. Single deepening (pulse to steady path) suffices for scope, but early orientation anchors flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Withered orchard functions as micro-setting: brittle twigs directly constrain map-making choices and charge the final image ("sinking back to ground"). Sensory details (ozone smell, frozen soil) are selective, urgent, and POV-filtered through alchemical purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("world held its breath") despite visceral execution; the child's danger isn't felt through Kaelen's actions. Escalation via starlight pouring succeeds, but dominant stake lacks concrete on-page test beyond the ritual itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly through "translating heartbeats" into tangible hope; final image reweights the opening stillness as active endurance without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in concrete acts (thumb-seal as "anchor against panic").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: alchemical focus narrows sensory hierarchy to textures (brittle twigs, gossamer paper). Rhythmic control modulates from frozen patience to urgent light-pouring. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally with stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No loops or scaffold; "liquid luminescence spilled into the crater’s gloom" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in "resonant marrow of his bones" (near-closure) deducts 0.1, but rhythm varies masterfully under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transforms alchemy trope through specific logic: flash paper, starlight physics, and heartbeat mapping feel inevitable. Risk-taking (ritual as conflict resolution) heightens stakes coherently; "moving stillness" redefines patience as active resistance.</comment>
