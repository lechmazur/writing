<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation ("discover what ceilings hide") drives the pivotal choice to engage; embodied contradiction in "weightless burden" avoids therapy-speak. Final renunciation of leaving earns closure via prior causality (ghost’s gesture → dust analysis).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via sensory density (dripping water, disturbed dust) to Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in Leo’s physical reach and the ghost’s dissolution—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The drop ceiling’s dust patterns constrain Leo’s choice (tile disturbance guides investigation), charging the final image. "Greasy guts of the lift" and "furry grey blanket" reflect technician’s POV with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when dust patterns reveal shifted tile—Leo’s agency (dragging ladder) narrows options. Cost is felt in the ghost’s dissolution and Leo’s "mended no machine" realization under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "cracks in the façade" evolves from peeling clowns to the ghost’s unresolved task. Final line reweights "ceiling secrets" without moralizing—pure conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "dust accumulation patterns" and "lines of settled grime" reflect technician’s bias. Rhythm modulates perfectly—"Silence crashed down" compresses tension without scaffold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "faint, shimmering outlines... as harmless as dust motes" does triple duty (character, setting, theme). Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle—"repaired a crack in the veil" avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: elevator technician/ghost-seer investigating circus ceiling. Transforms tropes via specific stakes (mainspring barrel for carousel clock)—emotional truth in "weightless burden" avoids sentimentality.</comment>
