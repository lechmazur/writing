<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her realization she's not "waking houses" but creating "fissures" for occupants—embodied through the orris root's scent triggering the epiphany. Avoids therapy-speak; cost is visceral ("hollowing out she felt in her own chest"). Slight abstraction in "hushed blaze" metaphor prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the man's "crack in the grey facade" and flowers reconfigure sterility's inevitability. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—pressure tightens through pattern disruption (mats, gargoyle, root) culminating in her knowledge shift. Cost proof crystallized in the flamingo's "bewildered contemplation."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Micro-setting triumph: the orris root shard constrains choice (her only weapon against sterility) and charges the final image ("hushed blaze" echoing its "organic chaos"). Salt air and rock garden crunch anchor urgency. "Quiet bay" setting lacks active pressure on tactics, missing 9.0 gate by hair's breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her white-cube act deepens knowledge (the "inadvertently profound" realization), narrowing options from object-placement to human awakening. Cost is visceral (heart "hammering") and conceptual (sterility's spread). Flaw: the flamingo moment edges toward coincidence, but mat-swap precedent earns it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through "shard of hush" motif—never stated, only shown via displaced objects. Final image ("hushed blaze passing from one awakened soul") offers resonant, non-literal answer to "why houses feel dead" with conceptual cost (the bay's transformation requires ongoing effort). Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in "defiant flower" vs. sterility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is stellar ("student of creeping normality," "lawns grew too perfect"). Rhythm varies from lyrical ("salt-heavy air smelled of mud") to staccato ("Her heart hammered"). Slight register drift in "purveyor of tiny, startling questions" and mechanical "hushed blaze" repetition prevent 9.0. Zero head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("crunch of her sneakers an obscene violation" shows pressure). "Slow smile touched Elara’s lips" borders cliché, and "garish pink flamingo" feels overwrought. No artifacts in closure beat ("different kind of life was stirring" clean), but minor figurative muddle in peak beats blocks 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "fighting conformity" trope through micro-actions (mat swaps, orris root). "Shard of hush" concept feels fresh, and specificity (gargoyle facing sea) elevates it. Risk-taking (quiet Charged Poise closure) heightens stakes. White-cube antagonist slightly familiar, but bay's transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
