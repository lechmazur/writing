<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear but internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses; calm demeanor stated without testing under pressure. Final packing lacks visible personal cost beyond abstract "purpose fulfilled."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: spiral mosaic crystallizes transformation with conceptual cost (departure). Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via photo-arc patterning to the final paper boat gesture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lavender field/factory ruins constrain choices (photo placement surface, vine growth as clock); recurring map case charges final image. Sensory details (scent, rust) evolve with plot to the clean creek's payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (community healing) signaled early but pressure lacks tangible complication; escalation relies on photo accumulation alone. Cost legible via Elias's departure yet personal sacrifice remains abstract, limiting deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through photo-arc reconfiguration: tear-streaked cheek to smiling mouth avoids moralizing. Final spiral image answers "transmutation" question with scarred soil metaphor, rejecting simplistic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines: "geography of a community's heart" filters all observation. Rhythm modulates from meditative (vine growth) to crystalline (final spiral), with no head-hopping in single-POV lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops; "skeletal fingers clawing" exemplifies purposeful density. Final line "leaving the field to the bees" avoids overwriting while charging closure. Minor cadence risk in "fragments of a larger, unbroken story" mitigated by thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms archival trope through photo-arc methodology: pain-to-hope transitions feel earned via specific visual echoes. Risk-taking (mosaic closure) heightens stakes without gimmickry, with "scarred soil" resisting generic optimism.</comment>
