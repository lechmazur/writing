<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation but internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses; "encrypt vulnerability as strength" edges toward diagnostic label-speak under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves flawless Charged Poise: the shifted hum and fractal bloom crystallize emotional cost through sensory reconfiguration, with lens (Accumulative/Textural) holding through final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Micro-setting (bone dice) constrains choice and charges closure, though lab description leans slightly generic; bioluminescent pulse actively reweights stakes in final beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation through density (recursive cipher) deepens stakes effectively, but dice resolution relies on chance rather than protagonist agency narrowing options under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically via dice (chance vs control) and dance; final fractal bloom offers resonant non-literal answer to "vulnerability as strength" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sound woven into fabric of silence") with rhythmic control under pressure; minor register drift in "lyrical code breaker" jargon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion; "spider spins web" simile lacks payoff but avoids scaffold; no artifacts dull closure’s sensory precision in final three lines.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical and emotional logic through bone dice mechanics; transforms "mother’s legacy" trope via vulnerability-as-encryption without safety-hedging.</comment>
