<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (holding on vs. release) manifests in embodied micro-choices like thumb-rubbing the button; closure earns renunciation through prior causality. Slight deduction for minimal secondary pressure beyond the spectral figures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with palpable cost ("profound exhaustion," extinguished wildfire) under a clear Causal lens. Orientation anchors within 50 words; no causality breaks in the decisive button-press sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms function as micro-setting that constrains choice (timing before birdsong) and charges the final image ("air returning to normal luminescence"). Fae Caps' dimensional friction is essential to the closure mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (helping strangers pass on) tightens via Kael's agency in the button-press, narrowing options to one irreversible choice. Cost is legible in exhaustion and emotional release, though escalation lacks a visible pre-climax trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (permeable barriers as release mechanism), avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights "letting go" as physics, not sentimentality. Slight deduction for near-miss on Q5 quick test’s non-literal answer requirement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("lattice of forces," ozone/damp earth taste) modulates rhythm under pressure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the release moment. Zero head-hopping; voice stays anchored to Kael’s spatial cognition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("heat-haze figures that his sensors ignored but his soul recognized"). Final line’s cadence shift ("he had finally let her go") recharges the opening’s "quiet wildfire" with perfect propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms grief tropes through specific sci-fi mechanics (mycelial networks as dimensional barriers). Risk-taking in quiet climax pays off with emotional precision; laser pointer button elevates mundane object into indispensable catalyst.</comment>
