<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "hollow success tasted like ash" vs boyhood wonder; burial choice earns renunciation through prior causality. Cameos slightly archetypal but "fractured journey" map makes final cost visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: burying the shell forecloses authorship path with "apology, tombstone, promise" cost. Accumulative lens holds as cameos tighten pressure without causality breaks. One tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Micro-setting succeeds: seashell’s sharp edge/warmth constrains choices (comfort→sacrifice) and charges final "fertile ground" image. Mist pressure is vivid but nexus lacks physical constraint beyond atmospheric resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stake (artistic integrity) tightens through cameo accumulation; burial choice reweights options with "nothing left but ghosts" cost. Agency pure—no coincidence—though current’s "gale" threat could deepen before climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through librarian’s scent-cataloging and mechanical-heart boy; "fertile ground" reweights failure without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo by showing "shapes of hopes" via action, not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct novelist voice ("hollow and cynical thing scoured his soul") with sensory filtering through writer’s mind. Minor register drift in "starlight caught in her hair" borders purple prose but doesn’t fracture coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density falters in two paraphrase loops ("senses stretched thin, lucidly watchful" restates alertness); "quiet, aching clarity" echoes earlier "swirling hush" without deepening. No closure artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms "writer's block" trope via visceral metaphors (asphalt-smell librarian); seashell’s spiral as "fractured journey" map feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
