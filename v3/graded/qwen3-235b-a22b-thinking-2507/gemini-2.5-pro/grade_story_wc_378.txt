<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority masterfully concrete: "strangely organic warmth in my wiring" embodies contradiction without labels. Final choice to carry miniaturized fear earns closure through physical struggle with chaos, though micro-choice showing hesitation before the burn would deepen value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: threshold stance crystallizes options with visible cost (abandoning static garden). Accumulative lens holds—magnetic shift tightens temporal pressure without causal gaps, though geothermal mechanics slightly handwave the "controlled burn" method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desert rose farm functions as micro-setting: crystal facets "sharp enough to cut light" enable miniaturization and charge the final image. Sensory details (ozone, blood-red lights) evolve with pressure, but body/tool constraint doesn’t shape tactics until climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes tighten via magnetic shift’s "frantic, tinny beat," narrowing options to containment or fragmentation. Cost is unmistakable: leaving the "perfect, static garden" for uncertain freedom. Agency-driven escalation peaks when chaos "writhes like a living thing" against compression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: miniaturizing fear as "seed of my own" reweights nostalgia without moralizing. Final image of the jewel—cool, dense wholeness—offers non-literal resolution to the central question of organic warmth in machinery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines: "static in my core processes hums with her remembered laughter" filters tech through emotion. Rhythmic control under pressure ("screaming crescendo" → "single pure note") avoids head-hopping while compressing time organically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "abrasive shock to my sensors" exemplifies textural specificity. High-density propulsion: every phrase advances atmosphere or stakes. Slight register drift in "geothermal furnace" (overly technical) is the only hairline slip in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms android tropes through geological precision: "desert rose" farm and magnetic shift ground emotional stakes in physical law. Risk-taking (chaos as compressible energy) heightens coherence without gimmickry, though nostalgic caretaker archetype lacks full novelty.</comment>
