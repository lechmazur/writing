<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction strong in micro-choices (clutching seed, harmonizing dreams) but epiphany lacks embodied physicality; "breath hitched" insufficient for peak-beat cost despite clear motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: monsoon arrival confirms cost, seed's pulse provides tactile consequence, and transformed doubt ("soft luminous glow") crystallizes reconfigured memory with conceptual price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed functions as micro-setting that charges final image; sky-plume blossoms deepen to "painful vibrancy" as memory rewinds, constraining the singing act through sensory immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Monsoon deadline tightens decisions relentlessly; panic when "wind shifted" escalates to singing under rain, with visible cost in transformed doubt that alters Elara's relationship to memory forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "lullaby of creation" reframing—not stated moral—with child's laughter becoming renewal's sound; avoids sentimentality by rooting wisdom in seed-planting action and rain's promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical world," "chaotic dream-notes") modulates under stress; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure's "drops as promise" with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "backward river/moonlight net/laughter" sequence demonstrates high density without muddle. Final image ("seed planted, story continue") avoids overwriting through earned simplicity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms memory trope via "luminous doubt" as active ingredient; "harmonizing dreams" reframing feels inevitable yet fresh, with risk-taking (no dialogue) heightening emotional specificity without gimmickry.</comment>
