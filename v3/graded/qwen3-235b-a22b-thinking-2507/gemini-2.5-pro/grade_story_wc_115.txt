<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("skeptical man" vs. acting on psychic logic) and embodied emotion ("silence a physical pressure") shine; micro-choices like grabbing the valve with "crushing weight" of guilt perfectly earn closure. Slight deduction for underdeveloped "recklessness" beyond one mention.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens (confession→sounds→valve turn→peace) holds flawlessly; orientation anchors by line 3; closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost ("weight hadn't disappeared, but... I could carry it"). The valve turn’s physical groan crystallizes the conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel—recurring object with condensation "glistening" in the headlamp—constrains the climax choice and charges the final image. Sensory details (rust smell, oily water) are selective and urgency-driven; the tunnel’s physicality forces wading and grasping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes ("I did nothing" guilt vs. factory catastrophe blame) tighten coherently under causal pressure; the radio caller’s "what I did" crystallizes the accusation, forcing the valve turn. Cost is visceral: endurance replaces resolution, legible in "the weight... hadn’t disappeared, but I could carry it."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the valve wheel’s physicality—turning it to "close what had been left open" mirrors accepting guilt—without moralizing. Final image reweights "swallowed truth" into bearable weight, avoiding tidy redemption while charging the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("world feel porous and strange" from sleep deprivation) modulates perfectly under stress; rhythmic control shifts from drowsy cadence to staccato tension. Radio voices provide subtle subtext without POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; high density ("beaded valve wheel, each bead a perfect, glistening drop") propels action. Minor deduction for "gnawing anxiety" (slightly generic) in high-pressure beat, but valve description’s concrete specificity saves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms ghost tropes through psychological specificity: the "factory ghost shift" as blame mirroring personal guilt feels inevitable. Risk-taking (radio calls as interpretive lens) heightens stakes without gimmickry, synthesizing industrial history and emotional truth.</comment>
