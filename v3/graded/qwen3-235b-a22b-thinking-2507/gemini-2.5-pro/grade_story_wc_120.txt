<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in Kaelen's exhaustion versus frantic creation, embodied through trembling hands and the nautilus' warmth. Final choice—drawing the arc with "The beginning is an echo..."—is causally earned by memory mapping, but simultaneous contradictory impulses lack peak-beat intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the mirrored horizon's silent spectacle and "subtle click of alignment" reconfigure stakes with visible cost—exhaustion as lead weight in his arm. Accumulative lens holds, though cost legibility slightly softens the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frozen lake's ice actively creates the mirrored horizon climax, charging the spire's final image as the sphere's heart. Nautilus segment functions as micro-setting, but neither constrains mid-scene tactics enough for 9+ band despite vivid specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beating exhaustion to find the keynote) tightens through memory mapping's density increase. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the dawn-triggered climax, with cost unmistakable in "energy guttered out"—though physical toll could heighten visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from memory-as-music motif; the final cookie fortune ("The quietest room...") reweights time's mastery without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in concrete action—the arc drawn on the map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("upturned hush," "calcified spiral") sustains lyrical compression, but stress-induced diction doesn't modulate enough—remains uniformly poetic during high-pressure beats like the frantic timeline sketching.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold, but high-pressure beats risk overwriting ("resonant frequencies that defined a life's trajectory") diluting momentum. Final image crystallizes cleanly, though figurative density slightly obscures the pen's physical urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-telling as causal symphony avoids cliché; "chronological homesickness" transforms time tropes through embodied specificity. Minor deduction as nautilus metaphor leans familiar despite context-driven reinvention.</comment>
