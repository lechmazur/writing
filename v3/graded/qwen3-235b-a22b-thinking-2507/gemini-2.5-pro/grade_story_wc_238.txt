<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Julian's embodied grief ("apology felt flimsy," vibrating teeth) and contradictory impulses (craving reconnection vs. accepting fractured absolution) drive the climax. Madame Vex's pragmatic magic creates secondary pressure but her Spectral Tattler motivation remains underexploited, losing 0.2.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: "fractured and painful absolution" crystallizes stakes with cost (fading lilac scent, diesel engine's growl). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density tightening, but chainsaw deadline feels slightly telegraphed early without complicating the ritual beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sheet music archive actively constrains choices: iron gall ink enables conductivity, decaying paper scent mirrors eroding memory. Perfume bottle resealing as closure image charges final cost. Meets 9+ gate but capped by Q2 <9.0 per cross-caps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology before destruction) signaled immediately. Escalation via Accumulative lens: hum intensifies, notes shimmer, scent blooms—each beat narrowing emotional options. Cost is visceral (dying embers, fading lilac), but chainsaw pressure lacks mid-scene complication beyond timer function.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" emerges through particulars: fractured absolution reweights apology. Final image (bottle "just an object" but chest "lighter") answers central question without moralizing. Madame Vex's "phantom limb" metaphor serves character, not theme sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Julian's stress narrows senses to lilac and vibrating teeth. Rhythm modulates perfectly ("He saw nothing. But he felt everything."). Slight overreach in "library of his sister’s soul" momentarily breaks POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "crawled off the page" shows not tells. Rhythm accelerates during ritual with purposeful fragments. One deduction: colon in "a deluge: the phantom sensation" slightly blurs immediacy where period would heighten gasp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms tropes: "gossip-column exorcist" tied to Spectral Tattler creates authentic tension; induced currents grounded in sheet music physics. "Fractured absolution" avoids middle-ground hedging. Orchard destruction trope lacks radical reinvention, costing 0.1.</comment>
