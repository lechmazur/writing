<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (preserving memory, not power) drives every action; "wisely adventurous" trait manifests concretely in sonic solution over brute force. No diagnostic labels—emotions embodied through "humming resonant frequency," "movements precise and certain." Final renunciation (no crown) earns closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: sonic hum parts waterfall → peeling layers reveals map → ruby insertion triggers staircase. Closure (THRONE FILLED ping) delivers conceptual repricing with undeniable cost (dawn’s approach, historical failures). Sunrise deadline anchors orientation early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orchard’s "crystalline trees" and "data-sealer layers" constrain choices—peeling requires sonic precision, not force. Final image ("carrying no crown") charged by recurring "light-curtain" motif. "Ozone and blooming metallophytes" sensory detail reflects urgency; no generic placeholder setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sunrise deadline creates tangible pressure; peeling layers escalates cost through historical failures. Agency lies in methodical layer removal (not combat), narrowing options to the prime layer. Minor deduction: time’s passage affects orchard light but not Elara’s physical strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: "stairway" is signal, not throne, reweighting "sovereignty" as memory restoration. Final image ("saved a future by... remembering its past") resonates without moralizing. No thematic echo—wisdom earned via layered failures and ruby’s click.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "blooming metallophytes" filtered through Lore Keeper’s bias. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("pressed the ruby... chime resonated"). No POV drift; "futuristic nostalgia" modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "tearing silk" simile and "rivers of light" propel momentum. Minor density dip in "deeply futuristic nostalgia" (abstract for peak tension). Final line’s "shimmering veil" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms throne trope: sovereignty requires memory, not ruler. "Palimpsest Pillar" layers ground abstract theme in tactile action. Risk-taking (no physical climb) heightens stakes coherently; avoids derivative AI-purge clichés through specific metallophytes/data-fruit.</comment>
