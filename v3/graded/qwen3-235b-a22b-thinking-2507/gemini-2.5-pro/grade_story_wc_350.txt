<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through "empathetically decisive" trait in the dial-nudging moment; embodied cost in sweat-beaded brow avoids therapy-speak. Slight abstraction in "communal spirit fractured" slightly dilutes flaw-driven urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with unmistakable cost in "sweat beading on his brow" amid restored harmony. Accumulative escalation lacks one palpable intensification beat before the final calibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cuckoo clock weight constrains choice (calibration anchor) and charges closure ("hung perfectly still"); micro-setting elevates to 9-band. Clock tower's spatial choreography slightly vague during high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through linguistic layering under Accumulative lens; agency-driven escalation via Ukrainian poem integration. Fear of isolation needs sharper sensory manifestation beyond auditory descriptions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete linguistic acts ("Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf" → harvest poem), avoiding moralizing. Final "remember how to be bridges" reweights silos without stating moral; "communal spirit" phrasing slightly abstracts stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature crystallizes in technical/poetic duality ("waveform monitor" juxtaposed with "borrowed starlight"). Minor register drift in "psychic repositories" momentarily distances POV during high stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops; "metallic teardrop" metaphor integrates seamlessly with action. "Vigorous and tender" slightly abstract but redeemed by concrete calibration mechanics. Propulsion flawless through high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of C++ commands and folk traditions transforms rural trope; Ukrainian poem grounds universality. Grain elevator premise edges toward familiar decay tropes despite specific execution.</comment>
