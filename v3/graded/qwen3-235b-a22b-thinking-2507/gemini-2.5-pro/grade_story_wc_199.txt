<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes through concrete micro-choices (tweezers handling, spire construction), not internal monologue. Contradictory impulses—quiet precision vs prophetic urgency—manifest in trembling hands during the prod, avoiding diagnostic labels while embodying earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively: the prod’s "distant ice melting" chime triggers ash flaking into viridian wood, reweighting the arbor from memory to "becoming" with visible cost (Elian’s shimmering hands). Accumulative lens holds—each leaf pattern deepens the pattern until the speck’s anomaly forces reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sorting bench’s micro-setting (clay bowls, mica flakes) constrains every choice and charges the finale: moonstone speck placement atop the spire directly enables the transformation. Sensory details (brittle leaf, cool speck) evolve causally with events, avoiding static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the message) tightens through the speck’s arrival, narrowing options to the prod—a choice with immediate, visible cost (ash flaking, moss glowing). Escalation is driven solely by Elian’s agency under the accumulative lens, though the prod lacks resistance beyond anticipation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the final "monumental power of the very, very small" reweights prior seed-sorting labor without moralizing. The jade leaves’ "message of becoming" answers the decoding quest through image, not abstraction, embracing complexity via the arbor’s sorrow-to-renewal arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>Perceptual signature shines in character-particular noticing ("ashen veins," "mossy delight"), with rhythmic control modulating from meditative ("gentle rhythm of falling things") to urgent ("trembling precision"). Zero head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via folklore whispers pays off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels accumulation ("brittle as spun sugar" → "flared with milky light"). Final image’s "residual light" charges closure without figurative muddle. Minor deduction for "viridian green wood" (redundant color descriptor), but propulsion remains impeccable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transforms seed-sorting tropes through hyper-specific mechanics (stem curls, vein patterns) and the skyborne arbor’s ashen logic. Emotional truth in Elian’s quiet joy outweighs surface novelty, though the "prod" climax risks simplicity—but earns distinction via the speck’s causal necessity.</comment>
