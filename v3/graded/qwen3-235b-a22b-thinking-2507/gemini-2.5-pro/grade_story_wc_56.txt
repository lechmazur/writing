<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (truth-seeking vs. emotional cost) embodied through tactile actions like poling and grappling; micro-choices under pressure (prying lid, radio deadline) reveal value hierarchy with visible cost in the serene upheaval realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "upheaval in his soul was vast, yet utterly serene" crystallizes the sacrifice's weight; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through radio deadline tightening and sensory accumulation toward dawn's clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Twilight canal functions as micro-setting constraining every choice (poling resistance, grappling mud); the tarnished sundial charges the final image by transforming from "useless weight" to symbol of faith-based knowing, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten causally as radio static ceases coinciding with discovery, forcing crystallization of Kael's stance; the felt cost of "salvaging history" reshapes his foundation without soft resets, though escalation relies slightly on coincidence (hook catching).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of protective lies emerges organically through blueprints and journal, avoiding moralizing; the final sundial realization reweights "architecture of lies" into sacrifice without stating a moral, satisfying 9+ quick test via non-literal dawn imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("water the color of a day-old bruise") filters urgency through Kael's tactile focus; rhythmic control shifts from slow poling cadence to grappling intensity, with patterned elision (grandfather's backstory) taught early and paid off in journal reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("static hissing," "dead, unyielding weight of iron") propels momentum, though "surfacing leviathan" metaphor risks slight overwriting in high-pressure beat without full payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "errant legend seeker" trope via architectural stakes and tactile truth-finding; the "architecture of lies" concept avoids abstraction through specific blueprints/journal, though emotional complexity lacks deeper friction beyond the central sacrifice.</comment>
