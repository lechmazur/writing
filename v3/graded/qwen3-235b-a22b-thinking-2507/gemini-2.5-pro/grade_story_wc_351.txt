<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") is clear and drives action, but internal contradiction (preserving chaos vs. risking self-dissolution) lacks embodied friction until climax; "helix-minded" trait remains descriptive rather than shaping micro-choices under pressure until the neural rewrite sequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the tear on the mirror crystallizes cost (identity fragmentation risk) and reconfiguration ("world irrevocably enriched"); Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density escalates toward the symphony’s arrival, with moonlight-to-tear imagery charging the final cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon functions as micro-setting: "pages of stone" and "silver ink" constrain perception and charge the climax when the mirror’s reflection shifts from Elara’s eyes to entangled memories; conductive gel’s tactile presence (tear tracing through it) directly charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving dreams without self-annihilation) tightens through neural rewrite escalation; the cost (identity fragmentation risk during synaptic remapping) is viscerally felt in "tide of sorrow... threatening to pull her under," but pressure relies heavily on internal conflict without external constraint deepening the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging "abandoned dreams" emerges through concrete particulars (shipwright’s hands, composer’s symphony), culminating in the non-literal answer of the sunset symphony blooming behind Elara’s eyelids; avoids moralizing by making the cost (self-dissolution risk) inseparable from the victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Distinct perceptual signature shines in helix-minded logic ("spiral connections, echoes folding back") and sensory compression under stress (ozone/synthetic lavender during neural lace connection); lyrical elision ("swimming through a storm of ghosts") is taught early and paid off in the final symphony’s visceral charge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("She initiated the sequence, and the machine began its work through synaptic plasticity") but "chaotically precise" appears twice as near-synonym label without evolving tradeoffs, slightly dulling the neural rewrite’s stakes in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ingenuity in fusing neurotech with poetic salvage creates fresh emotional truth; "helix-minded engineer" transforms the trope through specific stakes (synaptic remapping as archeology), but the moonlit canyon setting leans on familiar desert-mysticism without fully avoiding archetype.</comment>
