<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("pride demanded elegance" vs duty to save prince) manifests physically in labyrinth manipulation; epiphany earned through concrete tapestry analysis without therapy-speak. Slight emotional tidiness in resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: "quiet, aching relief of a truce" crystallizes the thematic shift. Accumulative lens holds through thread-decoding pattern; orientation anchored by 80 words ("petrified stone lip").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (fingers mirror insights) and charges closure (cool solved sphere in palm). Tapestry threads evolve from background to tactical tool without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Elias's agency decoding threads; cost legible in "aching relief" and physical unraveling. Deepening reweights guilt into wisdom under accumulative lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess/tapestry metaphor: final line reframes forgiveness as "wisdom to begin the next game" without moralizing. Rain and solved labyrinth embody earned wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "gut-shaking peal," "chaotic tangle of frayed border" reflect chess tutor's analytical bias. Rhythm modulates from measured analysis to staccato climax ("soft, final click") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops; "million held breaths" simile achieves high density. Minor deduction for "fierce repose" slightly overwrought but compensated by precise closure verbs ("unraveled," "struck hot iron"). No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms frozen-time trope through specific chess/tapestry mechanics; "frayed border as cipher" feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids therapeutic templates while risk-taking (accumulative structure) heightens stakes.</comment>
