<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "flawed copy" confrontation, but advisor's silence lacks prior setup. Embodied emotion ("throat like a lie") avoids diagnostic labels. Micro-choices like avoiding reflections reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "curse now feeling less like a wound" crystallizes cost of embracing void. Accumulative lens holds—luminance density peaks at mirror dissolution. Minor deduction: "unbosom" physicality underdeveloped in climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Funhouse constrains choices (warped mirrors force indirect navigation), clasp charges final image. Avoids white-room syndrome with "sagging padded pendulums" and "rot-eaten heart." Slight ornamental drift in "ethereal glow" description prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sensory density: luminance shifts from "ghosts of sugar" to "cleansing fire." Protagonist's agency in baiting Fear ("give the monster what it wants") drives conceptual reversal. Cost unmistakable in "truer emptiness" reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through clasp's transformation—screaming moth to weapon—without moralizing. Final line reweights void as strength, avoiding thematic echo. Complexity shines in Fear's defeat via incompleteness, no false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie") defines voice. Rhythm modulates from languid to staccato during confrontation. Minor deduction: "repulsive allure" repetition in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "phantom tinkle of a dropped prize" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Density flawless until "repulsive allure" repetition in climax. No figurative muddle—metaphors serve pressure ("frantic bird in a cage of bone").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Transforms horror tropes via specific logic: Fear defeated by incompleteness, void as anchor. "Unbosom the break" synthesizes emotional truth with fresh inflection. Avoids derivative safety with bold emptiness-as-weapon resolution.</comment>
