<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interiority relies on poetic abstraction ("distilled emotion," "indistinguishable from grief") rather than embodied contradiction; epiphany lacks struggle against competing impulses. Final realization feels earned but lacks visceral micro-choices during the hum's escalation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "She was the destination" crystallizes the central conflict with undeniable conceptual cost ("the weight of a crown"). Orientation succeeds early, though the gramophone's purpose feels slightly deus ex machina without deeper setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sepia reading room’s sensory details (decaying paper, golden shadows) vividly anchor the scene but function primarily as atmosphere. Micro-setting triumph: the crank handle’s tactile coolness in the final image charges closure by transforming its meaning from key to testament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes ("uncover a hidden truth") are clear and personal, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation—only one intensification (hum rising to "pressure that could crack glass"). Agency is passive reception; no trade-offs narrow options before the revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "dynasty ender" concept, avoiding moralizing. Final image ("silence was no longer the sound of searching, but the eloquent sound of being found") delivers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question with profound conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shines ("golden shadows against her eyelids seemed to deepen and coalesce"), though "distilled emotion" verges on abstract label-speak. Rhythmic control under pressure is masterful; no head-hopping in this single-POV lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise, with zero loops or scaffold. Minor flaw: "distilled emotion" in the climax borders on label-speak, slightly dulling the revelation’s immediacy. Final image ("novel lightness") avoids cliché through concrete context.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms the "family secret" trope through the standing-wave mechanism and self-sacrificial legacy. Emotional specificity ("love so fierce it was indistinguishable from grief") avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking in sound-based revelation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
