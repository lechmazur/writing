<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority shines through embodied thermal metaphors ("jagged, searing orange"), but "unshaken marvels" borders on thematic statement. Final choice earned via cereus interaction, though "silently expressive" trait lacks tested tradeoffs under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: trauma transformed into "radiant color" with visible cost ("exhaustion settling into her bones"). Accumulative lens holds perfectly; thermal tapestry escalation narrows options to a single, resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting—frosted panes become her "score," constraining the climax. Misses 9+ gate as environment doesn’t alter tactics earlier, though thermal choreography ("violet light spilled across the winterglass") charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen organically through sensory escalation: trauma intrusion raises cost, but "rectify the world’s silence" remains slightly abstract. Agency is clear (weaving colors), yet the dominant stake could feel more viscerally threatened pre-climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through action—silence as "space where new music could begin" avoids moralizing. Nearly flawless, but final line risks thematic echo; wisdom arises from cereus bloom’s "pearlescent white," not abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature via thermal POV ("incandescent violet emanating from the bud") with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; lyrical compression taught early ("phantom roar that now had no voice") pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion, but paraphrase loop ("deep exhaustion... equally profound peace") slightly dulls momentum. Zero figurative muddle; "shimmering violet" sustains clarity even in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma/transformation via heat-mapping device avoids tropes. Risk-taking (silence as compositional space) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "capsize survivor" archetype lacks novelty. Emotional specificity anchors universality.</comment>
