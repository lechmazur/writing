<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines when scientific tuning fails and intuitive memory-driven adjustment succeeds; embodied emotion ("tasting sharp metallic anger") avoids therapy-speak while revealing character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: diary opens but remains unread, honoring privacy as fireworks explode; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as sensory density tightens options without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Micro-setting (copper calipers, brass clasp) constrains every choice and charges the final image; "sun-warmed stone" memory transforms tactile detail into emotional stakes during climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Time pressure from fireworks' "pre-emptive thud" narrows options organically; Elias' shift from measured tuning to intuitive leap demonstrates agency-driven escalation with visible cost (ignoring machine, closing eyes).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: empathy via preserved silence (not reading diary) reweights "path to empathy" without moralizing; final image makes conceptual cost undeniable as chaos frames quiet devotion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("tasting colors," "mournful blue sound") creates rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from theatrical ("my dear") to reverent ("sun-warmed stone") without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zero loops; "sculpted void" crystallizes abstract concept through concrete image; final line ("roaring chaos... preserved quiet") achieves high density without figurative muddle in peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "grandma's diary" trope via sonic archaeology of silence; risk-taking (pacifism as active empathy) heightens stakes without gimmickry, though "eclectic" descriptor lacks deeper integration.</comment>
