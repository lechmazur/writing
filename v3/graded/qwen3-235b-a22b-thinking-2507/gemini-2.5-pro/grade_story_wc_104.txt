<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "body bound/purpose free" closure, but internal conflict lacks visible struggle during key action; strategic calm edges toward over-calibration without irrational layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: arrow→key sequence→defense cascade creates irreversible option narrowing. Earned Stasis closure lands with visceral cost ("body bound, purpose free") crystallizing the chain's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carnival prizes actively constrain choices (bears as barricades, tickets as hazards), transforming micro-setting into tactical weapon. Piano bench rotting velvet charges the key-discovery beat with embodied history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: decoding keys directly impedes enforcers, with visible cost (remaining chained). Pressure escalates via causal chain, though enforcers' off-page presence slightly softens visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete action: "planting resilience in dry soil" manifests as scattering seeds, with final image reweighting chains as generative soil without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Perceptual signature excels ("vacant eyes" of plush toys, "shuddering groans" of wall), but "profound stillness of a patiently strategic mind" veers toward diagnostic labeling mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dust-filled light illuminating calm face" achieves lyrical density without muddle. "Staggering grace" slightly elevates register for peak stress but avoids full drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms liberation trope via chained strategist; carnival mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes through whimsical yet tactical defense system without gimmickry.</comment>
