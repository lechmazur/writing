<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's micro-choices (trusting the bell) show embodied contradiction, but Kaelen's cynicism lacks depth and the ghost's motivation remains told, not pressured through action. Missing interior conflict in pivotal moments keeps it strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as decisive change with felt cost ("leaving the lonely guardian"), but the ghost's sudden "selfless spirit" reveal lacks causal buildup. Orientation is clear early, yet the climb's difficulty isn't leveraged as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Red dust and arches create vivid atmosphere, but the biodome's strangler figs serve as decorative symbolism rather than constraining choices. The bell charges the final image effectively, yet micro-setting details like the water purifier aren't fully integrated into pressure points.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape) is signaled early with one tightening (the climb), but the ghost's convenient guidance removes authentic tension. Stakes feel abstract—no personal cost beyond dread—until the final departure, where emotional weight arrives too late to deepen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" motif resonates through figs/bell without moralizing, and the final image reweights it as purpose. However, the altruistic ghost feels thematically convenient, lacking complexity in his sacrifice that could create meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature ("dust tasted like rust") and rhythmic control, but dialogue lacks distinct voices—Kaelen's grumble and Elara's murmurs share identical emotional cadence under pressure. Minor psychic distance slip with "the ghost watched" slightly disrupts focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with purposeful rhythm, though "symphony of desperation" edges into overwriting. No major loops, but "cruel joke" is a stock phrase that dilutes the bell's discovery beat without adding pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "butterfly bell as tuning fork" transforms the magic object trope, and emotional specificity in the found family elevates it. However, the altruistic ghost remains derivative, missing the risk-taking needed for higher bands despite strong execution.</comment>
