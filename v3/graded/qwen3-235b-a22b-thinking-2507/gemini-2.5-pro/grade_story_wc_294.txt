<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines through Elias's calm vs inherited violence; embodied emotion in "air tasted of rust" and handling of bolivar. Final renunciation of cyclical hunger feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in his hard-won stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "paths of ravenous hunger... consumed themselves" reweights premise with undeniable cost in the folded bolivar. Causal escalation holds perfectly—markers directly narrow CEO's options, making departure inevitable under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train isn't backdrop but tactical constraint: supplies mask/music box/paint for resistance. Final "silent, reclaimed woods" charges closure through micro-setting specificity—leather satchel's return crystallizes the thematic cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven entirely by Elias's agency: territorial markers deepen workers' unease until CEO confrontation. Cost is legible in "primal unease" chipping confidence and the conceptual price of understanding cyclical violence, foreclosing both father's/startup's paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: Venezuelan bolivar folding reweights "dusky harmony" without moralizing. Avoids anti-patterns—the final image ("quiet... harmony of what remains") resonates as non-literal answer to "why paths circle back," embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("fluorescent vests an insult to muted greens") and rhythmic control under pressure: CEO scene uses short, sharp phrases ("He didn't confess or threaten") while calm moments breathe. No head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly with stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "dusky harmony" motif avoids overuse through concrete embodiment. Final line ("road not taken") recharges closure without muddle. Slight register drift in "ravenous hunger" risks thematic echo but saved by immediate bolivar imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms gentrification trope via circus-specific resistance (clown mask, acrobat's slipper). Emotional truth in "primal unease" over cartoonish fear. Risk-taking (currency as thematic anchor) heightens stakes without gimmickry, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
