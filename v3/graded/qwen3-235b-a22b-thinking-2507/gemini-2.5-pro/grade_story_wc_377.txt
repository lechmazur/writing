<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority shows embodied contradiction (silence as space filled with symphonies), but lacks micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values beyond the single focus. Motivation is clear but insufficiently conflicted under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis with undeniable cost (sculpture's self-destruction), anchored by Accumulative/Textural lens where sonic density reweights wonder's value. Wind's arrival and final image crystallize pressure without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ice constrains every choice (thermal chisels, melting cost) and charges the final image (glistening vapor). Sensory details like "frozen tears" and "keening wind" are selective, character-filtered, and evolve causally with the sculpture's dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving wonder) tighten through the sculpture's construction and inevitable melting, with visible cost in the vapor. Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under Accumulative lens, though pressure lacks a mid-scene reversal beyond the wind's arrival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action (ice-to-sound transformation), avoiding moralizing. Final image—"gaze searching the horizon"—resonantly answers the central question by showing wonder's renewal as ongoing labor, not a tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature shines in texture-driven diction ("veined with deep, frozen blues," "thrumming faintly against his palms"). Rhythmic control modulates from "economical movements" to crescendo's "thousand brilliant points of fire" without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; high density in phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "deliberate self-destruction." Minor overwriting risk in "thin as frozen tears," but metaphor serves character-specific perception without muddling causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "artist as preserver" trope through ice-sculpture mechanics and muteness-as-tool. Freshness lies in wonder as sonic resonance, but avoids risk-taking beyond premise—no structural boldness to justify 9+ distinction.</comment>
