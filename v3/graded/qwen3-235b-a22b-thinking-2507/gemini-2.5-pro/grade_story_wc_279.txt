<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("discover meaning in the mess") is clear and embodied through sand art, with socially perceptive trait shown via reading body language. Lacks contradictory impulses in peak beats; closure choice (mandala creation) earned but internal conflict remains surface-level. "Lilac unease" label slightly undermines embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fragile shared focus over the mandala reconfigures meaning amid silence with undeniable conceptual cost ("hush remained unbroken... yet something shifted"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup. Minor escalation weakness—the tile discovery doesn't significantly narrow options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering grotto's acoustics (now "echoes that lost their sources") and tile flake directly constrain choices, forcing nonverbal communication. Micro-setting (sand texture on knees) charges closure. Sensory details like "lavender-grey shroud" and "gritty texture" are purposeful, though "lilac unease" borders on thematic repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning) tightens through Elara's shift from observation to mandala creation, altering group dynamics. Cost is legible in the enduring hush despite connection. Escalation driven by agency under accumulative lens, but stakes lack visceral weight—conceptual cost (enduring silence) insufficient for 8.8+ band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through sand mandala's chaos/gold patterns and tile placement, avoiding direct statement. Final image ("fragile, shared focus") offers resonant non-literal answer to "meaning in mess." "Lilac unease" repetition risks thematic echo, but earned through concrete particulars like the woman relaxing her posture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("paint-stained fingers," "lilac unease") with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats ("knelt... poured"). Single POV stable; diction compresses under pressure ("soundless scream held in the collective throat"). Minor register drift with "emergent hush" jargon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High density with "lavender-grey shroud" texture, but "lilac unease" appears three times—borderline paraphrase loop dulling closure image. "Soundless scream" slightly purple, yet final paragraph avoids overwriting. No scaffold in pivotal beats, but repetition triggers -0.3 per band guidance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of "unlearning" as societal silence reframed through sand art. Transformation test passed: swapping "chalk artist" for "painter" would weaken ephemerality theme. Risk-taking in quiet closure earned through grotto/tile specificity, though "lilac unease" verges on familiar motif.</comment>
