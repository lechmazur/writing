<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied motivation ("wilder thread into the tapestry") but lacks contradictory impulses during ritual execution; flawless plant communication under pressure feels unearned without struggle, weakening micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with conceptual cost ("seed that would grow in the cracks"), but Elara's zero physical cost during high-stakes unsealing creates minor causality drift under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Volcanic springs function as active micro-setting: thermophilic algae and basalt shelf directly constrain choices (enzyme release, temperature control), charging the final "churning water" image with environmental necessity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Stakes escalate through agency-driven environmental manipulation, but the conceptual cost ("implanted destiny") remains abstract without a tangible forfeiture; lacks visceral price paid during the ritual beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through "wilder thread" imagery and the embryo's biological imperative; final line reweights reconstruction as "sterile foundation" without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silent green-and-red consciousness") shines, but stress response lacks syntactic compression—no shortening of diction during the unsealing climax weakens rhythmic pressure modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "nascent destiny held in stasis" is the sole borderline-purple phrase in peak beats, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise crystalline propulsion and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Transforms rebellion trope through botanical specificity (kite script as biological recipe), but "reconstruction" framework edges toward familiar dystopian shorthand without deeper societal texture.</comment>
