<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation clear but slightly told; embodied choices under pressure compensate. Micro-turns during drone deployment showcase value hierarchy. Final endurance of planetary memory feels earned. Minor lack of prior struggle lowers to 8.7.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is flawless Conceptual Repricing: "memory of strength" reweights premise with undeniable cost in the ailing trees. Causal lens holds through inversion mechanics. Orientation clear by line 5 with orchard planet anchor. No flaws in pressure escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard planet's inverted river constrains all navigation choices and charges the final shard image. Sensory details selective (dust motes, humming bone resonance). "Ochre soil" slightly generic but offset by crystalline droplets' specificity. Environment essential to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes signaled immediately with blight; inversion window forces irreversible narrowing of options. Gravity reclamation creates visible cost (racing minutes) that alters tactics. Agency-driven escalation under causal lens. No coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges purely through particulars: arrow tip's purpose twist reframes resilience as collective memory. Final image reweights "cure" into "memory" without moralizing. Seed pod growth shows concept; no abstraction. Non-literal answer resonates beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("humming in teeth and bones") persists under stress. Syntax modulates with pressure (short phrases during drone deployment). "Whirling silence" motif deepens tone without cliché. Consistent close-third POV throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("soundless noise" justified by inversion). Figurative language sparse and purposeful ("weightless ballet"). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting. Minor "ochre soil" vagueness prevents 9.5.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: "gathering of echoes" as life-force memory transforms ecological trope. Arrow tip's marker-purpose twist grows from established pattern. Risk-taking (gravity inversion mechanics) heightens stakes coherently. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
