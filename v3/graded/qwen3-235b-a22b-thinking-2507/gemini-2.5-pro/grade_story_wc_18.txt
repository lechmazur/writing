<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation rooted in tactile grief ("fragile, desperate thing" slightly abstract), embodied emotion via frozen tear, but minimal internal contradiction during pivotal breathwork; micro-choices (breath pacing) reveal value hierarchy under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: shattering frost mountains crystallize the cost of ephemeral vision ("boundary... erased... with nothing more"), Accumulative lens holds through breath-frost symbiosis; orientation anchors within 40 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fog/frost actively constrains action (erasing sound/sun, enabling crystallization); "petrified stump" and obsidian mirror charge the final image; micro-setting (frost filigree on branches) mirrors lunar landscape with purposeful specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (recreating stolen dream) tighten through breath-controlled frost formation; escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens; cost is visceral in the mountains' shattering ("fracture line... spider's thread") and her tear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "erasing boundaries" motif reweighted by closure: the dream shifts from "runaway" to "map she now knew how to read" without moralizing; lunar highlands as glass mountains avoid symbolic convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature (glassmaker’s tactile focus: "silica and heat," "steady hand"); rhythmic breath cadence modulates under pressure; minor register drift in "bruised twilight" but lyric compression taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zero loops; "silver filigree tracing dead apple branches" exemplifies textural specificity; slight overwriting in "fragile, desperate thing" for motivation, but final line ("map she now knew how to read") delivers propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomy/glassmaking through "glass mountains" motif; transforms "erasing boundaries" from theme to actionable method; risk-taking (breath as sculpting tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
