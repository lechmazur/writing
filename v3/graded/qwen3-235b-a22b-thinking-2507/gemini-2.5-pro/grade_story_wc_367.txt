<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction (joy vs. unintended consequences) is embodied through action and micro-choices like lever adjustments, but emotional progression lacks messy irrationality—shift from manic laughter to quiet wonder feels tidied without sufficient friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "dawn was beginning to shape him too" reweights reality-shaping with conceptual cost (loss of control over art's meaning). Accumulative lens holds via storm density increase and dawn's pattern break, though minor causality gaps in prophecy mechanics slightly weaken escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Glass wick constrains choices (angle adjustments steer storm) and charges final resonance, but lighthouse setting remains atmospheric backdrop—no physical pressure on tactics despite vivid cosmic imagery. Micro-setting succeeds; macro-setting lacks active constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through storm escalation (density increase) with visible cost (exhaustion, unintended prophecies), but conflict lacks visceral trade-offs—Kaelan's physical strain outweighs the abstract conceptual cost of misinterpreted art, slightly muting the dominant stake's urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete actions (joy misread as divine writ), with final image offering non-literal answer to art's autonomy. Lacks meaningful ambiguity—the insight "art shapes artist" resolves neatly without counter-readings that would deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("bruise of violet," "symphony of chaos") and rhythmic control modulating with storm intensity. Minor register drift in "nascent energy drawn down" slightly jars, but compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with resonant final line, but scaffold phrases ("his domain, his cathedral") and near-duplicate ("forgotten tongues") create minor momentum drag. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though "cosmic clouds" feels generic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of optical physics (total internal reflection) with mythic heraldry creates organic originality. "Accidentally prophetic" twist transforms tropes through specific stakes, though "Laughing Storm Herald" archetype lacks deeper personalization to push into 9.0+.</comment>
