<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in "quietly enthusiastic" vs "stellar doubt," with embodied cost in "pit of his stomach tightened." Final realization earned through coin ritual micro-choices, though prophecy text risks retroactive convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "slumped into chair" to "profound certainty" reconfigures his life's purpose. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; static's fracturing into memory delivers irreversible stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ambered field and static bursts create visceral texture, but observatory deck remains backdrop rather than constraint. Copper coin as micro-setting charges closure by reweighting "uncoint the void," though spatial choreography lacks pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("prophet or madman?") tightens via sensor-burnout risk, with visible cost in physical tension. Agency through coin ritual drives escalation; the signal's fracture reweights options under Accumulative pressure without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through "distilled memory" rather than moralizing. Final image—"voices of a billion ghosts"—resonantly answers "wavelength align" without abstraction, avoiding thematic echo despite prophecy text's late payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature ("bruised light," "screaming physics") embodies Kael's scientific lyricism. Rhythmic control peaks in signal-processing scene: "static bursts simply grew louder" compresses tension without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless propulsion: "He was about to cut the power when the noise fractured" avoids scaffolding. Minor synonym churn in "distill the chaos, teasing out phantom signals" costs 0.2, but closure beat remains artifact-free.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforms apocalypse trope through memory-as-cosmos. "Uncoint the void" synthesizes coins, prophecy, and static into inevitable risk-taking. Specificity of Sol coin and orchestra tuning avoids generic "echo" clichés.</comment>
