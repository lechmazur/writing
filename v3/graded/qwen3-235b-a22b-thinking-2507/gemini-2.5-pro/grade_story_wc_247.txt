<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority leans abstract ("joyful sorrow" told not shown); Lyra's memory lacks concrete history to ground contradictions. Final choice earned but micro-choices under pressure feel sparse during climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "oppressive weight lifted... replaced by melody" reconfigures silence with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Harbor setting actively constrains choices: corroded pylons dictate camera angles, waterlogged bench triggers specific gestures. Final image ("silence no longer empty") charges the environment with earned transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate organically from "deep sorrowful quiet" to "active, aggressive" silence. Elian's agency drives each deepening ("Deeper... Find the place") with palpable cost in the final "sorrow of loss/joy of music" synthesis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: sign language as "conversing with silence," rotted lovers' initials. Final image ("unending song") reweights "forgotten echoes" without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice mastery: "ripple sheet of silver" and "silken thread in cold air" show character-specific perception. Rhythm mirrors Elian's movements (slow curves vs sharp gestures) with zero head-hopping under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Near-flawless density; "low resonant chord seemed to hum up from pilings" achieves triple duty. One slight overwriting slip ("desperate, beautiful ballet") prevents 9.0.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "haunted harbor" trope through specific mechanics (filmless camera as divining rod). Risk-taking heightens stakes: sign language notation feels inevitable yet fresh, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
