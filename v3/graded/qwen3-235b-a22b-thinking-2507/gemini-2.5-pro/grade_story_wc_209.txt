<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines in her artistic/public vs. internal/search life, but the "obsession" lacks concrete struggle; micro-choices like filter selection reveal values without sufficient friction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "world poised in quiet intake of breath" crystallizes her internal shift with visible cost (abandoned solitude for cosmic purpose), under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens where density peaks at the portrait reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cathedral window’s glass layers function as micro-setting that constrains choices (filter angles) and charges the final image ("amber memory connected to silvery revelation"), though the snowmelt timeframe lacks tactile integration with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation through layered discoveries deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, but the snowmelt timeframe ("winter's last snow") remains atmospheric rather than tightening tactics; cost (worldview transformation) is felt but not visibly altering immediate choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: night-blooming flowers reweight from biological curiosity to metaphor for strength in darkness, resolved non-literally through the cosmic roots portrait; avoids moralizing while charging the final mural vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("amber pavilion," "bruised sky") modulates with discovery intensity; rhythmic control peaks in the filter sequence ("violet-filtered light," "silver lines feeding roots"), with zero POV slippage despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No scaffold loops or figurative muddle; "umbral tenderness" slightly risks preciousness but earns weight through context. Final line’s "cosmic roots and starlit blossoms" delivers crystalline propulsion without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms the "hidden portrait" trope through specific botanist/glass-artisan fusion; "flowers bloom at night as declaration of strength" synthesizes theme and character with emotional truth, avoiding derivative safety.</comment>
