<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interiority avoids therapy-speak ("hollowed out by grief" not "I feel depressed"), but reaper occupation lacks specificity affecting choices; micro-choice with prism shows value hierarchy yet flaw (inability to heal) doesn't compound decisions during ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "he did not feel healed... but the nameless fear now had a shape" crystallizes endurance with conceptual cost; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density (light/dust/sound) reweights grief without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism (tool) constrains the ritual and charges the final image ("scar given form"), but observatory setting remains atmospheric backdrop; copper ribs and Orrery supply resources yet fail to actively pressure choices beyond light source.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through Kael's ritual attempt (one meaningful deepening), with cost legible in "a reaper cannot heal"; agency drives escalation via prism/light manipulation, though grief's weight could further narrow options beyond the single crystallization attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (atlas monsters → named grief), avoiding moralizing; final image reweights "starlight is memory of dead fire" into tangible scar without stating moral, though "drowning fear now had a shape" edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("copper-ribbed skeleton," "sun bled out") filters cosmos through grief; rhythmic control modulates under pressure (fragmented phrases during ritual), with no head-hopping or register drift despite lyrical compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero synonym loops or scaffold; "dust motes ceased their dance" shows via action, not tells; only borderline cliché ("physical amputation") avoided fatal overwriting, with propulsion maintained through varied sentence rhythms in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transforms grief ritual trope via reaper mythology and tangible echo crystallization; emotional specificity ("weary sighs, whispered forgotten phrases") avoids generality, with bold structural choice to make sacrifice the core engine rather than a backstory detail.</comment>
