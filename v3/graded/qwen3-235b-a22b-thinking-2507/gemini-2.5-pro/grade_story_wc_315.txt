<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction shines via muscle memory ritual calming tremors under pressure; embodied "hollow ache" post-crisis avoids tidy resolution. Flaw: minor abstraction in "preserve trust" without immediate friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: static clearing → pattern shift → recalibration creates tight because/therefore chain. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost in "soundless echo" reweighting silence's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Parachute buckle constrains choice (steadies hand) and charges final image; bioluminescent moss/ozone sensory details narrow under crisis. Micro-setting functions as environment per 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes materialize viscerally through trembling hand on crystal dial; "silent defense" trade-off forecloses panic option. Agency-driven escalation via power diversion schematic narrows options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: buckle ritual embodies "preserve trust," final image rejects moralizing with "oblivious and safe" resonance. Avoids thematic echo despite high conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature distinct: "ghost in the glass" reflection, "roaring deafness" sensory compression. Rhythmic control peaks in "Click, pull, check" muscle memory cadence during crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Zero loops; "hair-thin ring of spun crystal" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor filter verb ("felt like a physical weight") doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion peaks in calibration sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transforms "watcher" trope via parachute buckle's physical role; risk-taking in quiet crisis resolution. Fresh inflection: recalibration as "silent scream" reconfigures vigilance concept.</comment>
