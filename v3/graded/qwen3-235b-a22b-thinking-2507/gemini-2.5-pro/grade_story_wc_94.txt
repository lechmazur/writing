<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("furiously tranquil") embodied through "statue of calm" vs "screaming hurricane"; final key choice earned by timer countdown. Slight over-articulation in "boil away fury" risks diagnostic label-speak but redeemed by physical trembling reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure as Charged Poise: "vigil wasn't an ending; it was a darkroom" crystallizes stance with visible cost (dissolved tranquility). Orientation flawless by 50 words. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) held consistently through rhythmic escalation to the *ping*.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Observatory as active constraint: telescope's locked panel requires the key, timetable functions as literal map. Final city light recharges "stormlit thought" skull imagery while altering tactics—environment directly charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through timer's countdown ("masks slip" timeframe), narrowing options to envelope decision. Fury release after *ping* shows visible cost, but "cartography of scars" motivation could deepen tactical friction earlier in pressure sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through darkroom metaphors: "rarefy," "develop," "undeveloped negative" reweight "scars" into active journey. Final image rejects mapping past for confronting it—resonant without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("sea of clouds churned, silently blasted") modulates with stress: long lyrical sentences fracture into staccato beats during timer countdown. Zero head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; "mechanical heartbeat measuring silence between thunder's rumble" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight density risk in "acid of his memories" metaphor but redeemed by contextual precision in high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transforms "censored poet" trope through specific darkroom logic; bus timetable as map feels inevitable. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off, though "photographer's ghost" borders on familiar motif without sufficient fresh inflection.</comment>
