1) Executive profile

Across Q1–Q8, the model’s center of gravity is Track A: single POV, accumulative/textural builds, one meaningful tightening and a clear on-page closure with cost. It teaches pattern early, sustains a coherent drive-lens to the end, and lands endings via charged images or micro-choices rather than expository turns. Strengths cluster around embodied character work, causally integrated settings, and voice cohesion; the prose carries layered images and rhythmic control that add pressure without muddling clarity. Closure is typically reliable and legible: resonant reconfiguration, earned stasis, or decisive change, often marked by an irreversible act or renunciation that reweights motif and premise.

Limitations appear when pressure stays gentle, cost is asserted conceptually rather than manifested on the page, or line-level habits intrude at climax (diagnostic labels, elevated diction, redundancy). Theme risks final-paragraph overstatement; conflict can plateau into atmosphere rather than strategic narrowing; occasional lens or register drift can tax orientation or immediacy. Track B/C entries generally hold when segmentation is taught; failures arise when mosaics drift from stakes or disorientation isn’t purposeful. Net effect on the reader: high clarity and momentum with felt resonance in the best work, occasionally blunted by soft escalation or abstracted closure.

2) Portfolio map

Q1 Character — Strong · Embodied micro-choices under pressure drive earned change

Q2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Accumulative lens taught early; on‑page cost at closure

Q3 Setting — Strong · Environment constrains tactics and charges the final image

Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Pressure sometimes gentle; escalation plateaus without narrowing

Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Strong image-led subtext; risks explicit final statements

Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Stable psychic distance; taught compression and rhythmic control

Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Layered sentences; minor redundancy and abstraction spikes

Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Fresh syntheses; some transplantable frames and safe resolutions

3) Signature moves

- Character-defining micro-choices that crystallize stance and cost at the end.
- Accumulative patterning: ritual or motif density builds to a single pattern-break.
- Setting as mechanism: tools/objects constrain choice and reweight closure.
- Voice as engine: syntax modulates with pressure; prose filters through character bias.
- Charged final images that imply theme without stating it: “the final image of silence felt like a beginning.”
- Concrete cost on-page via renunciation or endurance: “leaving the rope... with full understanding of its weight.”

4) Failure modes

- Conceptual closure without on-page cost: asserted loss rather than a visible price paid.
- Escalation plateaus: atmospheric pressure replaces strategic narrowing and adaptation.
- Orientation lag beyond ~120 words without payoff; untaught lens switches midstream.
- Line-level intrusions at peak beats: therapy-speak, filter-verb clusters, elevated/academic diction.
- Thematic echo in final lines—moral stated outright, undercutting earned ambiguity.
- Track-test wobbles in mosaics: >4 shards feel untaught; segmentation drifts from stakes.

5) When it shines / when it breaks

It shines when the story anchors in a constrained micro-setting, teaches the accumulative lens early, and lets a single, protagonist-driven act reconfigure everything. Motifs return as tools, not ornaments; the voice stays character-particular under stress; and the final image makes the cost legible without explanation. Under these conditions, momentum tightens, clarity holds, and resonance persists.

It breaks when conflict remains textural without tactical consequence, when reflection exceeds ~30% without present-time anchoring or micro-choices, or when closure leans on conceptual summary. Untaught formal shifts, late orientation, or cadence loops in the final third sap pressure. Familiar frames that could survive a setting swap (mentor saves community, tidy uplift) dull ingenuity and felt stakes.

6) Keep vs. adjust

• Keep:
- Embodied interiority through concrete micro-choices and sensory-motivated action.
- Early pattern teaching with accumulative builds to a single, decisive pattern-break.
- Voice cohesion: rhythmic modulation and POV-consistent diction under pressure.

• Adjust:
- Make cost provable on the page: one sentence/image where the price is paid.
- Add a mid-story obstacle or failed tactic to prevent plateau and force adaptation.
- Strip peak-beat abstractions and thematic summaries; replace with object-level action or image that implies meaning.
