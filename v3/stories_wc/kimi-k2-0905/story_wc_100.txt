The weary undertaker’s hands trembled as he slit the wax seal on the package that had arrived without postmark or return address. [18]
Inside lay a shard of broken lighthouse lens, its glass fogged like the eyes of the many dead he had dressed for viewing. [31]
A folded note accompanied it: “Distress signals still flash where no surface light can reach—come revitalize the drowned address of rest.” [46]
Inadvertently stubborn, he had refused every prior summons to the coast, preferring the predictable hush of his inland parlor; yet this fragment tugged at him like an unpaid debt to the departed. [68]
That night he dreamed of books breathing underwater and awoke with salt on his lips, convinced the lens shard was a ticket to a funeral that had been waiting for him since before his birth. [90]
He traveled to the condemned pier, descended the rusted service ladder, and followed the faint pulse blooming within the glass—occupying impossible spaces between tide and time. [113]
At the ocean floor a current parted, revealing boulevards of barnacled marble: the forgotten underwater city library, its dome cracked open like a skull that could no longer keep its secrets. [140]
Shelves of swollen volumes lined the boulevards, their spines aligned like processional candles; the undertaker drifted between them, feet brushing silt that had once been reading tables. [169]
He located the main catalog, a brass octopus whose tentacles pointed toward stacks according to moon-phase dials; the lens shard glowed hotter whenever he faced the northeast aisle. [199]
There he found a card labeled “Perpetual Repose, Volume Infinity,” shelved between “Nautical Star Charts” and “Lullabies for the Unborn.” [222]
When he opened the book, pages of compacted salt unfurled into corridors, each sentence a doorway occupying impossible spaces no coffin had ever truly offered. [248]
He understood then that the city had been built by librarians who cataloged every unmoored soul; the broken lighthouse lens had once crowned the dome, projecting distress signals toward the living whenever the collection grew too heavy. [282]
But the lens cracked during a quake, the beam faltered, and the dead accumulated like overdue fines, their whispers eroding foundations until the entire library sank, still aching for checkout. [315]
The undertaker, weary yet inadvertently stubborn, pressed the shard into the empty bezel; the metal accepted it with a maternal click, yet the glass remained fractured, leaking only bruised glimmers. [348]
To revitalize the signal he needed amplification, so he tore pages from “Perpetual Repose,” folding them into paper boats that carried names he remembered from every hillside grave he had ever tended. [378]
He set the flotilla ablaze with his pocket lighter, an underwater conflagration that burned cold, feeding on memory instead of oxygen; the fire translated grief into light the way a prism translates sun into rainbow. [412]
The lens drank the glow, cracks sealing with phosphorescent scars; a column of chased stillness rose, neither sound nor silence but the interval between heartbeats when the dearly departed almost speak. [443]
Distress signals surged upward, a morse of moonlit bubbles that broke the surface and scattered across night sky like new constellations charting the address of rest. [470]
Books throughout the library sighed shut, their contents now stamped RETURNED; the undertaker felt the water warm as countless souls checked themselves out, heading for whatever shelf of eternity they had reserved. [505]
Yet the lens, revitalized, demanded a keeper; the octopus catalog wrapped a brass tentacle around his ankle, gently but firmly, offering tenure in exchange for perpetual calm. [532]
In that tethered moment he saw his own name appearing on the last blank page of “Perpetual Repose,” written in his careful mortuary hand—he had always believed he buried others, never himself. [563]
Accepting, he positioned himself at the circulation desk carved from a single block of coral, occupying impossible spaces between caretaker and cared-for. [588]
The undertaker became the lighthouse keeper of the drowned library, sending distress signals skyward not to summon rescue but to remind the living that rest has a permanent address, reachable if one is willing to descend. [632]
On stormy nights sailors report a column of chased stillness rising from the depths, a hush so complete it calms the waves; they know nothing of the weary man tending the glow, filing every returned soul under its proper star. [672]
And somewhere inland an empty parlor gathers dust, its bell silent, for the undertaker has finally given rest an address that never closes, a beacon that burns backward into the hearts of those still afraid of drowning in their own unfinished stories. [718]
