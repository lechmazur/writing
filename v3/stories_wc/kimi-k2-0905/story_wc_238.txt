The gossip-column exorcist arrived at the sheet music archive wearing yesterday’s headlines like a shroud: “CELEBRITY MEDIUM BANS BANSHEE FROM BEYONCE AFTER-PARTY.” [24]  
She had come during the hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down, when the air tasted of iron filings and unplayed sonatas. [37]  
Between the stacks, dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios, and the antique perfume bottle she carried pulsed—an imperfect miracle that still held one drop of 1892. [58]  
Its scent could resurrect any memory, but never the right one; that was the flaw the exorcist relied on. [75]  
She needed to reconnect with the sister she had exorcised by mistake ten years ago, a violin prodigy whose farewell note had been folded into a rest nobody observed. [96]  
The apology she carried felt heavier than any hex; it clung to her tongue like rosin, refusing vibrato. [111]  
She set the bottle on a scarred mahogany table, beside a stack of manuscripts labeled “Orchard Suite—Unperformed.” [126]  
Above, the fluorescent lights hummed in induced currents, the building’s old wiring singing a microtonal lament. [141]  
She touched the metal shelf; the current leapt into her wrist, guiding her hand to the exact folder where her sister’s last composition slept. [158]  
The title page read: “For S.—may you forgive the silence between us.” [170]  
The exorcist’s breath caught, forming a brittle chord. [178]  
She uncorked the perfume; the drop quivered, refusing to fall—an imperfect miracle waiting for consent. [194]  
Instead of releasing it, she spoke aloud, knowing the archive recorded every sound: “I thought banishing your ghost would stop the pain, but absence is just another dissonance.” [220]  
The drop trembled, reflecting her face fractured into thirty-two facets, each one a metaphor she had once advised clients with: “Grief is a violin without strings; you must bow the air until music believes you.” [252]  
Now she followed her own cryptic counsel, drawing the invisible bow across the silence. [268]  
The induced current answered, amplifying the faint harmonic of her sister’s name inside the fluorescent hum. [284]  
Manuscript pages rustled though no wind moved; the orchard outside held its breath, tractors idling at the property line like predators waiting for dawn. [303]  
She placed the perfume bottle on the stave of the first page, aligning its base with the clef; glass and ink vibrated at the same frequency, a fragile unison. [325]  
A shadow stepped out from between the shelves—her sister, edges flickering like a piano chord struck too hard, pedals still pressed. [344]  
The ghost’s eyes held no accusation, only the weary question musicians ask when the piece ends and applause hasn’t begun: Was any of it heard? [366]  
The exorcist chose her metaphor carefully: “We are two halves of a trill that never resolved; I clipped our tie, thinking silence was tidy.” [388]  
She lifted the bottle; the drop finally fell, landing on the shadow’s outstretched palm where it soaked in like ink into blotting paper. [408]  
The scent of lilac and thunder rolled through the archive, waking every dormant score; notes lifted off pages, swirling into a visible cyclone of staves and beams. [428]  
Together they read the swirling notation: a rest followed by a tie, a breath that refuses to end. [443]  
The sister’s form solidified just enough to speak in pizzicato whispers: “Play the rest; that’s where I live.” [459]  
The exorcist tore the apology from her throat—no longer a press release, just three naked words: “I was wrong.” [476]  
The orchard engines roared outside; chainsaws bit bark, the hush collapsing into brutal 4/4 time. [489]  
The ghost smiled, fading with the scent, leaving only the antique bottle—now empty of miracle but full of resonance. [506]  
The exorcist set the bottle inside the “Orchard Suite” folder, archiving her imperfect miracle alongside the music it had finally tuned. [525]  
She walked out past the tractors; the first tree fell, sounding a low E that rattled the perfume bottle against its paper cradle. [543]  
Headlines tomorrow would claim she’d bottled a soul, but she knew better: she had released one, and kept the echo. [562]  
Behind her, the archive lights dimmed; induced currents settled into a lullaby only the shelves would ever hear. [579]  
Somewhere in the felled orchard, a single lilac bloomed out of season—an imperfect miracle rooted in forgiven silence. [596]  
She bowed to the vibration, then left the gossip to write its own metaphors. [610]
