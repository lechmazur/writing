The carousel halted at 03:17, its brass poles exhaling steam into the kinetic lagoon that floated three kilometers above the dead ocean. [25]  
I stepped off the platform, a resolute scavenger clutching a cracked disposable camera wheel, the last uneroded gear that still remembered spin. [39]  
Cloudwater lapped at the copper deck, hissing where it touched the hot brass animals, and every hiss sounded like a syllable of my own name spoken backwards. [59]  
I am chronologically confused; yesterday I buried tomorrow’s body, and tomorrow I will be born from today’s ash, but tonight I need to speak with the ghost who wears my seventeen-year-old face. [87]  
The carousel’s stroboscopic lights fade into fractured stillness, leaving only the violet glow of the lagoon’s underside, where constellations are projected upside-down so fish can dream of flying. [113]  
I twist the disposable camera wheel; it clicks like a cracked vertebra, releasing a square of undeveloped night that smells of salt and burnt sugar. [137]  
Each click is a regret I collected by gathering fragments of overheard stories from passengers who rode the carousel before it stopped: a bride who lost her vowels, a pilot who forgot gravity, a child who traded his reflection for an extra turn. [177]  
Their voices are sand inside me, abrading the lens of ambition until the picture is only a white blur where a future should be. [205]  
Tonight those grains sing, guiding me along the lagoon’s floating walkway of mirrored tiles that reflect my gait in wrong order—left foot precedes right by three seconds, so I walk beside my own past. [241]  
At the lagoon’s center stands the only stationary horse, a black mare carved from obsidian, mane frozen mid-gallop; her eyes are empty cartridges. [270]  
I mount her not to ride but to anchor; the cloudwater rises, thickening into silver glass that records every motion without progress—perfect medium for a negotiation with what erodes. [305]  
I hold the camera wheel against the mare’s neck and speak the first story fragment: “I once wanted to map every island that appears only in the instant between lightning and thunder.” [348]  
The wheel absorbs the sentence, develops it into a 2x2 inch slide that projects onto the cloudscreen above us: a blurred green dot smeared by time. [378]  
My ghost steps out of that smear, seventeen, wearing the denim jacket I drowned in the same hour I realized cartography cannot fix a moving sky. [410]  
He looks at me with the chronological contempt only youth can aim at age, and I feel my ambitions erode another micron. [442]  
I click the wheel again, release the second fragment: “I wanted to be the last witness, the final memory before the world forgets itself.” [477]  
The slide shows an empty bench facing an empty horizon; my ghost sits on the real bench that now materializes at the lagoon’s edge, legs jittering to music that stopped years ago. [517]  
He speaks first, voice flickering like a filmstrip missing every fourth frame: “You replaced our future with a collection of other people’s endings.” [548]  
I answer by opening my coat, revealing the lining sewn from ticket stubs, each inked with someone else’s last wish; they rustle like startled birds. [580]  
The ghost reaches to touch them, but his hand passes through, and I feel the cold in my ribs—regret is just empathy traveling backwards. [608]  
I offer the camera wheel; he cannot take it, so I break it against the obsidian mane; twenty-four undeveloped squares spill out, flutter onto the silver water, each bearing a latent image of what we might have chosen. [653]  
Together, without agreement, we read the fragments aloud; the lagoon responds by freezing mid-ripple, suspending us in a fracture so still that even silence holds its breath. [692]  
In that fractured stillness I understand negotiation is not settlement but shared erosion: I accept his velocity, he accepts my decay; the images dissolve, seasoning the cloudwater with emulsified dreams. [730]  
When the carousel jerks back to life at 03:27, I step on alone; the ghost stays seated on the bench that is now dissolving into morning fog, waving with my own weary hand. [739]
