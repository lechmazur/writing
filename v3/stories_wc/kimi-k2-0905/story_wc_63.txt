The tide hissed against the tidal obsidian ridge, black glass hissing like hot iron in the dawn. [21]
I crouched inside the clock tower that straddled the ridge, fingertips on the brass pendulum, waiting for the pause in a pendulum's swing when gravity forgets its promise. [39]
For forty-seven years I have been the precise local clock tower winder, the last custodian of a mechanism that measures guilt as accurately as hours. [58]
Every dawn I halt the bob an inch from the left arc, feel the hush, and read the tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle I keep tucked in my coat. [83]
The handle once belonged to my brother who planted yams on the cliff until the village voted to let the sea take his field for the tower's foundation; the inscriptions are his apologies, one letter each full moon, incremental absolution etched with a fishhook. [120]
Today the letters end: “—e.” [126]
I breathe the searing reverie of salt and machine oil, knowing the sentence completes only if I add the final consonant, restoring shared balance between land, sea, and the ticking debt we inherited. [159]
The villagers say I am ethically diligent, but they watch from shuttered windows, afraid the tower will stop and spill their hoarded minutes into the tide. [190]
If the clock stops, contracts void, interest freezes, and the ridge itself may shrug, returning fields to my brother’s ghost. [213]
Yet if I keep the clock alive, the sea keeps eating, and the ridge narrows each year, obsidian teeth grinding bone. [240]
The pendulum hovers; I have the space of one heartbeat to choose. [252]
I draw the fishhook from my lapel, its tip worn thin by decades of incremental absolution, and carve the missing “r” into the rake handle, completing the word “forgive.” [295]
Wood dust drifts onto the escapement wheel, a harmless pollen. [310]
But absolution must be mutual; the tower demands a counterweight. [323]
I open the access panel and lash the broken rake handle to the pendulum rod, replacing the original bob, so that each swing now carries my brother’s apology through the gears and out over the village like a knell. [372]
The extra mass slows the beat; time slackens, waves seem to thicken, and villagers emerge onto the lanes rubbing their ears, feeling the cadence of their heartbeats match a farmer’s contrition. [413]
I wind the mainspring to compensate, arms burning, ethically diligent to the last. [434]
When the pendulum resumes, it sings a lower note, a vow rather than a verdict. [450]
Salt air corrodes certainty; the tower’s iron bones already blush with orange grief. [469]
I step outside as the sun clears the horizon, obsidian ridge glowing like a blade turned away from flesh. [491]
Below, my brother’s reclaimed field glints, wet furrows reflecting a sky that suddenly belongs to no creditor. [515]
The villagers do not thank me; they simply walk slower, carrying buckets of seed instead of ledgers. [537]
I return at dusk to find the tower door ajar, pendulum still swinging, rake handle bob describing steady incremental absolution above the tide. [571]
In the pause before night wind, I hear the letters clack softly against iron: for-give, for-give, a metronome teaching the sea to retreat one grain at a time. [610]
Someday the ridge will widen again, soil will emerge above black glass, and the clock will stop because no one needs to measure debt anymore. [646]
Until then I remain the precise local clock tower winder, oiling the pivot where wood meets metal, keeping shared balance in a world that finally breathes with the tide instead of against it. [695]
When my own time comes, they will lay me beneath the yam field, the broken rake handle above my heart, its tiny inscriptions complete, ticking out the searing reverie of forgiveness one swing at a time. [738]
