The defunct revolutionary, once called Aurelia Voss, pressed her palm against the baroque asteroid's obsidian wall and felt the slow pulse of visible time. [24]
Each throb showed her yesterday's fist raised beside today's trembling hand. [34]
She had come to the abandoned pleasure-palace to steal a single crystal vase shard rumored to predate the empire she had failed to topple. [52]
Archaeologists from two rival universities orbited overhead, broadcasting threats about forged provenance and cultural sacrilege, their dispute so loud it echoed through the vacuum as encrypted static. [75]
Aurelia cared nothing for their tenure tracks; she wanted the shard because its facets reflected futures that had never arrived. [95]
When she located the fragment glinting beneath a collapsed harpsichord, she lifted it like a dagger of light and saw, inside its glassy throat, the civilization she once promised to build. [120]
The vision staggered her: boulevards named after poets, courts where judges spoke only in questions, mirrors banned because they encouraged resignation. [143]
She whispered a stanza she had composed during her trial, words that had cost her twenty years in a lunar quarry: "We are the echo learning to shout back." [170]
The shard answered with a harmonic chime, confirming what she suspected—its silica lattice stored not just light but forgotten anthems. [193]
Outside, the visible storm of time approached, ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood. [211]
Aurelia knew the palace's mirrored halls would amplify the tempest, fracturing moments until past and future shredded each other. [230]
She devised a method older than the asteroid itself: covering every mirror with the velvet drapes that once framed opera boxes, denying the storm its multiplying gaze. [255]
Working with the patience of a poet stitching syllables, she moved from room to gilded room, pulling cloth across silvered glass while humming the measure of a revolutionary hymn. [285]
With each covered mirror, the air grew warmer, as though sorrow itself were being tucked into bed. [302]
She saved the largest glass for last: a ceiling fresco of mercury where cherubs rowed boats across a sky that had never been. [325]
Standing on a broken cello, she pinned the final drape, and the storm passed overhead without shattering a single second. [348]
In the hush that followed, Aurelia knelt, laid the crystal shard on a marble pedestal, and spoke to it as if it were the last citizen alive. [375]
"I failed you in the streets," she confessed, voice burnished by regret. [390]
"But here, where time is visible, I can reimagine you." [403]
She began to recite, each line a brick in an impossible city: libraries that open only at dusk, fountains flowing with unsent letters, courts where the accused judge themselves. [435]
The shard drank every word, its fractures glowing like constellations learning their names. [452]
Footsteps echoed—an archaeologist in a pressure suit stepped through the breach, plasma cutter humming. [470]
"Drop the artifact," he ordered, visor reflecting her aged face multiplied into a jury. [485]
Aurelia smiled with the serenity of a woman already acquitted by tomorrow. [497]
She lifted the shard, not to surrender it but to complete her final stanza. [510]
"Mirrorless, we become the reflection we sought," she said, and crushed the fragment against the pedestal. [528]
Light burst outward, not explosive but expansive, a quiet dawn filling every corridor. [543]
The archaeologist staggered as the light passed through him, his recorder suddenly full of poems instead of data. [560]
When the glow dimmed, the palace was unchanged, yet the air tasted of ink and rain. [575]
Aurelia was gone, her body dissolved into the burnished sorrow that lacquers all revolutions which arrive too early. [595]
But on the pedestal lay a new crystal, whole and humming, seeded by her verses. [610]
The archaeologist, no longer certain which side of history he occupied, covered the remaining mirrors before the next storm, repeating the method he had watched her devise. [640]
Above, the disputing ships quieted, their sensors detecting a civilization budding inside the asteroid, a place where time is visible and every citizen is poetically inclined. [670]
They argued still, but now their footnotes quoted anonymous lines about boulevards named after poets, fountains of unsent letters, courts where mirrors stay veiled. [700]
And somewhere in the lattices of the newborn crystal, Aurelia walked those boulevards, finally the citizen of a country that existed only because she had reimagined it into being. [730]
The revolutionary was defunct, the vase was whole, and the sorrow that burnished every surface was bright enough to read by. [750]
