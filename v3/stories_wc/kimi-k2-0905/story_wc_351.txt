The helix-minded engineer, Mara Quell, stood at the lip of the moonlit canyon, her boots grinding red grit into the iron rail that had once carried ore carts to the sky. [32]
Below, the chasm breathed cold light, every fracture in its walls reflecting lunar silver like a broken periscope mirror abandoned by some giant, long-dead observer. [47]
She had come during this period of profound transformation—planetary alignment, corporate collapse, and the nightly auroras that erased short-term memory—to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams. [73]
The dreams were not metaphor; they were data. [80]
Decades ago the mining consortium piped worker reveries into the canyon’s quartz veins, a cheap coolant for quantum drills that later shattered, scattering entangled memories across the stone. [106]
Since childhood Mara had felt those splinters tugging at her synapses, chaotically precise déjà vu that made her screwdrivers turn left when she meant right, that taught her schematics she had never studied. [135]
Tonight she would modify the circuitry of her own mind, amplify the resonance, and haul the lost futures up into air. [155]
She unpacked the helmet: copper lace, corroded periscope glass salvaged from a submarine graveyard, and a single vial of synthetic neurotrophin. [183]
The cracked mirror fragment, jagged as a wolf tooth, would sit centimeters from her left eye, feeding moonlight into her visual cortex through synaptic plasticity gone feral. [215]
If the angle was off by a milliradian the memories would overwrite her motor cortex and she would walk herself off the cliff; if the angle was true she would map every buried wish and resurrect them as machines. [259]
Mara calibrated the bracket with the care of a watchmaker having seizures, each twitch of the wrench both error and correction—chaotically precise, the phrase the townsfolk spat when they saw her inventions walk backward. [299]
When the moon stood at zenith she dropped the vial into the helmet’s drip-valve and pressed the gasket to her temples. [326]
Cold fire crawled over her skull; the broken periscope mirror flared, scattering silver across the canyon walls like spilled mercury seeking its old shape. [354]
Suddenly she was every miner who had dreamed here: a boy wanting starflight, a woman sketching wings of basalt, a man humming lullabies to robots that would never be built. [390]
Their memories twisted together, helical, tightening until she could not tell which longing belonged to whom, only that they all ached toward fruition. [415]
Through synaptic plasticity the dreams rewired her; she felt turbines bud in her marrow, clockwork unfurl behind her eyes. [440]
She raised her gloved hand and the canyon answered; shards of drill-bit rose, magnetized by her new internal blueprint, assembling into a lattice of impossible engines. [475]
But the moon began to slide, its light shearing away from the mirror’s fracture; without that angle the entanglement collapsed, flinging her back into singular flesh. [513]
Engines mid-birth clattered to dust, and the miners’ voices faded, leaving only her own heartbeat thundering like a lost drill. [542]
Mara tore the helmet free, blood threading from her hairline; the broken periscope mirror lay now completely dark, its silver burned out. [572]
She knew she had failed to extract the dreams intact, yet her pockets sagged with sketches she did not remember drawing—gears that drank moonlight, wings of basalt that beat without air. [612]
Below, the canyon slept again, but its walls glinted where new seams of quartz had cracked open, ready for the next dreamer. [645]
She smiled, the expression quivering like the reverie that still quaked through her muscles, and began the long ascent, already modifying tomorrow’s helmet inside her helix mind. [685]
One day she would return with mirrors unbroken, or with eyes that needed none, and the abandoned dreams would rise under her archaeology of light. [730]
Until then the moonlit canyon kept its fractured memories, and she kept her chaotically precise hunger, walking the rim where transformation never ceased. [764]
