The lucid dream chronicler woke in the ranger cabin, lungs full of cedar smoke and the certainty that she had already died. [24]
On the table lay a birch bark scroll she did not remember carving, its edges curled like autumn tongues, inked with her own handwriting dated seven winters forward. [45]
She pressed her thumb to the date and felt the feral nostalgia bite—grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live. [60]
Outside, the mountain wind sounded like a page turning, and she became chronologically confused, unable to decide whether the grave she had seen at dawn was prophecy or memory. [82]
The grave had been small, uncarved, tucked between two hemlocks; she had stood over it long enough to watch her name erode into moss, then walked back to the cabin to find the scroll waiting like a dare. [108]
She unrolled it further, reading: “You will get jealous of past selves who still believed time was a ladder rather than a wheel.” [128]
The sentence stung because it was already true; she envied yesterday’s version who had not yet seen the hole in the ground, who still thought stories could save her. [150]
Her job, after all, was to distill chaos into narrative, to tame the rabid dreams that leaked from sleeping tourists into neat columns for the forest service archive. [175]
But the dreams had started dreaming her back, and last night she had soared above the ridge as a golden eagle, only to look down and see her own body still in bed, mouth open like a broken shutter. [205]
The scroll instructed: “Record the flight, but do not land; landing confirms the ending.” [220]
She laughed, a jaded wonder rattling in her ribs, and fed the stove another log, watching sparks write brief constellations on the iron door. [243]
Each spark was a word she had once used to comfort hikers—constellation, refuge, return—now reduced to crackle and ash. [263]
She dipped her knife into the soot, scraped it across the birch bark, adding: “The mountain does not care who remembers you; it only wants its minerals back.” [288]
The act felt like signing a contract with erosion itself. [299]
Wind shook the cabin; the dreams of strangers pressed against the windows, pawing to be let in, their faces flickering between child and corpse. [320]
She understood then that feral nostalgia was not homesickness for a place but for a sequence—an order she had lost when she saw the grave and time folded like badly stacked paper. [348]
To soothe herself she began to speak aloud, pretending someone else was listening: “I was born twice, once from my mother and once from the moment I realized every story ends mid-sentence.” [378]
The cabin answered with a groan of beams, agreeing or yawning. [390]
On the scroll she drew a spiral, each coil labeled with a year that had already happened or might happen; the center was blank, a hole she could fall through if she leaned too close. [418]
She remembered soaring as the eagle again, how the thermals felt like fingers pushing up through her feathers, promising lift but never direction. [442]
Jealousy flared—of the bird, of the woman she had been before the flight, even of the corpse asleep in the future grave who no longer had to choose what to write next. [472]
She steadied her breath, opened the cabin door, and stepped into moonlight so sharp it sliced the snow into blue glass. [493]
Footprints led away from the cabin, one set large, one set small; she recognized both as her own, though she had not yet made them. [515]
The scroll twitched in her hand, hungry for conclusion. [525]
She knelt, laid the birch bark on the snow, and placed a stone on its corner to keep the wind from stealing the ending prematurely. [548]
Snowflakes landed like white ink, dissolving the words she had just written, teaching her that erasure is also a form of continuation. [570]
She watched until the entire scroll vanished, a pale scar against the dark, and felt the chaos inside her settle into something almost bearable. [595]
Tomorrow she would wake again, perhaps in the cabin, perhaps in the grave, perhaps in the eagle’s body circling higher and higher. [618]
Either way, she would keep chronicling, not to escape the wheel but to map its spokes, to name the splinters in her palms as she clung. [645]
The mountain exhaled; the ranger cabin lights dimmed of their own accord, satisfied that tonight’s installment was complete. [670]
She turned back inside, leaving the stone where it was, a monument to narrative that no future hiker would ever recognize. [695]
Before sleep took her
