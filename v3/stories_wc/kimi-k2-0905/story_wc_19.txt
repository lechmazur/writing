When gravity inverted for the hour, the bunker builder’s claustrophobic child, Lira, finally crawled out of the hatch she had feared since birth. [24]
She carried nothing but her mother’s tiny porcelain doll, its painted eyes chipped into perpetual surprise. [35]
Above the clouds, the xenial trellis—an ancient lattice of vine and brass—hung like a reversed cathedral, welcoming her onto its interlaced walkways. [55]
Each step she took felt intangibly tangible: the planks yielded like memory beneath her soles, then firmed into certainty the instant she trusted them. [77]
A gilded hush coated the air, thick as honey yet weightless, tasting of the silence that follows a last breath. [97]
Lira had come to collect the flavors of different silences, the way her father bottled oxygen against the day the bunkers failed. [119]
She believed that if she could name each quiet, she might stretch the contracted walls of her lungs until they forgot the shape of earth. [143]
The first silence she met sprouted between her teeth when she whispered the doll’s secret name—Mira—and heard nothing echo back. [167]
It tasted of iron doors sealing, of countdowns that never reached zero. [183]
By limiting exposure, she stepped only three planks forward, letting the hush settle on her skin like gold leaf that could be peeled away if panic rose. [210]
The second silence bloomed overhead as the inverted sky poured upward, revealing a garden of roots dangling like chandeliers. [233]
She reached, and the doll’s porcelain fingers brushed a root; instantly the quiet turned sweet, like the moment before a lullaby when breath is held to listen for the first note. [264]
Lira pocketed that flavor by pressing the doll’s lips to the root, transferring the hush into the glazed hollow of its throat. [290]
Gravity, still reversed, tugged her hair toward the earth she refused to look at, but the trellis warmed, xenial, guiding her higher. [315]
Halfway up, she met the keeper: an old pruner whose shears were blunt from trimming silences that grew like vines. [340]
He offered a trade—one of her memories for a cutting of gilded hush. [356]
Lira gave him the sound of the bunker's final bolt sliding home; he snipped a coil of quiet that sighed like her mother’s last exhalation. [385]
She tucked the coil inside the doll’s dress, felt the porcelain grow heavy with the weight of what was no longer heard. [408]
Time thinned; the hour was half gone. [418]
Higher still, the trellis narrowed to a single rail suspended in a column of absolute mute. [437]
Here the silence was not absence but presence, a membrane she had to break to breathe. [457]
Lira clutched the doll, whispered every name she knew for fear, and stepped through. [476]
The membrane clung, stretching her skin until the contracted chambers of her heart unfolded like paper cranes. [500]
On the far side, the final silence waited—flawless, self-contained, tasting of the moment before birth and after death. [525]
She understood then that to collect it would be to carry the bunker inside her forever. [547]
Instead, she opened the doll’s cracked skull and released the flavors she had stored: iron-sweet, lullaby, bolt-sigh. [573]
They spiraled away, painting the inverted sky with audible colors that only the claustrophobic could see. [597]
The trellis trembled, xenial no longer; the hour neared its end. [612]
Lira left the empty doll wedged between two vines, a porcelain chrysalis from which silence had emerged. [635]
As gravity slowly righted itself, she descended, lungs wide, tasting the ordinary hush of wind—thin, ungilded, hers. [659]
She would return to the bunker, but the walls, now intangibly tangible, could no longer contain her; she carried the stretched sky in every breath. [689]
When the hatch closed, she heard the faint click of porcelain settling above the clouds, a doll keeping watch over the flavors she had chosen to set free. [720]
