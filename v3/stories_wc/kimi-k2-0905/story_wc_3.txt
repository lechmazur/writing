The cuneiform translator, Mira, adjusted her spectacles as she stepped onto the magnetic arbor, the metal planks humming beneath her feet, suspended impossibly above a sea of clouds that glowed amber with the last light of a sun she could no longer see. [45]  
She had come after the spirit left, when the sky still echoed with the hollow after-ring of its departure, to reestablish what had been severed—not just the archive of voices etched in clay, but the gentle momentum of meaning itself. [60]  
Her satchel held one object: a knowledge fruit seed, black-purple and warm, pulsing like a slowed heart; it was said to sprout only when planted in soil that remembered every word ever spoken beneath it. [80]  
Mira’s kindly methodical nature, once praised by mentors in the lowland scriptorium, now felt like a lantern flickering against an avalanche, yet she unrolled her wax tablet, stylus ready, determined to map the physics of transition—how a presence becomes an absence without collapsing the world. [105]  
The arbor’s magnetic boughs swayed, iron leaves clicking in Morse-like patterns she almost recognized; she transcribed them as analogical thinking, letting each clang equal a wedge-shaped sign for “sky,” each silence the sign for “void,” until a sentence formed: “To leave is to linger in the shape of what moves on.” [130]  
She repeated it aloud, voice cracking, and the seed in her palm grew hotter, as though the sentence were its password. [145]  
Forty years ago, her mother had vanished into these same clouds while piloting an observation glider; the official report cited “haunted ambitions,” a phrase Mira had spent decades translating into every dialect of grief. [165]  
Now, standing on the swaying bridge between atmospheres, she understood the report had been literal: ambitions can be haunted, can follow you like scent, can demand you finish what they started. [185]  
She knelt, pressed the seed into a joint where two magnetic rails crossed, and covered it with iron filings that stuck like frost, forming a tiny metallic mound. [205]  
Nothing happened, so she began to hum the lullaby her mother sang while calibrating instruments—notes that measured wind shear the way lullabies measure fear. [225]  
The filings quivered, rearranged into cuneiform micro-glyphs spelling “return,” then “reside,” then “release.” [240]  
Mira’s eyes blurred; touching distance, she thought, is the span between fingertip and memory, close enough to feel warmth but never texture. [260]  
A sprout broke the mound, not green but silver, a filament of living mercury that climbed her wrist and drew bloodless runes on her skin, each one a phoneme she had translated from 3-millennium-old tablets: signs for “door,” for “breath,” for “balance.” [285]  
The arbor tilted; clouds parted below, revealing not earth but a mirror of the sky above, doubling the world into an hourglass shape with her at the neck. [305]  
She realized the physics of transition required symmetry: for every departure, an arrival somewhere else; for every spirit leaving, an idea returning. [325]  
Her mother’s voice came through the filament, kindly, methodical: “Measure the interval, Mira; record the echo; let the equation equal love divided by time.” [350]  
Mira laughed, because love over time is velocity, and velocity over distance is home. [365]  
She took her stylus, etched the equation into the magnetic leaf nearest her face, and the entire arbor resonated like a plucked string, clouds vibrating into concentric circles. [385]  
The silver plant flowered, a single bloom shaped like an open eye; its pupil was the seed, now transparent, inside which cuneiform letters floated like plankton. [405]  
She read them aloud, translating on the fly: “The departed become the grammar of the living; conjugate them carefully.” [425]  
At that, the spirit’s absence filled with presence—not her mother’s body but her mother’s pattern, a waveform Mira could walk through, each step sounding a syllable in the lullaby. [450]  
Together—translator and translated—they reestablished the archive: every tablet, every loss, every ambition now rooted in the magnetic arbor, feeding on iron and starlight. [470]  
The bloom folded, turned to obsidian glass, and dropped into the mirrored sky; where it fell, a new plank appeared, extending the bridge toward horizons that had not existed an hour ago. [495]  
Mira stepped onto the new plank, felt it firm beneath her weight, and understood the final translation: haunted ambitions are just love that hasn’t learned how to change shape.
