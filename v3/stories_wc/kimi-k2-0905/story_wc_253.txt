The blank-faced performer sat on the sagging farmhouse porch, whittling a stick whose shavings the wind turbines above snatched before they touched the ground. [27]
Since the happiness mandate had ended, the valley felt like a television left on after the station signed off, and she had come here to cultivate lightness in grief by dramatically narrating mundane tasks to the dried flower bouquet wired to the porch rail. [49]
"Observe," she intoned in the emotional void that passed for voice, "the blade kisses the grain at a seventeen-degree angle, releasing the scent of nothing important." [72]
Her moral ambiguity was a cloak she wore like weather; she had once reported neighbors for insufficient smiles, then later forged joy coupons so the condemned could buy one last minute of legal laughter. [101]
The turbines groaned overhead, three-armed giants choreographing a remade hush that made every heartbeat feel like vandalism. [121]
She shaved another curl, let the microphone hidden in her collar transmit the scrape to whatever sad bureaucrat still monitored the spectrum. [143]
Under the new silence ordinance, even this scratching might be classified as hopeful noise, so she labeled it "dirge" in the log book balanced on her knee. [166]
The dried flowers—strawflower, baby's breath, and one brittle rose—were the color of apologies no one had accepted; they quivered when the blades passed through their shadow, pretending to be alive. [197]
She lifted them, cradling the bouquet like an infant made of endings. [212]
"Item: hydration deprivation complete," she narrated. [222]
"Item: pigment surrender successful." [228]
"Item: memory retention optional." [234]
A lone crow landed on the fence, head cocked, judging whether blankness counted as a performance. [250]
She met its stare, thinking that if she could teach the bird to repeat her words, the valley might forgive itself for surviving the mandate. [272]
Instead, the crow spoke first: "Whittle me a space where guilt fits like a splinter, and I will carry it until the wind erodes us both." [295]
She answered by shaving the stick into a feather shape, hollowed shaft and tapered vane, then offered it. [314]
The crow took the wooden feather in its beak, flew upward, and lodged it in the joint of the nearest turbine, a small rebellion against the remade hush. [338]
The performer resumed her seat, opened the next stick, and began again. [350]
"Action: repetition as sedative," she said, louder, so the ghosts of the fined and the jailed could hear. [368]
Inside the farmhouse, the former laughter compliance officer—now her reluctant host—listened through cracked plaster, unsure whether to arrest her or thank her for making the silence bearable. [398]
He stepped onto the porch, uniform shirt unbuttoned, badge scratched blank. [413]
"You still believe lightness can grow in this?" he asked, gesturing at the turbines, the withered fields, the sky scrubbed of clouds by enforced cheer. [442]
She did not pause the blade. [447]
"Grief is soil," she replied, "and hush is the shovel; what we plant is voluntary, what grows is not." [466]
He sat beside her, produced his own knife, and started whittling a second stick, shavings joining hers in the turbine updraft. [488]
Together they carved without pattern, letting the wood decide what it would become. [503]
The crow returned, carrying in its beak a real feather, electric white against the gray. [521]
It dropped the gift into the dried bouquet, and for a moment the dead flowers looked like they might vote on resurrection. [540]
The performer laid down her knife, lifted the bouquet, and held it into the wind stream coming off the blades. [558]
Petal fragments tore away, flashing like old confetti, until only the bare stems remained, a skeleton honest enough to carry future blossoms. [582]
She planted those stems in the ground at the foot of the porch, anchoring them with the wooden feather and the nameless object the officer’s knife had revealed. [608]
Then, still blank of face but lighter in the shoulders, she began to narrate the watering of nothing with an empty can, describing every absent drop until the sky, confused, let fall a single real tear. [642]
It struck the planted stems, hissed, and vanished, but the soil darkened as if remembering rain. [659]
The turbines kept turning, yet their whoosh now sounded like a distant audience exhaling after a long held note. [678]
The officer pocketed his badge, tossed the last sliver of wood into the air, and watched the crow chase it into the gray. [695]
The performer closed her log, wrote one final line: "Remade hush acknowledged; performance suspended; lightness possible, though not guaranteed." [720]
She left the whittled sticks scattered like runes, took the empty bouquet wrapper, and tied it to the turbine fence where it flapped like a flag for the morally ambiguous, announcing to the valley that grief, having been cultivated, might now be allowed to weigh something, and in that weight, perhaps, a new kind of song.
