The reluctant caretaker of the cursed orchard, Mara, stood at the cliff’s edge, her boots crunching on frost-brittle grass as she studied the labyrinth below. [28]
Wind hissed through the cliffside labyrinth patrolled by mechanical birds, their brass wings clicking like metronomes against the dusk. [41]
She had until the night frost formed—less than an hour—to guide the lost travelers out, or their bones would join the others tangled in the briars. [62]
Mara clenched a small nut in her pocket, the last gift her mother had pressed into her palm before the curse took her voice. [84]
The nut was no snack; it was the seed of the single tree that grew outside the curse’s logic, and its shell bore the forgotten blueprint etched in microscopic ridges. [111]
Offhandedly exact, Mara recited the maze’s shifting map aloud, though no one heard; the words were for the wind to carry to those still breathing inside. [139]
She could not enter the labyrinth—any footstep on its stones would rouse the mechanical birds to spew razor feathers—but she could leave impressions without touching. [171]
Mara knelt, pressed her gloved palm to the ground, and let the chill seep through until the soil remembered her weight. [197]
When she lifted her hand, a faint depression remained, a ghost of warmth shaped like an arrow pointing toward the first safe turn. [223]
She moved along the rim, repeating the gesture, assembling a trail of warmth-ghosts that only desperate eyes would notice. [251]
Below, a flicker of lantern light stuttered between walls; the travelers had reached the third junction, where the path split into seven lies. [279]
Mara cracked the small nut between molars, tasting iron and pine, and rolled the kernel under her tongue like a secret coin. [304]
The forgotten blueprint flared across her vision: a spiral within a spiral, the exit hidden where the cliff shadow kissed the first frost line. [334]
She hated the orchard—every gnarled trunk bled sap that formed faces at dusk, mouths open in silent accusation—but guiding the lost was the only graceless beauty allowed her. [378]
A mechanical bird swooped, lens-eye whirring; Mara froze, breath held, letting the wind erase her scent. [401]
It hovered, gears singing a lullaby of grinding teeth, then banked away, satisfied that no living trespasser stood on forbidden stone. [429]
Time thinned; frost began to lace the grass blades like tiny white nooses. [447]
Mara reached the final vantage point and saw the travelers: three silhouettes, one limping, one carrying the smallest on her back. [473]
They hesitated at the last fork where the blueprint promised safety, but the leftward path glittered with deceptive moonlight. [502]
She could not shout; the curse swallowed sound. [515]
Instead, she spat the nut-kernel onto her glove, crushed it, and smeared the oily mash across her palm. [538]
The impression she left this time was not an arrow but a handprint, five warm dots that glowed faintly, a constellation against the cold ground. [569]
She pressed her wrist to the earth and held, counting heartbeats, until the warmth bled down the cliff face like a candle left too close to the edge. [603]
The limping traveler looked up, eyes catching the faint glow, and turned right, toward the hidden stair carved by smugglers two centuries dead. [635]
Mara rose, knees popping, and watched them descend the cliffside path she could never walk herself. [657]
Behind her, the cursed orchard stirred, branches creaking a lullaby of rot and remembrance. [675]
She did not turn; she had no love for the trees, only duty. [690]
When the last traveler's heel vanished onto safe scree, the night frost formed, sealing her warm handprints into crystal fossils. [716]
The mechanical birds settled onto the labyrinth walls, wings folding like prayers nobody taught them. [735]
Mara pocketed the empty shell halves, their ridges still sharp enough to cut regret, and started the long walk back to the orchard that kept her prisoner. [764]
Tomorrow there would be new travelers, new frost, and the same graceless beauty of saving strangers she would never meet again. [800]
