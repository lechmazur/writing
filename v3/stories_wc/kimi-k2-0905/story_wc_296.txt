The druid named Briar stood at the edge of the swirling orchard vortex, her fingers curled around the flesh-eating plant seed like it was a prayer bead and not a death sentence. [34]
She had come to the cursed lake after the magic trick failed, the one meant to freeze her confession inside a mirror so she could finally see what mirrors don't show. [48]
Instead, the glass had shattered and sliced the conjurer's throat, and the blood had steamed on the ice like a war banner planted too early. [68]
Briar was guarded by nature, not choice; every soul she'd ever tried to trust had twisted into brambles under her touch, so she spoke only to things that could not answer. [98]
Yet the lake answered, its vortex of leafless apple trees rotating slowly, trunks creaking like old siege towers remembering the push of war. [128]
She stepped onto the first floating root, feeling it bob under her weight, and began the method of expanding circles the way her mentor had once taught: start narrow, let each loop carry you farther than the last, until the center can no longer pull you back. [173]
The druid’s gift was to find lost things, but the cost was that they clung: a child’s shoe still warm, a soldier’s tongue still trying to form the name of the woman he betrayed, a confession wrapped in frost and hidden from every polished surface. [229]
Today she hunted the reflection that had escaped her, the sentence she could not speak aloud: I loved the enemy and let the village burn so the trees would keep singing only to me. [295]
Each circle of roots she crossed widened the gyre; apples frozen mid-rot bobbed like skulls, their black skin splitting to reveal seeds that looked identical to the one she carried. [345]
She pressed the flesh-eating seed against her wrist until its tiny jaws awakened and tasted her; pain bloomed, but the plant would remember her blood and spare her later when it fed on everything else. [410]
At the seventh circle, the vortex stilled for the space of a heartbeat, and the water beneath the trees turned to polished silver, a mirror lying sideways. [455]
In it she saw no face, only smoke that curled into the shape of the orchard before fire, and she understood the trick had not failed—it had refused her cowardice. [510]
The confession had to be spoken, not frozen, and it had to be spoken here where the lake could drink it and the roots could record it in their slow rings. [560]
Briar unbent her knees first, then her spine, then the locked fence of her ribs, until she knelt on the root like a penitent soldier laying down arms that still wanted to kill. [620]
"I let them die so the green would stay mine," she said, the words scraping out like blades withdrawn from wet stone. [670]
The seed in her wrist pulsed, recognizing truth as nourishment; it sprouted in seconds, vines wrapping her arm but stopping at the elbow, holding her like a comrade. [730]
Around her, the mirrored water accepted the confession, and the spinning orchard slowed into a perfect stillness that felt like the hush after a battle when both sides discover they are the same flesh. [800]
She remained there, half-bound by the plant that chose not to devour, guardian and trespasser both, finally seen by something that did not reflect her face but her unhidden war. [860]
When the vortex began to turn again, it moved counterclockwise, rewinding the gyre, carrying her outward on expanding circles that no longer felt like escape but like returning something lost to a world that would now decide what to do with her. [940]
Behind her, the lake sealed its silver eye, and the orchard kept its new secret in the slow language of sap and scar, a confession neither frozen nor forgotten but growing, ring by ring, into the timber of tomorrow’s storms. [1020]
