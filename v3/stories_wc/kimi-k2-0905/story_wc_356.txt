The turning of the tide's thought arrived when the wind reversed above the clouds, and the treetop village of Larkspur swayed like a single breathing organism. [32]
In that hush, where wildflower scent drifted upward on warm updrafts, ambitious herbalist Myrrh Vela crouched on a rope bridge, pressing a corpse flower seed against her cheek to test its readiness. [50]
She was olfactorily sensitive; one wrong note of rot could spoil years of patient grafting, so she waited until the seed exhaled the faintest breath of carrion promise. [70]
Below, the tide itself reversed in the estuary, salt water sliding inland, carrying rumors of the world Myrrh had left behind for these secret canopies. [90]
She journalized the moment in the tiny notebook she kept inside her sleeve, ink made from moon-mulled violets: “Seed breathes; tide thinks; I must move without disturbing either.” [113]
The undercurrent of wisdom here was that motion could be stillness if timed to the forest’s own pulse, a lesson her mother had tried to teach through family custom: when gifts were exchanged, you doodled the recipient’s secret nature on the interior of the wrapping paper, visible only when the package was undone. [158]
Myrrh’s mother had drawn spirals of smoke around a leaping hare—serenity within motion—on the paper that held Myrrh’s first pruning knife, and the memory smelled of almond gum and paperbark. [190]
Tonight Myrrh carried no knife; only the seed, a spool of spider-silk, and a folded square of indigo paper already patterned inside with her own doodle: a single bloom exhaling tiny birds. [220]
She needed a graft-site where motion was constant yet calm, so she climbed toward the village heart, planks narrowing until the bridge became a limb, then a twig, then mere suggestion. [250]
Villagers believed the highest boughs were haunted by wind-spirits who traded wisdom for fragrance; Myrrh believed they were simply olfactorily sensitive like herself, and thus choosy. [285]
She greeted them the way her mother taught: exhale slowly, let your scent speak honesty, then wait. [305]
The hush answered, wildflower sweet, and the path opened into a platform grown around a living trunk, its bark scarred by generations of ceremonial grafts. [330]
Here the tide’s thought was loudest, a hush inside roar, sap rising with the moon-dragged sea. [350]
Myrrh knelt, spread the indigo paper, and folded the corpse flower seed inside, aligning its dark veins with the doodled bloom so the birds appeared to carry it upward. [380]
She whispered the family custom: “What is hidden feeds what is revealed,” then pierced bark and seed alike with the silk needle, stitching seed to cambium in a figure-eight knot that allowed sway without tear. [420]
Serenity within motion: the seed must rot just enough to fuse, yet not so much that its stench alerted night-flying pollinators who would devour it. [450]
She journalized again, breathing through her mouth to mute the olfactory storm: “Stitch holds; seed sighs; village sways; I sway inside the sway.” [480]
The undercurrent of wisdom rose as scent: first iron, then bruised banana, then the unmistakable perfume of forthcoming bloom, a promise ten years early. [510]
Myrrh felt ambition loosen into gratitude; she had meant to astonish the village, but instead the village had astonished her by holding still while she moved. [540]
She sealed the notebook, tucked the pen behind her ear, and began the descent, each footfall a syllable in a sentence spoken by the tree. [570]
Halfway down, she met her mother climbing up, carrying a fresh square of paper; they passed without words, exchanging only breath, and Myrrh caught the almond-gum scent of her childhood. [610]
Later, when the corpse flower opened at moonrise, its odor of sweet death drifted through the platforms like lullaby, and villagers dreamed of flying hares exhaling birds. [650]
Myrrh woke before dawn, opened her journal, and drew on the inside of the last page: a spiral of smoke around a seed that had become a quiet heart. [680]
She wrapped the notebook in indigo paper, tied it with spider-silk, and left it on the highest bridge for the wind-spirits, whoever they were. [710]
Then she descended toward the reversing tide, serenity no longer a goal but a companion walking inside her footsteps, wildflower hush following like a scent she would never again need to chase. [750]
