The candid toll keeper named Mara stood alone in her glass-walled booth at the foot of the lightning collection tower, listening to the hush that still clung to the city after the blackout. [34]
She had worked the dusk shift for eleven years, collecting coins and watching the sky bruise into nectar dusk, that slow pour of amber light that made even rust look sweet. [50]
Tonight the tower’s copper rods above her hummed with residual static, but the drone beehive nested inside the upper lattice had gone silent; the colony had collapsed when the power died, and the city’s engineers had sealed the hatch, declaring the experiment a failure. [79]
Mara’s job was to take two credits from every visitor who wanted to climb the tower and taste the bottled lightning sold in the gift shop, yet with the elevators dark she had no visitors, only the smell of ozone and the soft ticking of cooling metal. [104]
Routine, she believed, was a fragile varnish over wonder; if she let the night feel ordinary, the small magic of her post would flake away, so she recalibrated the manual turnstile just to hear its brass heart beat. [129]
A boy appeared at the rail, carrying a lacquer box the color of burnt honey; he wore the ash-smudged uniform of the drone apiary techs, and his eyes were wide with the involuntarily truthful stare of someone who has seen systems fall. [156]
He offered no coin, only the box, saying, “The queen left this for the keeper of the threshold,” and because Mara’s tongue was likewise cursed by the tower’s ionized air to speak only truth, she answered, “I keep nothing but the gate; take your riddle elsewhere.” [198]
But the boy set the lacquer box on her ledger shelf, flipped the tiny brass latch, and inside lay a single matchbox painted with a spiral of bees; he struck a match, cupped the flame, and the sudden light revealed a sliver of paper curled like a proboscis. [243]
Mara read the cryptic riddle aloud, unable to stop herself: “When nectar dusk hardens to night, seek the spark that never burned; open the sky where drones once yearned.” [283]
The match hissed out, and the boy vanished into the gloom, leaving only the matchbox and the taste of sulfur on her truthful tongue. [309]
She understood the tower collected lightning, but the riddle hinted at a second harvest—wonder itself—and her motivation to preserve wonder in routine flared like the struck match. [341]
Mara pocketed the matchbox, locked her booth, and began the forbidden ascent up the maintenance stairs that corkscrewed inside the lightning collection tower, each step echoing like a dropped coin. [376]
Halfway up, she passed the sealed drone beehive chamber; through a cracked viewport she saw the lifeless hexagonal frames, their wax wings melted into golden puddles that reflected her face in nectar dusk hues. [414]
The sight should have discouraged her, but instead it sharpened her purpose: if the engineered bees could no longer bridge sky and hive, perhaps human curiosity could. [452]
At the summit platform, copper cones bristled like petrified sunflowers; normally, automated arms would lower them to bottles, but tonight they stood open to the cooling air, hungry for voltage that had nowhere to go. [495]
Mara opened the lacquer box again, removed the matchbox, and found inside a second riddle etched on the inner flap: “Truth draws the bolt; speak the lie you never told.” [536]
Involuntarily truthful her whole life, she had never lied, yet the riddle demanded a falsehood to complete the circuit; so she pressed her palms to the copper and whispered into the nectar dusk, “There is no wonder left.” [576]
The sky answered with a delayed summer bolt, a jagged afterthought of the blackout, striking the tallest rod and cascading blue fire down the cones into the dead hive below, reanimating the wax into glittering threads that hummed like tiny wings. [622]
Mara felt her hair lift, her booth keys levitate, and every coin in her apron leap out to orbit her like copper bees before clattering back, newly etched with the silhouette of a bee. [658]
The lacquer box snapped shut of its own accord, the matchbox inside now warm as fresh bread; she descended past her booth, left the gate open, and placed the box on the turnstile arm like an offering. [693]
Dawn would bring engineers who would reboot elevators and declare the hive a loss, but dusk would return, and with it travelers seeking bottled lightning; they would find the gate unlatched, the toll waived, and in the ticket slot a single matchbox containing a cryptic riddle that promised: wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest.
