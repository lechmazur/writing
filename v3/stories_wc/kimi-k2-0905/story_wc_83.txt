The geode crystal pulsed against my shattered ribs like a second heart, its jagged edges catching starlight through the observatory's transparent floor. [31]  
I had survived the drone strike that vaporized my wedding by diving into the crater it carved, clutching this stone I'd meant to gift my bride—now the only tangible remnant of a life that had been intangibly real moments before. [58]  
The floating observatory drifted three miles above the desert where the attack occurred, its helium sacs hissing as circuit breakers cooled from the electromagnetic pulse that had knocked it offline during the strike. [88]  
I wasn't supposed to be here; survivors were corralled into refugee camps, but the geode's hum had pulled me upward through maintenance shafts while guards dealt with system failures. [118]  
My hands shook as I pressed the crystal against the observatory's quantum telescope, watching its internal fractures rearrange into maps—veins of unused potential pooling in places the bombs hadn't touched. [150]  
The awakening came unfiltered: each facet showed futures that died with my wedding guests, possibilities collapsing into the void between what was and what could never be. [180]  
Through perturbation theory, I'd learned to hunt these pools of potential by calculating how small actions ripple through devastated systems—how stepping left instead of right at the crater's edge could save a life three thousand miles away. [218]  
The geode grew warmer, its intangible memories becoming tangible weight as I tracked energy signatures across the desert below, following trails of choices that never got made. [250]  
I found my first pool in a bombed-out schoolhouse where children's arithmetic workbooks still held equations whose solutions could redirect missiles—potential trapped in unfinished math. [282]  
The hunt required becoming perturbation myself: I smashed another circuit breaker, sending the observatory listing starboard, its shift creating wind patterns that would carry a farmer's prayer flags into a drone's flight path tomorrow. [320]  
Each action cost pieces of the geode; fragments crumbled into stardust that tasted like my wedding cake, leaving me lighter even as the crystal grew heavier with accumulated might-have-beens. [353]  
The bleak exhilaration hit when I realized I wasn't saving anyone—just harvesting their unlived lives to fuel this mechanical grief, turning tragedy into a resource more precious than water in the refugee camps. [385]  
My bride's face appeared in the telescope's reflection, her smile fracturing across the geode's surface like light through cracked glass, asking why I'd chosen to become death's accountant instead of its victim. [418]  
The answer lay in the observatory's cooling systems: even machines need pause between catastrophes, circuit breakers requiring time to reset before channeling more destruction. [450]  
I hunted faster now, collecting potential from a hospital's unadministered vaccines, from a musician's unplayed requiem, from lovers who'd never meet because their coffee shop became rubble. [485]  
The geode's final fragment showed my own unused potential: the life where I'd died with her, our atoms mingling in the blast wave instead of me standing here, a grave robber of possibility. [518]  
When the last piece crumbled, I understood the hunt's true purpose—not to find where potential pools, but to realize it had never left; every unlived moment hovered around me like radiation. [550]  
I stepped onto the observatory's outer railing as circuit breakers clicked back online, feeling the intangibly tangible weight of all those futures pressing against my skin like desert wind. [582]  
The perturbation I'd become rippled outward: my fall would alter the telescope's alignment by .003 degrees, redirecting tomorrow's drone strike from a village to an empty wadi. [615]  
As I dove, the geode's dust swirled into patterns resembling wedding guests raising champagne flutes, their toasts silent in the thin air while below, unused potential began its slow, inevitable pooling. [655]  
The desert rushed up to meet me like a bride's embrace, and in that final moment before impact, I finally felt the bleak exhilaration of becoming someone else's unfiltered awakening. [695]
