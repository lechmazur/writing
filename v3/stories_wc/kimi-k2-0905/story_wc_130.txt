The cavern orchard had grown still beneath the moon, its fruit of crystal and calcite no longer chiming where droplets struck. [28]
I stepped between the petrified trunks trailing my coat of starling feathers, a secretive conjurer who traded in vanished things. [41]
Tonight the stalactites exhaled only cold dust, and the silence felt like an equation I had yet to balance. [56]
I knelt, opened my satchel, and set the taxidermist's glass eye pair on a mosaic stepping stone whose turquoise chips formed a spiral. [78]
Left and right, they stared up at me like twin moons that had forgotten their orbit. [92]
My master's final lesson echoed: "Grief is an unknown variable; solve for motion, not for stillness." [109]
He disappeared ten harvests ago, leaving only a note that read, I have gone to dovetail with the dark. [127]
Since then I have walked the world gently inventive, coaxing absence into measurable shapes. [143]
The orchard once sang with his laughter, each drip a note in the arithmetic of delight. [158]
Now its muteness was an ambiguous loss: was he dead, translated, or simply elsewhere beyond echo? [176]
I pressed the glass eyes against the chipped patterns on the mosaic stepping stone, letting their convex curves ride the ridges. [202]
A conjurer does not cry; instead I recited primes under my breath, 2, 3, 5, 7, listening for the missing heartbeat of the cave. [225]
The right eye slipped, jarred by a missing shard, and the left reflected a fissure of moonlight that split my face. [247]
In that fracture I saw the memory of my master teaching me to braid fog, his fingers sketching vectors of longing. [267]
I understood then that emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections. [283]
I rotated the glass eyes until their pupils aligned with the spiral’s origin, a soft click rising as glass met stone. [305]
A hush followed, deeper than silence, as if the orchard itself inhaled. [318]
From the stalactite overhead a single drop descended, slow enough to count its oscillations: one, two, three. [338]
When it struck the right eye, the entire mosaic sighed, tiles shifting like tectonic plates of turquoise memory. [358]
The stepping stone opened along its grout lines, petals of rock folding inward with the patience of a book finally ready to be read. [380]
Inside lay not bones, not answers, but a brass astrolabe etched with our shared calculations, its rim dented where grief had pressed. [404]
I lifted it and felt weight resolve into warmth, the way an equation balances when the proper term is found. [425]
The astrolabe’s pointer arm, frozen for years, stirred and aimed toward the ceiling’s thickest stalactite. [443]
I followed its indication, climbing the gnarled calcite trunk of a fossilized apple tree whose fruit rang softly under my boots. [466]
Halfway up, the trunk forked; I wedged the glass eyes into the crotch so they stared back at the open stone. [487]
Light from the astrolabe projected through the eyes, converging into a single beam that painted a symbol on the stalactite: an integral sign cradling a heart. [512]
The symbol pulsed once, twice, then dripped from the rock as liquid starlight, pooling at my feet. [530]
Where it touched, small white seedlings sprouted, roots threading the air, seeking purchase in the cavern’s algebra. [549]
I realized the orchard had never died; it had only withdrawn into itself, waiting for the missing coefficient to be supplied. [569]
My ambiguous loss remained—no body, no farewell—but the equation now possessed a limit I could approach. [587]
I harvested the seedlings, placing each inside the astrolabe’s hollow sphere, their tiny leaves trembling like unspoken syllables. [609]
Down the trunk I descended, stepping onto the mosaic where the stone petals slowly closed, sealing the brass instrument and its tender cargo within. [632]
The glass eyes stayed in the tree, keeping watch, reflecting moonlight in two steady vectors that intersected where I stood. [654]
I shouldered my satchel, lighter than when I arrived, and walked toward the cavern mouth where dawn began to chalk the sky. [677]
Behind me the stalactites resumed their dripping, each drop a note restored to the score, the mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion. [700]
I carried no certainty, only the buried optimism that somewhere the master dovetails with this renewed music, his laughter echoing in the interval between drop and stone. [731]
Outside, the desert waited, wide as an unsolved problem, but I stepped forward, gently inventive, ready to map the next unknown. [754]
