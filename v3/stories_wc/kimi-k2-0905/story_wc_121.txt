The gravity defier known only as Kael stood at the edge of the glowing viaduct, watching rainwater bead and fall upward into the night sky. [29]  
Between the drop and the ripple—those two heartbeats when physics forgets its own laws—Kael stepped forward, boots leaving no prints on the wet stone. [48]  
The ancient clay tablet pressed against his ribs beneath the coat, its runes pulsing like dying stars, each pulse another fracture in the timeline he carried. [71]  
He had stolen it from the Archive of Unfinished Hours, a place that existed only at 3:19 A.M. in cities that never learned their own names. [98]  
The tablet was periodically eternal: every seventh minute it forgot its age and became newborn, every thirteenth it remembered every future it would ever doom. [125]  
Kael’s motivation was simple, impossible: to conquer the labyrinth of self, the maze of versions he had become across the splintered centuries. [149]  
Tonight the viaduct glowed cobalt, algae bred by neon rain lighting the arches like cathedral bones, and the air tasted of copper pennies and ozone. [176]  
He retraced his steps not by memory—memory was a traitor here—but by procedural generation: letting the tablet’s runes compute the probability cloud of his previous passages. [207]  
Each footfall spawned a ghost-Kael who walked slightly left or right of truth, and he had to choose which echo to follow before they all walked off the edge of now. [235]  
The first fracture opened silently: a hairline crack hanging vertically in the air, revealing another Kael running backward, mouth open in a scream that sucked light inward. [263]  
Darkening brightness spread from the crack; the viaduct’s glow dimmed while the sky above it blazed white, as if someone had inverted the dial of night. [290]  
Kael pressed his palm to the tablet; the runes rearranged themselves into the shape of his childhood bedroom, wallpaper peeling like sunburned skin. [315]  
In that remembered room he had once hidden from a father who collected broken clocks, a man convinced that if enough timepieces died, one might stay alive forever. [344]  
The procedural algorithm hiccupped, spitting out a path that led through the fracture instead of around it, and Kael understood the labyrinth had grown teeth. [370]  
He stepped through. [372]  
On the other side, rain fell sideways, each droplet a frozen second that sliced his coat and left temporal papercuts across his forearms. [395]  
The gravity defier twisted, letting the wounds leak hours instead of blood; he watched yesterday puddle at his feet and soak into the stonework. [418]  
Ahead, the viaduct forked into seventeen identical arches, each inscribed with a different name for the same sin. [438]  
He walked the center path because the tablet’s runes spelled “you” in a language that had never had a second person before. [460]  
With every stride the arches shortened, compressing distance the way old gods compress worship into fear. [480]  
At the far end stood the final iteration: Kael aged ten thousand days, skin translucent as wet paper, eyes two black moons absorbing light without reflection. [508]  
The elder Kael held another tablet, its runes already exhausted, edges crumbling like dried riverbed. [525]  
“To conquer the labyrinth,” the elder whispered, voice the sound of pages turned by wind in an empty library, “you must erase the minotaur at its heart.” [552]  
Younger Kael understood: the monster was the sequence of choices that led him here, a beast stitched from every moment he refused to become someone else. [578]  
Between the drop and the ripple—the same two heartbeats—he lifted the ancient clay tablet high and smashed it against the viaduct’s glowing rail. [602]  
The runes scattered, each symbol a bird of fired clay seeking its own birthplace in the fractures. [620]  
Timelines collapsed inward, not with thunder but with the soft sigh of a book closing after the last reader has died. [638]  
The elder Kael dissolved first, then the arches, then the rain, until only the original moment remained: a single drop hanging motionless above dark water. [660]  
Kael stepped off the viaduct into nothing, no longer defying gravity but negotiating with it, offering his weight in exchange for a name he had not yet spoken. [687]  
The drop touched the surface; the ripple spread. [692]  
In its expanding ring he saw not his reflection but an open doorway, and through it a room where a boy waited, clocks ticking backward on every wall. [715]  
Kael walked forward, coat drying in a wind that had not started blowing, the labyrinth folding behind him like a paper map finally recognizing the world is round. [743]  
When the glow faded, the viaduct stood ordinary, rainwater falling the way rain is supposed to fall, and no sign remained of the periodically eternal except the echo of footsteps deciding which self to leave behind. [771]
