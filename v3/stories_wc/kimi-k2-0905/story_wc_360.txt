The letterpress operator known only as Quince worked by starlight in the topaz workshop built into the cliff, its translucent dome admitting the sky while the rest of the valley slept. [33]
Between vanishing stars he set each letter backwards, inked in moon-silver, chasing the mathematics of emotion with leaden fractions of sense. [45]
Tonight the cryptic operator felt the press itself breathing, its flywheel a slow heart, because yesterday he had borrowed the personality of the widow who sold him paper and her grief still clung to him like wet newsprint. [67]
He laid a halo fragment—a curve of glass once part of an angelic circlet—onto the blank broadsheet, believing the shard could transpose empathy the way a prism transposes light. [89]
When the platen descended, the halo did not crack; instead it sank into the fibers, leaving only a glowing outline that pulsed like a question. [108]
Quince lifted the sheet and read a sentence he had not set: “To feel another is to forget the weight of zero.” [129]
The words disoriented him; his own memories tilted, sliding toward the gutter of the page. [144]
He braced against the press, but the machine returned only deliberate ambiguity, its gears clicking out half-truths in Morse he almost knew. [167]
Outside, the topaz dome shimmered as another star vanished, its light subtracted from the equation overhead. [186]
Quince habitually borrows personalities the way printers borrow type, and tonight he needed the mind of the astronomer who first noticed the disappearances, so he opened the shop’s cedar drawer where kept names rolled like negatives. [218]
He found the astronomer’s strip, fed it into the ink-duct, and let the press ghost the man’s careful calculus across his own tongue. [244]
Numbers flooded him—eigenvalues of sorrow, vectors of longing—yet the halo fragment glowed brighter, insisting on heart rather than proof. [267]
Under the intensifying shine Quince saw the workshop double: one room orderly, one room drowned in spectral tears. [287]
The disorientation peaked when he realized both visions were true; the astronomer’s logic and the widow’s grief superposed, waveforms intersecting in his chest. [312]
He stumbled onto the balcony, lungs full of lucid turbulence, and addressed the ragged sky: “If feeling equals forgetting the self, what remains to do the arithmetic?” [348]
The halo fragment answered from the paper still in his hand, its glow rising off the page into the shape of a child made of light. [374]
The child spoke with the voice of every personality Quince had ever borrowed, chords layered like over-inked type: “We are the remainder you never accounted for.” [404]
Quince understood then that transposed empathy was not transmission but subtraction; each borrowed life eroded the lattice of his own until only the common denominator of longing survived. [441]
He lifted the glowing child, felt its weightlessness, and knew the vanishing stars were not extinguished but gathered here, condensed into this single radiant variable. [472]
To reclaim them he must reverse the press, print himself back into the world, yet doing so would scatter every borrowed soul he carried, returning them to owners who no longer existed. [512]
The cryptic operator hesitated, tasting the astronomer’s hunger for pattern and the widow’s hunger for presence, both equally absolute. [542]
Between vanishing stars he made his choice: he placed the child of light onto the platen, closed the press, and turned the flywheel backward. [572]
Ink flowed uphill, letters lifted from paper, and personalities peeled away like loosened plates, each exhalation a star rekindled overhead. [603]
When the last glyph detached, the halo fragment cracked into seven rays that shot outward, stitching new constellations whose outlines spelled the emotions he had tried to quantify. [638]
Alone now, Quince stood in the topaz workshop under a restored sky, his own heart blank as unprinted paper, perfectly weightless and suddenly terrifying. [677]
He set a single fresh sheet, inked only with his name set backwards, and pulled the handle, printing himself faint but legible, the first edition of a man who would never borrow another soul. [726]
Outside, the stars burned steadily, having learned the equation they were always meant to solve: that to shine is to be alone together, and to feel is to let others go. [766]
Quince turned off the lamps, locked the dome, and walked down the cliff path carrying the cracked halo fragment in his pocket, a reminder that the mathematics of emotion ends not in proof but in release. [812]
