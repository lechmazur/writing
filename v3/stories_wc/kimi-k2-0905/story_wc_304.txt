The beautician mortician stood at the edge of the skyborne grotto, her reflection fractured across a thousand crystal stalactites that dripped with starlight. [24]
She had come here every night for seven years, ever since the first client whose face she could not save, to practice the art of finding patterns in static—the way dead skin cells arranged themselves like constellations, the way rigor mortis traced maps across cooling flesh. [56]
Tonight the aurora pulsed overhead in sheets of violet and gold, painting the floating garden of ice orchids and cloud moss with a radiant hush that made her breath catch like a held note. [82]
In her palm lay the emerald chip, no larger than a raindrop, carved from the tear duct of the last dragon whose funeral she had overseen; it held within its facets the final spark of bioluminescence that once danced beneath translucent scales. [118]
She needed that spark before oblivion swallowed it, the same way oblivion had swallowed her sister’s laugh, her mother’s perfume, the way it would soon swallow her own name. [150]
The grotto itself was a threshold of stillness suspended between atmospheres, where sound folded in on itself and time moved like honey through a sieve. [183]
Here, she could be lucidly watchful without the city’s grief pressing against her ribs, could observe how the dead taught the living to arrange beauty as a shield against forgetting. [218]
She knelt beside the mirror pool fed by condensation from the aurora, its surface trembling with color, and began to infuse the emerald chip with the static patterns she had harvested from three hundred and forty-two corpses. [264]
Each pattern was a fingerprint of final thought: the widow who died mid-sentence planning her husband’s favorite soup, the child who clutched a marble galaxy, the poet whose last heartbeat spelled an unfinished haiku. [308]
She brushed them into the chip with a sable wand made from her own cut hair, whispering their names so the spark would recognize its companions in the dark. [344]
The aurora dimmed, contracting to a single ribbon that threaded through the grotto like a needle pulling night behind it. [370]
In that sudden hush, she saw her own face reflected—not in the pool, but inside the emerald, older than she remembered, eyes wide as empty bell jars. [398]
The beautician mortician understood then that the spark she sought to capture was not theirs but her own, the last ember of wonder that had led her to paint lips on the deceased, to curl eyelashes for graveside photographs, to believe beauty could be a ferryman across the river of forgetting. [456]
She pressed the chip against her sternum, feeling the static patterns rearrange themselves into a map of every hand she had held while skin cooled beneath her fingertips. [492]
The threshold of stillness widened, grotto walls breathing like lungs, and she stepped forward into the mirror pool, shoes dissolving into color. [520]
Water—or whatever element the pool truly was—rose to her ankles, her knees, her heart, each ripple a syllable of the names she had spoken. [548]
The emerald chip melted against her skin, green light threading through her veins until she became a lantern, lucidly watchful from within her own circuitry. [580]
Above, the aurora flared once more, not as spectacle but as recognition, acknowledging the transaction: one life surrendered to keep three hundred and forty-two sparks alive inside the lattice of her bones. [620]
She did not sink; she dispersed, particles of radiant hush drifting upward to seed new constellations among the ice orchids. [648]
In the morning, city coroners would find her studio empty, scissors poised mid-air, a single emerald chip on the counter that, when held to the light, showed a woman smiling as she dissolved into aurora. [700]
And somewhere in the skyborne grotto, the threshold of stillness breathed with new lungs, waiting for the next beautician mortician who would learn to find patterns in static, to infuse the dead with living light, to capture one last spark before oblivion, and to discover that the only ferryman is the one who becomes the river.
