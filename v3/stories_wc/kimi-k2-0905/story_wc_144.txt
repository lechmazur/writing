The mist-coated rail depot hissed with dawn steam as Lira set her toolbox beside the hummingbird drone whose glass wings had cracked on its last courier run. [30]
She was the depot’s only repair artisan, blind since the boiler explosion of '92, yet she refused to let darkness stop her from overseeing every bolt and filament in her shop. [48]
Instead of sight, she read repairs by examining light refraction through water features: a row of suspended glass drippers that bent sunrise into singing spectra against her fingertips. [72]
The drone’s broken wing threw a jagged rainbow, telling Lira the fracture ran deeper than the shell; the internal lumen-veins that guided its flight were torn. [96]
Outside, a horn sounded—low, oceanic—announcing that the anchor lifts for the ship Aurora’s maiden voyage had begun, the same ship scheduled to carry her drone north with medical seeds. [125]
If the drone could not be patched before that anchor cleared the harbor, an entire village would wait another season for antidotes. [148]
Lira’s motivation was never money; it was to decode feedback into direction, to let every broken thing teach her where to bend metal or mind next. [175]
She breathed the magnetic calm that always filled her when urgency and skill aligned, the feeling of iron filings sliding into perfect order under an invisible force. [204]
Her apprentice, Col, hovered nervously. [213]
“Tell me the hue at dripper three,” Lira said, voice steady. [230]
Col hesitated. [233]
“Copper bleeding into violet,” he answered. [241]
That confirmed internal stress; the drone’s micro-battery was swelling, pressing outward like a second heart that had forgotten its rhythm. [270]
Lira turned the drone over, feeling the warm thrum of its dying engine against her palm, and began to patch the wing with a film of molten silica drawn from her kiln. [305]
She worked in darkness she no longer feared, guiding the bead of glass along the fracture while listening to the changing pitch of the depot’s distant boiler, using its steady hush as a metronome for her hands. [354]
With each pass, she tilted the drone so Col could report shifts in the spectrum. [378]
“More green now,” he whispered, excited. [389]
Green meant the silica had married the original lattice, stress easing, light flowing true. [410]
Yet when she activated the test pulse, the drone jittered sideways, lumen-veins flickering like a panic. [435]
The fracture was healed, but the drone’s feedback loop screamed nonsense, a Morse of fear it had learned when it crashed. [463]
Lira stilled, palms floating above the trembling machine, remembering her own first night in the infirmary after the explosion, bandaged eyes interpreting every sound as threat or promise. [503]
To decode feedback into direction, she must teach the drone to translate its terror into torque. [531]
She asked Col to wheel in the rain barrel kept for quenching, then had him stir the surface until it shattered sunlight into restless confetti. [565]
Lira lowered the drone until its wings almost kissed the water, letting ripples paint moving halos across its sensors. [595]
The jitter slowed; the machine tasted the motion of light and mirrored it, wings adjusting micro-by-micro to the same magnetic calm that steadied Lira’s own pulse. [635]
She patched the final layer: a translucent map of refractive grooves that would forever remind the drone how to read chaos and answer with balance. [675]
Col checked the depot clock. [685]
“Anchor’s up; ship casts off in seven minutes,” he warned. [702]
Lira activated the launch pulse; the drone lifted, hovered, then looped a perfect silver arc around her head, wings humming a note like gratitude. [740]
She opened the bay door, feeling sea breeze cut through the mist, and the drone shot toward the harbor, a tiny artificial star racing to meet the Aurora before its maiden voyage claimed the horizon. [800]
