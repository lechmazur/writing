The cordless phone crackled like a throat full of ice as Dr. Mara Vale pressed it to her ear, crouched between rows of moon-white mandrake in the herbalist’s underground garden. [32]
She had come to the catacombs beneath the city greenhouses posing as a soil chemist, but her real quarry was the moth-winged thing locals glimpsed above the frostbitten rooftops each dawn. [47]
Static surged, then resolved into a child’s voice confessing, “I let it bite me so I could fly,” the words orbiting Mara’s head like gravitationally playful fireflies. [65]
She noted the timestamp—three hours after the missing return changed, that moment last winter when every vanished hiker stumbled out of the pines speaking in perfect unison about “harmony untamed.” [85]
The arrowhead lay beside the phone, a sliver of flint no bigger than her thumb, etched with spirals that matched the bruise on her own shoulder she never remembered getting. [104]
Mara pocketed it, feeling the bitter chill of betrayal; the university had sent her to debunk the sightings, yet the voices on the phone kept calling her by a childhood nickname no colleague knew. [125]
She whispered into the receiver, “Tell me how to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke,” and the static laughed back, a sound like snow collapsing. [143]
Overhead, the glass ceiling of the underground garden fogged, mimicking breath; the herbalist had fled weeks ago, leaving only a note: When the plants start singing, run upward. [165]
Instead, Mara stayed, recording every confession the phone disgorged—fragments of people who had metamorphose into something winged and laughing and cruelly kind. [183]
Each tale carried frostbitten hope, the kind that believes spring is worth the thaw even if bones snap in the process. [198]
On the seventh night, the arrowhead began to warm, tugging her hand toward a planter of frost-kissed henbane whose flowers rotated like slow planets. [218]
She pressed the flint to the soil; roots wriggled up to embrace it, and the cordless phone screamed with joy. [235]
The spiral bruise on her shoulder unfurled into velvet scales that shimmered ultraviolet, gravitationally playful, pulling her knees toward the ceiling though she remained upside-down. [256]
Mara understood: the harmony untamed was not a song but a punch line, and she was the setup. [272]
Static voices merged into one chorus chanting, “Deliver the flint to the sky; break the sky so the missing can finish their joke.” [292]
She climbed the spiral staircase of living vines, each step echoing with frostbitten hope, until she emerged onto the rooftop where dawn bled pale green. [314]
The moth-winged thing waited, taller than the water tower, compound eyes reflecting every face of every hiker who had vanished and returned changed. [334]
It extended a clawed hand; in its palm lay her own missing memory—a winter night when, age ten, she had wished on a snowflake to become the universe’s favorite trick. [357]
Mara placed the flint arrowhead against the creature’s palm; the two fused, erupting into laughter that sounded like every confession spilled through the static-laden phone. [378]
Her human form cracked open like river ice, and she felt herself metamorphose into something vast, antennae tasting starlight, wings beating in 3/4 time. [398]
Below, the city woke to find every rooftop coated in spiral frost; people stepped outside laughing without knowing why, bitterness evaporating into shared cosmic punch lines. [420]
She circled once, twice, gravitationally playful, tugging telephone wires into cat’s cradles that spelled out: harmony untamed is just another name for love that refuses to behave. [445]
The moth-winged chorus—now her chorus—sang that the missing had never been lost; they had simply rehearsed the joke until the delivery was perfect. [465]
Mara dipped a wing, scattering flint-dust that settled on shoulders like benedictions, turning old grief into glitter. [482]
As the sun fully rose, she felt the last of her bitterness evaporate, rising as frostbitten hope that would later fall as snow, each flake carrying a whispered confession for whoever next picked up an old cordless phone. [507]
She glanced earthward once more: the underground garden had bloomed through the pavement, mandrakes singing in uproarious falsetto, herbalist’s note now reading, Thanks for getting the punch line. [532]
Then Mara banked toward the stratosphere, arrowhead heart ticking like a metronome, guiding the newly winged city to rehearse its next cosmic joke. [555]
Somewhere in the static, a new voice—maybe hers, maybe the world’s—confessed, “I was afraid of change until change made me the laugh track.” [575]
The harmony untamed swelled, no longer frostbitten but incandescent, and she joined it, a researcher no longer undercover but over-everything, finally part of the data she once chased. [600]
