The interregnum began the night the palace clocks stopped, leaving the city suspended between two reigns like a breath held too long. [24]  
In the whispering gallery beneath the abandoned throne room, Mara knelt beside the only chessboard the looters had overlooked—ebony and maple, every pawn missing, the remaining pieces arranged as if mid-game. [46]  
She had once been paid to cry on cue for drills, a crisis actor rehearsing tragedies that never happened, until the day the bombs were real and her tears learned their own script. [77]  
Now she survived by walking patterns that spelled forgotten names across the marble, a nomadic penumbra drifting just outside the circles of lantern light where patrols never thought to look. [104]  
Each footstep was a letter, each corridor a sentence; she composed histories in stride, archiving the way a scullery maid’s fingers had once trembled handing a queen her tea, how the captain’s voice cracked giving the evacuation order nobody obeyed. [143]  
Tonight the gallery itself whispered back, stone mouths shaping vowels of air that tasted like iron and lilac. [165]  
“Record us,” they sighed, “before the next king rewrites us into silence.” [180]  
Mara understood the bargain: to become the historian of small gestures she would have to be benevolently ruthless, preserving what softness she found by cutting it free of context that might someday shame it. [220]  
She unbound the lace from her left boot, tied it around the white queen’s neck like a tiny noose, and set the piece on the farthest square; a vow that memory would hang before it would lie. [256]  
The chessboard, missing its pawns, mirrored the city—commoners fled or dead, only hierarchies left to play themselves out in luminous absence. [280]  
She began her next walking sentence: heel-toe-pause-toe-heel, spelling “remember” in the old alphabet whose letters looked like wingbones. [307]  
Halfway through the second syllable she heard boots entering the gallery, deliberate, tracing her own trail backward as if reading spilled ink. [332]  
The patrol leader stepped into the lantern glow: Kestrel, the boy who had once borrowed her staged terror for a training film, now wearing the insignia of no kingdom, only the interim wolf. [368]  
His rifle hung loose, but his eyes held the same rehearsed blankness she had worn for years; she wondered if he saw in her the first real thing he had ever been asked to shoot. [400]  
Instead of raising the weapon he kicked a knight, sending it skittering to her feet; the offer was a move in a game whose rules they invented breath by breath. [428]  
Mara picked up the knight, felt its carved mane sharp against her palm, and completed the word—heel-toe-pause-toe-heel—until “remember” encircled them both, a moat of letters. [462]  
Kestrel lowered himself onto one knee, placed the muzzle gently against the empty square where a pawn should stand, and spoke the first unrehearsed line of his life: “Tell me the name of the maid who dropped the teacup.” [512]  
Mara answered by beginning a new walk, slower, spelling “Adel,” the maid who had smiled at him once when he was still a boy pretending to guard a door no one threatened. [544]  
The gallery carried the name outward, stone throats softening consonants until the air itself seemed to curtsy. [564]  
In that luminous absence of gunfire, they took turns moving the remaining pieces, not to win but to extend the game until dawn, when the next ruler’s heralds would arrive and the city would choose which stories to keep. [608]  
When the first bird outside called the hour that no clock measured, Mara wrapped the chessboard in her cloak; its missing pawns were gaps only the living could fill. [638]  
Kestrel slung his rifle across his back, useless now against the kingdom of small gestures they had declared between them. [660]  
Together they walked the final sentence, footsteps overlapping so the word they shaped could only be read by someone following them at the exact angle of their combined shadows. [692]  
The gallery closed its stone mouths behind them, satisfied, already rehearsing the whisper it would release centuries later when another interregnum arrived and a different seeker found the board with lace around the queen. [738]  
Mara did not look back; she carried the nomadic penumbra inside her, a moving eclipse that revealed by hiding, benevolently ruthless, ready to unbind the next small truth the moment history threatened to harden. [772]
