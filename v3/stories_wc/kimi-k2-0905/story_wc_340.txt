The elevator’s brass cage shuddered upward through the icebound spire, each floor a frost-lensed heartbeat closer to the sky. [24]
As the servant, Lira, rose ten floors toward the captain’s observatory, she clutched the polished goggles that had been left on her polishing tray like an accusation. [44]
Their cracked leather strap still carried the scent of engine-oil and bergamot, the ghost of the airship captain who had leapt from the spire’s pinnacle a week earlier, leaving only rumors of a fatal wager with gravity. [73]
Lira’s warmly inquisitive nature—an inconvenient curiosity that had elevated her from scullery to parlour in six short months—itched to know why he had smiled on the way down. [97]
Between the ninth and tenth floors the elevator lamps flickered, and scattered light from the ice facets outside refracted through the goggles’ left lens, projecting a trembling cipher of symbols across the satin wall. [129]
She traced them: concentric circles, a staircase of primes, a single word—UNFOLD—repeating like breath. [149]
The elevator dinged; the tenth floor corridor smelled of cold iron and old paper. [167]
Lira slipped the goggles on, felt the world tint amber, and stepped into the abandoned observatory where snow drifted through the broken glass dome and settled on the captain’s encrypted diary like a soft apology. [203]
Pages had blown everywhere; she gathered them with the same methodical care she once used to fold the duke’s cravats, noticing that every sheet bore the same water-stain shape of a laughing mouth. [236]
She arrayed the pages on the freezing brass table, aligning edges until the stain formed a continuous spiral that, viewed through the goggles, resolved into a musical staff. [267]
Humming the notes, she heard beneath the mournful melody a quicker, brighter counter-rhythm—joy disguised as ornament, anguish dressed in confetti. [292]
A gust slammed the door; the pages lifted, rearranged themselves, and suddenly the diary’s lock clicked open as if the book itself had waited for this exact draught of air. [323]
Inside, the captain’s last entry was not a confession but a map: a route descending the spire’s maintenance ladders, past forgotten ballrooms and furnace lungs, ending at a sub-basement hothouse where he had cultivated, behind iron bars, a single apricot tree blooming in defiance of perpetual winter. [373]
He wrote that every winter he climbed to the roof to taste the wind’s metal, knowing the tree waited below, its roots drinking heat from the planet’s molten sigh, proof that delight could be smuggled into sorrow’s fortress. [417]
Lira felt the goggles warm against her cheeks, lenses fogging with her breath, and understood the wager: he had not jumped to die but to deliver the seed of that joy outward, trusting the wind to scatter it. [459]
She closed the diary, strapped the goggles around her neck like a promise, and took the elevator back down—not to report to the housekeeper, but to descend the service shafts with a lantern and a gardener’s trowel tucked beneath her apron. [504]
On floor five she passed the duke’s son practicing funeral marches on a frost-bitten piano; the music faltered when she smiled, and for the first time he played a major chord, tentative as sunrise. [541]
On floor two she traded her silver thimble to a boiler stoker for a fistful of coal ash rich in trace heat; he laughed, teeth white against soot, and she stored the sound like a bulb in her chest. [583]
At the sub-basement she found the iron door, lock long rusted away, and stepped into humid air that smelled of apricots and iron-rich earth, the tree glowing under a skylight of frozen cloud. [622]
She knelt, unfolded the captain’s map, and planted the single seed he had taped inside the back cover—an optimistic punctuation mark at the end of his encrypted sentence. [659]
As she pressed ash around the seed, she felt the goggles translate the hothouse’s dimness into scattered light that danced across the walls like children chasing geese, and she laughed with them, affectionately detached from the grief that had brought her here, yet tethered to the joy now germinating beneath her palms. [719]
When the elevator climbed again—this time carrying laundry instead of longing—Lira remained below, watering the future with melted ice, a servant no longer ascending but expanding, roots and branches alike. [760]
