The mirror maker stood firmly grounded at the edge of the ruined orchard district, where centuries of thick fog had swallowed whole rows of once-proud apple trees, their skeletal branches clawing upward like supplicants to a sky that had forgotten them. [51]  
Upon the shimmer of twilight frost, she exhaled a plume of silver breath that mingled with the mist, rehearsing the rhythm she would need to recreate the lost boundary between waking and dream. [68]  
In her pocket lay the astronomer’s broken sextant, its arc snapped during a reckless attempt to measure the altitude of a runaway dream that had streaked across the horizon three nights prior. [85]  
That dream—her own—had torn free when she first tried to trap it inside a looking-glass meant to erase boundaries, a mirror whose surface was supposed to dissolve the glass mountains of solitude she had climbed since childhood. [104]  
Without the dream, the mirror remained a dull slab, unable to silver the fog or open any passage; so she had come back to the orchard, the birthplace of every mirror she had ever blown from sand and sighs, to recapture what was hers. [123]  
She knelt between two shattered trunks, pressed the cracked sextant to her heart, and waited until her pulse matched the cadence of frost forming on the rusted gears. [142]  
The mirror maker closed her eyes, remembering the night her mother taught her the old sync: inhale for seven counts of distant starlight, exhale for five counts of grounded earth, let the heart’s mirror swing between them like a pendulum of breath. [162]  
She began, lungs filling with the cold scent of moldy apples and forgotten blossoms, then releasing warm vapor that spun into ghostly petals drifting upward. [180]  
Each cycle stitched a filament of visibility across the fog, a silver seam that quivered like the finest crack in glass mountains seen from afar. [198]  
On the thirteenth breath, the seam tore open, revealing a narrow corridor lined with translucent mirrors reflecting not her face but the runaway dream itself—an aurora of childhood laughter, unfinished lullabies, and the shape of her mother’s hands shaping molten glass. [218]  
She stepped inside, boots crunching frost, and the corridor sealed behind her with a sound like a sigh resigned to memory. [235]  
Ahead, the dream flickered, taunting, always one reflection away. [244]  
She raised the broken sextant, its jagged edge catching the aurora, and realized the instrument was never meant to measure sky but to cut new angles in the heart. [262]  
With a single decisive motion she slashed her palm, letting three drops of blood fall onto the sextant’s arc; the metal drank them, soldered itself whole, and began to glow with soft starlight. [282]  
The mirror maker lifted the restored sextant to her eye, sighted along its beam, and saw the dream hesitate, suddenly tethered by the crimson line of her own pulse. [300]  
Through synchronized breathing, she drew the dream closer—inhale to accept its wild light, exhale to anchor it inside her ribs—until the aurora folded into her chest like silk collapsing into a needle’s eye. [320]  
The corridor of mirrors shivered, boundaries erasing themselves; reflections of orchard, fog, and glass mountains overlapped until every distinction blurred into a single luminous pane. [340]  
She pressed her bleeding palm against the pane, whispering the final clause of the old sync: “What was lost, recreate; what was mine, reintegrate; let no mirror sever me from myself again.” [360]  
Light flared, frost melted into dew, and the ruined orchard district exhaled as if waking from a centuries-long sleep. [378]  
Trees straightened, bark shining like polished obsidian; fog retreated to the horizon, revealing distant glass mountains now rooted in soil rather than sky. [396]  
The mirror maker found herself standing before a single sapling whose leaves were thin mirrors catching the last twilight; in each leaf she saw the runaway dream resting peacefully, no longer fleeing but growing. [416]  
She pocketed the sextant, now cool and ordinary, and understood that to erase boundaries does not mean to destroy them but to breathe them into new forms, firmly grounded yet open to the shimmer of whatever frost may come. [436]  
As night closed its lid over the reborn orchard, she began to walk home, her steps echoing the same seven-five rhythm, ready to blow tomorrow’s glass from sand and steady breath, her dream no longer runaway but orchard-rooted, mirror-bound, and finally hers. [580]
