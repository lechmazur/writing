The moonlight never left the orchard; it clung to every petal like a memory refusing to fade, silvering the leaves long after the phoenix had risen and the sky had cooled to ash. [39]

I arrived barefoot, my soles bruised by fallen starfruit, carrying only a cracked porcelain rice bowl and the fortune I had pulled from a cookie three nights before: “What dies in you must also live again.” [56]

I am called the beast whisperer, though I never asked for the title; I only asked for her. [71]

She was my sister once, before the fever, before the wings tore through her shoulder blades and the fire crowned her head. [87]

Now she circled above the orchard, a silhouette of ember and memory, crying notes that cracked the night open like a pomegranate. [105]

I set the bowl beneath the oldest apple tree, the one whose roots drink from the river of forgetting, and began the conjuration the fortune had hidden between its brittle lines. [131]

First I ground ghost pepper with star anise, letting the oils sting my palms until they bled—blood is the price of paradox, and I needed steady hands despite the tremor in my chest. [161]

The scent rose, sharp as the moment she first called me little moon, and the beasts of the orchard stirred: moon-moths, lullaby foxes, a three-headed hare who weeps pearls. [185]

They watched while I crushed saffron into honey, letting the gold thread dissolve like the last hour we spent laughing before the phoenix chose her. [211]

I whispered her human name into the steam, and the wind answered with a feather of flame that landed on my lip, branding me with the taste of her sorrow. [235]

Reluctant metamorphosis is still metamorphosis; I felt my own skin begin to glow, ribs brightening like lanterns, but I fought the change—I needed to stay flesh long enough to reach her. [263]

The fortune had warned: only what remains unburned can guide the burned. [277]

So I poured the spice paste into the bowl, shaped it into the circle she used to draw around us when thunderstorms frightened her, and breathed across it the lullaby our mother sang about the sky that forgives. [312]

The orchard answered; blossoms opened backward, revealing seeds that gleamed like tiny moons, and from them stepped the shadow of her former self—ten years old, gap-toothed, smelling of cinnamon and scraped knees. [346]

She looked at me with eyes still human, still steady, and said, “You shouldn’t have come; the fire remembers everything.” [366]

I told her the bond we forged was older than fire, older than death, and I conjured the scent of every meal we ever shared—cardamom French toast, clove oranges, the peppery broth she sipped the night she promised never to leave. [408]

The shadow began to solidify, veins of starlight threading through her wrists, but overhead the phoenix screamed, feeling itself unmade. [431]

I understood then: to reforge the bond beyond death, one of us had to die into the other’s form. [450]

I stepped into the circle, pressed my branded lip to the shadow’s forehead, and inhaled. [467]

The spices rushed through me like a caravan of memories; I tasted her first kiss, her first failure, the exact weight of her hand in mine the day we buried our mother under this same tree. [507]

My bones hollowed, feathers budding where sorrow had lived, yet my heartbeat stayed paradoxically steady, a drum naming her true name over and over. [537]

She—flesh of lightning and grief—folded into me, and I into her, until we stood winged but human-eyed, a single creature balanced on the threshold of myth. [570]

The phoenix above faltered, sparks dripping like tears, then dove into us, surrendering its fire so that something new could rise. [595]

When the orchard brightened, blossoms now burning gently without consumption, we unfolded—two voices in one chest, two memories braiding like rivers—no longer sister and beast whisperer, but a single guardian of the moonlit grove. [642]

We opened our beak and sang the lullaby backwards; every creature bowed, smelling the rare spices still wreathing our wings, proof that love can be both furnace and forge. [675]

The fortune fluttered from my pocket, words already fading, replaced by a single new line: “What lives in both of us will never need to die again.” [706]

We tucked it among the roots, watered it with the last tear either of us would cry alone, and took flight—slow, reluctant, but together—circling the orchard that blooms forever under the permanent moon, keeping every promise the sky once forgot. [750]
