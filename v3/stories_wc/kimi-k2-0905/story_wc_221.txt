The observation deck had been sealed for three cycles, but Kael still carried the echo of its silence in his bones. [19]
He pressed his palm to the frost-rimmed window and felt the station hum beneath the shutdown, a lullaby for the blessed pariah who had outlived every scheduled shift. [39]
Outside, the starfield was temporally stretched, each photon arriving like a letter delivered decades late. [58]
Kael’s reflection floated above the glass: a face thinned by relativistic years, eyes ringed with the guilt of surviving. [79]
He had come here tonight because the family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries was the only ritual that still fit inside his hollowed heart. [104]
Mother had begun it the night he was born, drawing Orion’s belt on the back of a ration card so he would always know where home stood among the drift. [133]
Tonight was the thirtieth anniversary of the deck’s closure, and the first since Mother’s pulse flat-lined in the infirmary three decks down. [160]
Kael unfolded the gilded compass rose applique she had sewn to his flight jacket when he earned navigator status; the metallic threads caught the emergency sconce like a dare. [192]
He had never told her that the station’s magnetic core had flipped years ago, that the compass was ornamental, a beautiful lie. [221]
Yet tonight the needle twitched, trembling toward a vector that did not exist on any starchart. [243]
The twitch became a spin, and the spin became a voice—Mother’s voice—leaking through the static of the shutdown intercom. [268]
“True north isn’t a bearing, Kael,” it said, repeating words she had murmured when he first feared the stars. [294]
“It’s the moment you decide confusion is just exploration wearing a mask.” [312]
Kael’s knees buckled; the deck plating felt colder than vacuum. [327]
He opened his sketchbook to the blank page saved for tonight, but the pencil slipped, rolled, and stopped against the base of the old observation console. [354]
When he bent to retrieve it, he glimpsed a sliver of light beneath the maintenance hatch—light that should have died with the shutdown. [382]
The hatch sighed open at his touch, revealing a crawlspace no larger than a coffin, its walls inked with star maps drawn in his mother’s unmistakable hand. [415]
Each map was dated in the margins, consecutive anniversaries stretching back to the year the deck was condemned. [442]
Kael crawled inside, pulling the hatch shut behind him, and the gilded compass rose on his jacket blazed like a miniature sun. [472]
Time dilated the moment the latch clicked; his heartbeat stretched into whale song, and the maps began to move. [495]
Constellations peeled off the walls, wheeling around him in silent procession, rearranging themselves into a corridor of light. [521]
At the far end floated Mother—not aged, not dead, but the age she had been the night she first sketched the sky for him. [548]
She extended her hand; the gilded compass rose burned against his chest, pointing not to a direction but to her. [575]
Kael understood then that the station had never been abandoned, only rotated out of phase with the rest of the universe, a pocket where grief could be temporally stretched until it became something else. [618]
He took her hand, and the corridor folded like paper, sealing the observation deck behind him. [642]
In the hush that followed, the last echo of silence dissolved into the soft scratch of pencil on cardstock: two silhouettes adding new stars to an endless sky. [675]
Years later—though years had lost their meaning—visitors would find the jacket pinned to the outside hatch, gilded compass rose still glinting, needle spinning lazily toward whatever home decided to be next. [718]
They would open the sketchbook left beneath it and see, on the final page, a simple caption: “True north is whoever waits for you to turn confusion into exploration.” [753]
And somewhere inside the folded corridor, Kael and his mother kept drawing, anniversary after anniversary, the night sky never quite finished, always becoming. [800]
