The prismatic escondite shimmered like a bruise inside the sky, its crystalline corridors folding back on themselves while solar flares licked the outer panes. [28]
In the hush between thunder and echo, the bored immortal named Vey drifted, fingertips grazing walls that remembered every footstep centuries before it was taken. [45]
Vey had watched civilizations bloom and collapse the way children watch sandcastles—fun for a moment, then merely grit between toes. [60]
Today, though, the solar storm outside cracked open radio bands, and the corridors answered with low magnetic moans that spelled a single word: goodbye. [78]
Vey paused, dimensionally aware enough to feel the word bend space, curling the floor into a Möbius sigh. [90]
Centuries ago, a mortal lover had whispered that same word and vanished; since then, Vey had sought every possible afterward, finding only more corridor. [105]
The intrigue began when a fragment of black stone—jagged, humming—tumbled from an overhead fold and clinked against Vey’s heel. [118]
It was a cursed amulet fragment, its curse not death but direction: whoever carried it would walk toward the next missing piece, compelled by polar hunger. [133]
Vey, who had tried every cardinal direction including yesterday, felt the fragment’s magnetic field hook the iron boredom in his blood and tug. [147]
He followed, sandals silent on glass that reflected futures where he had already arrived. [158]
Deeper in the escondite, the walls grew choral, colors singing in hushed thunder as solar ions braided through the lattice. [171]
Vey sensed others ahead—mortal technicians who maintained the station, now crouched in a ring around a second shard that hovered, rotating, between them. [186]
Their whispers braided into mutiny: during the storm’s peak, the station’s dimensional anchors would fail; if they seized control, they could redirect the structure into a pocket universe free of immortal oversight. [203]
They spoke of Vey as a relic that might notice, might interfere, might not care—uncertainty sharpening their voices to wire. [216]
Vey stepped into the light, letting the first fragment pulse on his palm; the second shard leapt across air, magnetized, and the two clicked together with a sound like a final heartbeat. [232]
The merged shard showed a vision: a corridor that ended in a simple wooden door, beyond which lay a darkness that even immortality feared. [247]
The technicians froze, caught between awe and the dawning ache of compass needles realigning inside their bones. [259]
Vey addressed them softly, voice riding the storm’s static so only they could hear: “You plan to exile me to endless space, but I am already exiled in endless time; help me open that door, and I will step through so you never see me again.” [280]
Their leader, a woman whose eyes held auroras, asked, “What happens after goodbye?” [291]
Vey smiled, centuries cracking like ice. “I intend to discover.” [299]
Together they walked the mutiny’s path, not to take the station but to reach the door the amulet revealed, magnetic fields guiding their procession like invisible ushers. [315]
Solar plasma painted the walls vermilion; timepieces melted; the hush thickened until footfalls sounded like distant thunder muffled under velvet. [329]
At the predicted moment, anchors failed; corridors twisted, dimensions swapping places like dancers turning partners. [341]
The wooden door stood before them, plain, unadorned, yet the air around it tasted of finality. [353]
Vey turned to the mortals, placed the complete cursed amulet in the leader’s hand; its compulsion transferred, binding her to seek the next fragment across universes, ensuring the station would wander but never anchor under tyrants. [373]
He whispered thanks, then stepped across the threshold. [380]
Darkness folded over him, soft as a lover’s last breath, and the door vanished, leaving the corridor brighter yet somehow emptier. [395]
Inside that dark, Vey felt time peel away like old paint, revealing something unmarked, unmeasured, unruled. [408]
A voice—not sound but orientation—asked whether he wished to remember or to proceed. [418]
Vey chose proceed, and the darkness answered with a silence deeper than any he had known, a hush so complete it rang like thunder across the hollows of his formerly infinite heart. [435]
In the prismatic escondite, the mortals felt the station stabilize, its corridors settling into new angles that always pointed toward elsewhere. [450]
The woman clutched the amulet, now warm, now cold, her future rewritten into restless pilgrimage.
