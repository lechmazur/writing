At the hush of budding hope, when the sky above the verdant parapet blushed with first light, the wise orchard pruner Arin knelt beside the waterfall, fingers stained with sap and soil. [35]  
He pressed an heirloom seed—black as obsidian and veined with silver—against his lips, tasting the memory of every blossom his grandmother once coaxed from its lineage. [53]  
Beyond the cascade, the water’s veil shimmered like a loom, threads of liquid light weaving between worlds, and Arin’s insatiably creative mind saw the pattern: the color of wonder was escaping, bleeding through the weave into places that had none. [80]  
He had come to succor the fading hue, to trap it once more in living grain before the last child forgot how to gasp at sunrise. [98]  
All winter he listened to the city across the gorge, where gray roofs replaced orchards and citizens walked with eyes cast down, chasing only function. [120]  
Their dreams had dulled, and Arin knew the orchard’s next flowering would be final unless he captured essence itself—wonder’s pigment—and grafted it back into the world. [144]  
So he built a loom of living willow, lashing supple shoots into an oval frame that stood waist-high on the parapet, within mist’s reach. [170]  
Each dawn he pruned a single branch, whispering the old names—varieties of apricot, quince, and plum whose flavors once painted tongues with summer. [195]  
The cuttings he wove through the loom, notching heirloom seed into every intersection until the frame became a breathing lattice, roots already drinking from air. [220]  
On the seventh morning, when the bud tips showed the first microscopic flecks of color no spectrometer could name, Arin sat beneath the loom and opened his chest of tools. [248]  
Inside lay blades curved like crescent moons, a tuning fork of bronze, and vials of dew collected from the first minute of equinox—tools for capturing essence the way glass traps sound. [275]  
He struck the fork against stone; its note rang out, radiant hush that stilled even the waterfall, and the loom’s weave answered, vibrating like a throat learning speech. [300]  
Color gathered—coral, indigo, gold—swirling above the seed-knots, searching for escape, but Arin sang the old lullabies his grandmother grafted into him, each syllable a stitch. [328]  
The hues hesitated, coiling into droplets that floated rather than fell, and with shears of polished obsidian he snipped the air itself, cupping wonder in his palms the way one cups fireflies. [355]  
One droplet he touched to the heirloom seed at the loom’s heart; it sank in, silver veins flaring like sunrise under skin, and the entire frame sighed, leaves unfurling in impossible shades. [383]  
Another droplet he pressed against his own eyelid, capturing essence of seeing-as-a-child, and the parapet bloomed beneath his gaze: moss became emerald flame, stone sang bass notes of violet. [412]  
Yet the weave between worlds tugged back, hungry for borrowed brilliance, and Arin felt the loom buckle, willow shoots cracking as the waterfall’s veil widened into a door. [440]  
Through that door he glimpsed the gray city, its citizens pausing mid-stride, noses lifting as color’s perfume crossed the divide for the first time in a generation. [467]  
Arin understood then: to preserve the color of wonder he must let it travel, not hoard it in one seed or one man; the loom was not a cage but a shuttle. [493]  
He flung the remaining droplets high; they burst into silent fireworks that drifted across the gorge, settling on rooftops, windows, and outstretched hands. [520]  
The radiant hush deepened, broken only by laughter—tentonic, then torrential—as children chased hues that slipped through fingers yet stayed inside memory. [546]  
The loom collapsed, its purpose fulfilled, but from its center the heirloom seed sprouted instantly into a sapling whose leaves were every color and whose fruit would be story. [574]  
Arin, suddenly older yet lighter, pruned the sapling with one decisive clip, grafting a single twig onto the air itself; it took, rooting in the invisible, and he smiled. [602]  
Each year thereafter, upon the hush of budding hope, travelers crossing the waterfall’s bridge feel warmth on their faces before the sun has cleared the ridge, and they remember something they never lived: the first time they beheld wonder. [640]  
Arin tends no orchard now; he wanders, insatiably creative, pockets full of heirloom seeds, weaving between worlds with pruning shears and lullabies, ready to succor any place whose colors have grown weary. [675]  
But on the verdant parapet the sapling remains, its roots half in soil, half in dream, leaves chiming like quiet bells whenever a child laughs below, preserving the color of wonder by sharing it, forever radiant, forever hush. [715]
