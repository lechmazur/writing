The dirigible monastery drifted through polar night, carrying its skyborne grotto under aurora like a lantern of ice. [18]  
Inside, Lysandra, the resident beautician mortician, prepared her brushes with the patience of a glacier. [33]  
She was lucidly watchful, for tonight promised a guest unlike any other. [45]  
A bell made of frozen copper rang once, vibrating a radiant hush throughout the bone-lined vaults. [61]  
The hush felt tangible, as though the air had settled on a threshold of stillness no wing could disturb. [80]  
Orderlies wheeled in a crystal coffin holding Admiral Vey, whose heart had stopped mid-command above the clouds. [97]  
Lysandra bowed, not to the rank, but to the silent question every corpse asked her. [112]  
Could beauty outlive breath long enough to matter? [120]  
Her answer was always a wager: to capture one last spark before oblivion. [133]  
She opened a velvet pouch and drew an emerald chip, smaller than a fingernail yet bright as newborn dawn. [152]  
Legend said the gem had fallen when the aurora first kissed the world, carrying the memory of that green fire. [172]  
Lysandra intended to infuse the admiral's still face with this memory. [183]  
But infusion required more than pigment and stone; it demanded alignment with currents no pulse could feel. [200]  
She dimmed the brass globes until only the aurora above the skylight painted ripples across the operating slab. [218]  
Then she tuned an antique radio to the void between stations, chasing whispers by finding patterns in static. [236]  
Snow-crackle, comet-hiss, faint Morse from forgotten expeditions wove into a lattice only her trained ear could trace. [253]  
Within that lattice she sought the admiral's last command, the syllable still echoing somewhere beyond flesh. [269]  
When the frequency pulsed at 3.7 megacycles, his voice emerged like a ship cresting fog: 'Hold fast'. [286]  
She caught the phrase in her breath, grounding it within the emerald chip held to her lips. [303]  
The gem shimmered, refracting auroral green into veins across her gloves. [314]  
Carefully she brushed the first stroke along the admiral's brow, and the room leaned closer, listening. [330]  
Color seeped inward rather than outward, as if the corpse absorbed dawn through secret capillaries. [345]  
Lysandra paused at the threshold of stillness inside herself, a ledge where heartbeat and silence negotiated. [361]  
Crossing it too quickly risked fracturing the spark; lingering too long invited oblivion to notice. [376]  
So she balanced, lucidly watchful, letting aurora, static, and emerald-dialogue find their common chord. [390]  
When chord and silence finally overlapped, a faint warmth rose from the admiral's chest. [404]  
It was not life, but the echo of a life remembering itself. [416]  
In that echo, Lysandra sensed storms he had steered, constellations he had trusted, and regrets he never voiced. [434]  
She painted each memory as a fleck of green radiance along his cheekbones, a map only night could read. [453]  
The orderlies watched, their own breaths drawing frost halos, but none dared interrupt the radiant hush. [469]  
Outside the skylight, curtains of light folded and unfolded like lungs of a sleeping god. [484]  
At the final stroke, Lysandra placed the emerald chip upon the admiral's sternum, sealing the circuit. [500]  
The gem dimmed, its fire willingly imprisoned, while the corpse's face relaxed into purposeful vigilance. [515]  
He looked ready to issue orders to any star brave enough to pass. [528]  
Lysandra exhaled, feeling how close oblivion still hovered, annoyed at losing even this sliver of dominion. [544]  
She whispered a promise to return the spark when the aurora next faded, and the void accepted the bargain. [563]  
The orderlies closed the coffin, yet the emerald glow bled through seams, a navigating light for whatever lay beyond. [582]  
Her work done, Lysandra returned to the radio, letting static flood the chamber until patterns dissolved into pure night. [601]  
Some would call the silence empty, but she knew it as a garden where sparks slept until summoned. [619]  
She cleaned her brushes and watched the aurora ebb, standing again upon that threshold of stillness inside her craft. [638]  
Beyond the skylight, dawn lined the horizon, and for a breath the grotto itself seemed to smile. [655]  
Another corpse would arrive, another gamble begin, but for now she cherished the radiant hush she had preserved. [673]  
High above, the aurora rearranged its greens like flags acknowledging a victory too small for history, yet infinite to the heart it saved. [696]
