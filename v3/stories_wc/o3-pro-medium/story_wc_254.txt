The ban on public verse had finally lifted as winter glassed the northern provinces. [14]  
I journeyed east, hoping for a quiet commission, and instead met the cloud-shadow poet. [28]  
He was leaning against a cobalt atrium by a frozen lake, sketching syllables with breath. [43]  
Every exhale frosted into drifting stanzas that rearranged themselves before melting on the dark ice. [58]  
The air carried a lantern-moth hush, as though the world had dimmed its lamps to listen. [74]  
I asked why he wrote outside, so far from the reopened salons. [86]  
He smiled, saying he preferred edges, places where sound risked falling off the map. [100]  
That is where language begins, he murmured, handing me a stone warm despite the cold. [115]  
The stone pulsed; it was a fragment from the humming quartz colonnade rumored to flank the capital. [132]  
Legends said the columns sang only when truth crossed their thresholds. [143]  
Now, after the ban lifts, he wanted to test whether the song still remembered us. [158]  
I realized his goal matched my own unspoken urge to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. [174]  
We shook hands, sealing a compact of mutual astonishment. [183]  
Night settled, but cobalt panes above us stored twilight like blue coals. [195]  
The poet proposed we travel at dawn, following the lake's silver fault line to the city. [211]  
He claimed the colonnade's hum could repair the tremor of certainty that rattled every liberated voice. [227]  
I did not fully understand, yet his words rang like tuning forks within my ribs. [242]  
We camped inside the atrium, its vaulted ribs mirrored on the lake ice, doubling space. [257]  
Throughout the night he recited drafts, asking me to paraphrase each verse until meaning bled clean. [273]  
Our voices crossed, braided, and thinned, and the panes above dissolved into a field of echoes. [289]  
We were already moving through dissolving boundaries, though neither of us spoke the phrase. [303]  
At dawn the lake cracked like distant drums, urging departure. [313]  
We walked the shore road, every footprint sketched with windblown snow. [324]  
The poet spoke of color palettes no painter had yet ground, mapping sound to hue. [339]  
His hunger was aesthetically driven, not for fame but for an architecture of sensation. [353]  
Listening, I felt the tremor of certainty inside me slow, syncopating with the quartz shard. [368]  
Three days later city walls rose, weathered yet trembling like instruments waiting for touch. [382]  
Crowds returned after the ban, exchanging shy lyrics instead of greetings, fearing censors still hidden. [397]  
The poet knelt, pressing his stone to the cobblestones; a low hum budded underfoot. [411]  
The sound guided us to the plaza where the quartz colonnade had once gleamed. [425]  
War and ordinances had buried it beneath market stalls, but the hum remembered its own pillars. [441]  
Merchants stared as tables rattled; bolts loosened; tarps peeled back like curtains rehearsing revelation. [455]  
From the earth rose milky columns, each veined with living chimes that flickered between solid and song. [472]  
People gasped, yet silence ruled, the lantern-moth hush descending again, velvet and attentive. [485]  
The poet stepped beneath the nearest arch, and the entire colonnade responded, humming in widening rings. [501]  
Vibrations rippled outward, brushing every chest like a second heartbeat, steady and light. [514]  
I felt words dissolve into raw cadence; what remained was a clarity beyond grammar. [528]  
The poet began a new verse, yet not with speech; the columns sang through him. [543]  
Their refrain traveled upward, shaking snow from roofs and doctrine from memory. [555]  
I understood then that certainty itself might tremble not to break us, but to set rhythm for change. [573]  
The gathered townsfolk absorbed the cadence, shoulders loosening as if heavy cloaks were unfastened. [587]  
Someone laughed, a small thing, yet it scattered like seed across the plaza. [600]  
Children began tracing circles around the columns, testing where stone ended and vibration began. [614]  
The poet met my gaze; in his eyes shimmered the lake, the atrium, and every mile between. [631]  
We had walked here to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, and they were now air. [647]  
He offered me his notebook, pages empty, waiting for a world newly versed in resonance. [662]  
I accepted, unsure what to write, yet bearing inside the tremor that promised direction. [676]  
The columns softened, folding back beneath stalls, but their hum lingered under every vendor's song. [691]  
City life resumed, yet a listening lay beneath it, subtle as moonlit pulse. [704]  
When we departed at dusk, the frozen lake mirrored pink fires, and certainty trembled in welcome. [720]
