Mara Vann moved through the dawn fog with the hazy precision she reserved for catastrophic sites. [16]  
The towering labyrinth of shipping containers in the port city rose around her like rusted cliffs. [32]  
Three nights earlier, the harbor lights blinked out and the town went silent, surrendering itself to rumor. [49]  
Now, as appointed accident investigator, Mara alone had authority to cross the police tape. [63]  
Silence drummed louder than any siren. [69]  
She lifted her handheld anemometer to survey the wind sneaking between the metal canyons. [83]  
Documenting wind patterns between buildings was not typical forensic procedure, yet nothing about this job was typical. [100]  
The containers themselves formed temporary buildings, stacked six, sometimes seven stories high, channeling gusts like organ pipes. [117]  
Mara's mentor had taught her that air remembered accidents, if one listened before it dispersed. [132]  
She was here to cultivate foresight in action, not hindsight in reports. [144]  
The data scrolled across her visor, updating with rapidly adapting models that projected invisible vortices. [159]  
Each swirl corresponded to a displacement, a gap where mass had moved too swiftly to be ordinary. [176]  
She suspected a singular convergence of forces had struck, something violent yet exquisitely focused. [190]  
Turning a corner, she found the first body, an elderly dockhand slumped against a blue Maersk wall. [207]  
His radio still hissed, catching only static from a stationless ether. [218]  
Pinned to his jacket was a flight engineer's patch, bright against the soot. [231]  
Flight engineers had no reason to roam freight yards, which meant someone had placed it deliberately. [247]  
Mara bagged the patch, noting the embroidered spiral that mirrored the airflow simulation on her visor. [263]  
A klaxon groaned somewhere above, then fell quiet, like a memory reconsidering its volume. [277]  
She ascended a service ladder to the roof of a red container stack for clearer readings. [293]  
From that height the port city looked evacuated, storefront banners frozen mid-flutter, cranes hanging like arrested pendulums. [310]  
She traced the line of overturned market stalls leading inland, a breadcrumb trail of kinetic release. [326]  
Every clue agreed: energy had tunneled straight through the district, ignoring randomness, heeding geometry. [340]  
Singular convergence, she whispered, feeling the words vibrate more than she sounded them. [353]  
A distant metallic crash answered, as though the maze itself acknowledged her diagnosis. [366]  
She descended and followed a corridor of containers painted with warnings in twenty languages. [380]  
The wind here behaved unnaturally, pausing, then reversing, as if rapidly adapting to unseen choreography. [395]  
Her models updated, showing a null spot ahead: pressure zero, sound zero, motion crushed to stillness. [411]  
At the corridor's center she discovered a clearing where five containers had imploded into a perfect star. [428]  
Their steel walls folded like paper, edges meeting with origami precision around an empty fulcrum. [443]  
Inside the fulcrum lay a single chair welded to the floorplate, bolted harness undone. [457]  
A second flight engineer's patch fluttered on the seat, its spiral soaked with condensed mist. [472]  
Mara realized the patches were beacons, calibration markers for whoever or whatever had harvested the town's momentum. [489]  
The convergence was not an accident but an extraction, a siphon needing surgical calm rather than explosive noise. [507]  
That meant it could return for more, unless someone changed the wind it counted on. [522]  
She set her anemometer to broadcast randomized gust algorithms through the container corridors, scrambling the pathways. [538]  
Fans hidden in emergency junction boxes whirred awake, producing countercurrents that spiraled opposite the embroidered design. [554]  
Steel creaked, complaining as vectors lost their alignment. [562]  
Somewhere above, the null spot fractured, releasing a thunderclap that rolled outward instead of inward. [577]  
Mara braced behind a container door, feeling air rush past her cheeks toward the empty bay. [593]  
She counted heartbeats until the gust settled into normal seaside breezes flavored with distant gull cries. [609]  
The models stabilized, predicting no further convergence within the next thousand hours. [621]  
It was the widest margin of foresight she had ever earned in action. [634]  
Still, she logged every measurement, every improvised fan angle, documenting wind patterns between buildings for whoever investigated her work later. [654]  
She sealed the chair and star-shaped cavity with hazard tape, leaving the second patch pinned to the door as warning. [674]  
Then she walked back through the labyrinth, guided by the rhythm of normal wind and the silence she had saved. [694]
