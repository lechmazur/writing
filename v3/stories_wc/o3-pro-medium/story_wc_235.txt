I unlocked the mountain ranger cabin long after seeing my own grave on the ridge's bleak shoulder. [17]  
The key, still warm from my pocket, felt like evidence that chronology had abandoned me. [32]  
Outside, snowmelt whispered, but inside everything smelled of old coffee, kerosene, and feral nostalgia. [46]  
I am the Service's lucid dream chronicler, dispatched whenever reports of impossible weather overlap with ruptured perception. [63]  
My assignment: distill chaos into narrative before the mindscape avalanches into the waking world. [77]  
But the moment I stepped over the threshold, I got jealous of my past selves, the ones who trusted linear time. [98]  
Their journals never stuttered; mine already flickered like faulty film. [108]  
A birch bark scroll awaited me on the bunk, curled as if grown from the mattress springs. [125]  
Its exterior showed chewed edges, gnawed perhaps by wind, perhaps by memory-starved animals. [138]  
I unrolled it and found my handwriting documenting a thunderstorm scheduled for tomorrow yet described as five years past. [157]  
The paradox made my temples throb with metallic bees. [166]  
Jaded wonder settled over me, thin and itchy like ranger-issue wool. [177]  
I lit the stove anyway, because disbelief offers no calories at altitude. [189]  
Flames popped, and with each pop the walls rearranged their knots into maps of the surrounding peaks. [206]  
A trail traced itself toward a summit I had climbed as a rookie, back when dreams obeyed. [223]  
Memory rose inside me, not gentle, but feral, teeth bared, longing to reclaim the mountain's earlier version of me. [242]  
That longing nudged me to the door before logic could lace its boots. [255]  
Outside, twilight soaked the pines in bruised violet; above, a thermal updraft hummed like an invitation. [271]  
I stepped onto the old fire watch platform and let the wind read my jacket like a sail. [289]  
Gravity argued, but nostalgia, now fully feral, bit through the ropes. [300]  
I soared, first a wobble, then a cleaving ascent that ripped open the sky's stitched seams. [316]  
The range spread beneath me like fresh ink blots waiting for interpretation. [328]  
As I climbed past clouds, I could see two timelines unfurling, parallel but impossible to label as earlier or later. [348]  
On the left drifted a campfire scene from my rookie season, laughter crisp, smoke hopeful. [363]  
On the right hovered the fresh grave I had discovered at dawn, marker carved with my name and tomorrow's date. [383]  
Between them, the birch bark scroll unspooled midair, letters rearranging themselves like migrating birds. [397]  
I knew the script begged for an ending only I could write, but I remained chronologically confused, pen lost somewhere in the wind. [420]  
So I folded my jealousy into a paper plane of breath and launched it toward my laughing younger self. [439]  
He caught it, puzzled, and the moment he unfolded the invisible note, his fire dimmed, as though warned. [457]  
I felt the timeline shudder, a cedar door slammed in a distant bivouac. [470]  
The rookie inhaled, extinguished his campfire, and chose to descend the mountain he had not yet conquered. [487]  
Below me, the gravestone image wavered, date dissolving into a smear of granite possibility. [501]  
I realized, midflight, that jealousy had been the solvent, loosening the stuck gears between is and was. [518]  
The wind applauded as I angled downward, intent on returning to the cabin before the scroll wrote something else. [537]  
When my boots touched the platform again, snow had begun, each flake a blank page itching to be archived. [556]  
Inside, the stove embers glowed like punctuation, urging completion. [565]  
I took out fresh paper, but the only instrument left was charcoal from the hearth. [580]  
Charcoal dirtied the margins, yet the story flowed, every smear proof that revision could outweigh prophecy. [596]  
I wrote that the storm would arrive, but only to wash away footprints, not to bury bodies. [613]  
Outside, thunder grumbled as if negotiating edits with my paragraphs. [623]  
I signed the page with today's date, tomorrow's time, and the comfortingly unstable phrase 'To Be Determined'. [640]  
Then I slipped the birch bark scroll beside the new draft, letting past and present glare at each other like estranged siblings. [662]  
Their rivalry would keep the cabin alive through the night, a generator powered by paradox. [677]  
As the first lightning bolt etched my silhouette on the wall, I felt neither dead nor alive but adequately footnoted. [697]  
That, for a chronicler, is close enough to living. [706]
