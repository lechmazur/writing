The floating rock tea ceremony platform drifted just above the cloud line, a slate saucer against bruised twilight. [18]  
Rain rumbled below like drums in a distant cave, but here the air held a saturated hush. [35]  
A breath between storms glimmered across the horizon, slim as a drawn blade. [48]  
Seren Dov, budding rune scholar of the Windward Collegium, knelt on the warm obsidian tiles. [63]  
She unfurled a roll of rice parchment, its edges dark where lightning had once kissed it. [79]  
Across her forearms scars fanned like pale reeds; she meant today to transform scars into stories. [95]  
That was the promise hidden in each uneven ridge, a promise the Collegium never taught. [110]  
She inhaled slowly, counting runic numerals until the world shrank to a single held breath. [125]  
During a held breath the platform steadied, tethered only by silent incense ropes to nothing at all. [142]  
Mist curled from bronze kettles while Master Yulo poured moon-bloom tea that crystallizes when stressed by sudden cold. [160]  
The shards tinkled in porcelain cups like newborn stars, urging contemplation of sharpness and change. [175]  
Seren accepted her cup but set it aside, drawing instead a crow quill trimmed tip from her sleeve. [193]  
Black as eclipse shadow, the quill had once belonged to the thunder bird she feared as a child. [211]  
She sought insight by revisiting youthful superstitions, not to cower beneath them, but to shed their husks and harvest their seeds. [232]  
Master Yulo watched without reproach; the ceremony welcomed any path that made stillness ring. [246]  
Seren dipped the quill into the crystalline tea, feeling tiny fractures form in the liquid like invisible ice. [264]  
She let a droplet fall onto the parchment, where it froze into a minuscule prism before soaking through. [282]  
The prism burst into runic filaments, lines arranging themselves into the first letter of her grandmother's lullaby. [299]  
Pain echoed in the letter's curve, the memory of nights Seren listened while storms dismantled their wooden roof. [317]  
Back then she believed each thunderclap was the bird demanding its stolen feather, and sleep would invite talons. [335]  
Now she dared to unscroll that fear, place it in daylight, and ink it obedient to her will. [353]  
More droplets rained from the quill, each crystallizing before bursting, each forming another stanza of lived ache. [370]  
Seren sensed her scars warming, rising like braille as if eager to be read at last. [386]  
She wrote their topography faithfully, valleys of hesitation and peaks of misjudged trust, naming every contour. [402]  
Ink cracked, light refracted, and the parchment glowed as if backlit by the first dawn. [417]  
Master Yulo exhaled approval, his breath swirling the mist into temporary dragons that guarded the margins. [433]  
Yet Seren had one ridge left unwritten, a jagged scar across her palm earned in foolish pride. [450]  
Storm wind suddenly rocked the platform, reminding everyone the pause between tempests was nearly spent. [465]  
Time bent thinner; even the incense smoke seemed unable to choose a direction. [478]  
Seren pressed the quill to her open palm, letting a bead of blood mingle with crystalline tea. [495]  
The mixture hissed, crystallizes when stressed, then softened into shimmering vermilion ink made of both wound and remedy. [513]  
She wrote a single concluding rune that meant restoration through remembering, a rune nonexistent in any sanctioned lexicon. [531]  
As the ink settled the rune began to hum, and the platform descended several breaths until it hovered over rain. [551]  
Thunder answered like applause, yet no fear returned; Seren had negotiated with it, turned demand into dialogue. [568]  
In that moment her scars felt light, as if they could lift and drift away, but she would not let them. [589]  
She wished instead to bear them as lanterns, evidence of nights survived, fuel for stories yet unwritten. [606]  
Around her, tea cups chimed as the crystals melted, releasing fragrant steam that carried new words into the wind. [625]  
The ceremony concluded not with dismissal but with collective silence, everyone breathing the same transformed air. [641]  
Only when the first raindrop struck the parchment did Seren finally exhale, letting the story belong to weather. [659]  
The platform lifted again on columns of warm air, and new storms gathered, waiting their turn to be translated. [678]
