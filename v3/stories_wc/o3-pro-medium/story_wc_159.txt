Mist drifted like torn veils around the opal library above clouds, where silence tasted sweet. [15]  
Inside, Orielle, sworn glass-orchid caretaker, began her dawn inspection. [24]  
Every blossom sculpted from mineral petals held memories instead of nectar. [35]  
Orielle's task was to prevent those fragile memories from shattering into snow. [47]  
She moved with a gently systematic grace learned from extinct gardeners' manuals. [59]  
Yet foxglove regret colored her thoughts each morning. [67]  
For the orchids whispered on nights when the moon forgot its face. [79]  
They murmured deserted marvels no visitor arrived to witness. [88]  
Whole halls of brilliance lay unsought beyond the reading terraces. [98]  
Today, Orielle paused beneath a wind chime bamboo tube cracked at the seam. [111]  
The crack made the chime's voice waver like aging bronze. [121]  
It threatened the harmony that kept drifting knowledge from unraveling. [131]  
Orielle lifted the chime toward the skylight to study the wound. [142]  
Light sifted through the opalescent glass and scattered prisms across her gloves. [154]  
Within those colors she read a subtle map singing of repair. [165]  
She would mend the tube not with resin, but by the echo of a long-forgotten song. [181]  
The library catalog listed thousands of notes preserved in crystalline grooves. [192]  
Orielle traced the aisle of sonic fossils toward the section labeled 'Unnamed Farewells'. [205]  
Each recording was once a farewell spoken in tongues now erased from living speech. [219]  
Their collective hush formed what curators called the museum of extinct feelings. [231]  
Across the museum of extinct feelings, she heard a hush that matched the cracked bamboo's pitch. [247]  
She set the cylinder on an ancient gramophone carved from cloudbone. [258]  
A trembling melody rose, delicate as mist over ruins. [267]  
Notes curled around the library's spiraling columns, stirring dust into constellations. [278]  
Orielle held the bamboo tube in that airflow, letting the song bleed through the fissure. [293]  
Gradually the crack glimmered, edges knitting like dawn closing a wound across night. [306]  
When the final note faded, the chime hung perfect, renewed and resonant. [318]  
But something else had awakened in that resonance. [326]  
A corridor previously locked shimmered open, revealing staircases spiraling downward into violet haze. [339]  
Legend claimed those stairs led to deserted marvels no steward had dared revisit. [352]  
Glass orchids rustled behind Orielle, petals clinking like cautious bells. [362]  
She sensed their plea: descend, discover, remember. [369]  
Her own motive already burned—to preserve the sound of forgotten names before they dissolved forever. [384]  
Carrying the restored chime as lantern, she began the descent. [394]  
The stairwell walls were lined with mirrors fogged by centuries of unspoken sorrow. [407]  
Each step triggered soft reflections of travelers who had once searched for solace. [420]  
Orielle noticed many faces lacked mouths, erased when their languages died. [431]  
She rang the bamboo chime, and the newly healed timbre filled those hollows. [444]  
Where the sound touched, silhouettes regained lips and whispered their own names with trembling awe. [459]  
The names fluttered upward like bright moths, racing back toward the library's vaulted ceiling. [473]  
Each flutter left behind a seed of voice that planted itself in the mirrors. [487]  
Soon the stairwell hummed with newborn syllables, a garden of echoing speech. [499]  
Orielle felt the foxglove regret inside her soften, transforming into purpose. [510]  
She understood the deserted marvels were never meant to remain unvisited; they awaited the right harmony. [526]  
Returning upward, she guided the rescued names to roost within glass orchids, each bloom a living archive. [543]  
The library brightened as though dawn had lit every shelf. [553]  
Visitors, sensing the change, would soon arrive along the windbridges from distant cloud cities. [567]  
They would hear the restored chime and know stories awaited whose tellers were reborn. [581]  
Orielle placed the bamboo chime beside the entrance so first feet would cross beneath music. [596]  
Then she knelt among the orchids and listened to their crystalline voices pronounce gratitude. [610]  
Gratitude answered her longing, but a trace of foxglove regret remained, reminding her of work ahead. [626]  
For countless names still slept in dust, waiting for the right caretaker to light their way. [642]  
She rose, gently systematic hands already arranging tomorrow's tools. [651]  
Above, the opal vault sang with new vowels, while far below the stairwell mirrors bloomed. [666]  
The library had become both archive and garden, nurtured by the echo of a long-forgotten song. [682]  
And Orielle, glass-orchid caretaker, smiled at the newly awakened marvels, determined they would never be deserted again. [699]
