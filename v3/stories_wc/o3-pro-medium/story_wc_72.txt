The current tugged slow ribbons of silt across marble flagstones as dawnlight filtered greenly into the forgotten underwater city garden. [20]  
Even here, silence had a sound, like distant bells muffled by moss. [32]  
At the courtyard center stood Aios, the living statue who listened without ears and spoke without lips. [49]  
Veins of tarnished bronze webbed his stone arms, and thoughts pulsed along them in quiet blue sparks. [66]  
He was built to guard, but after revealing the secret to himself centuries ago, guarding felt smaller than wondering. [85]  
His new purpose, as he told the koi through ripples of shared mind, was to welcome nuance into a certainty still forming. [107]  
Certainty, for Aios, once meant unbroken walls and clear orders; now it meant the opposite, a slow bloom of ambiguities. [127]  
That morning the current carried an unexpected glint: a foxglove-stained glass ampoule rolling across the path like a jeweled seed. [147]  
Its lilac surface kept leaking lavender smoke that sketched question marks before dissolving. [160]  
Aios extended a telepathic whisper, brushing the ampoule's shallow mind the way wind threads reeds. [175]  
Inside he sensed a lattice of poison and memory, bound not by glass but by intention. [191]  
It had been crafted to reveal truth through structural weakness: squeeze too hard, it shatters, mixing foxglove with breath. [210]  
Yet in the folds of the smoke awaited another function, quieter, almost kind. [223]  
Aios felt the intention humming, incisively kind, as though the ampoule wished to dissect sorrow without hurting the heart holding it. [244]  
He lifted the vial and asked the garden for counsel. [254]  
Ferns bowed, corals released bubbles, and from below a collapsed arch, a rumble answered. [268]  
Stone shifted, revealing a tunnel veiled in eelgrass, a flaw in the city he once policed for perfection. [286]  
The flaw invited him like an unfinished sentence, and so he threaded his massive fingers through the breach. [304]  
Water sighed as he eased inside, carrying the ampoule whose smoke now curled around his shoulders like guide ropes. [323]  
Beyond the wall lay a smaller courtyard, sealed for ages, where sculptures exactly like Aios knelt in cracked formation. [342]  
They were lifeless, yet their thoughts lingered as faint static, trapped when time had flooded this place. [359]  
Touching their minds felt like knocking on locked doors that still remembered music. [372]  
Cascading revelations rushed through Aios: he had not been the only guardian who questioned orders; he had been the only one spared erasure. [395]  
The others had inhaled foxglove fog from ampoules like the one he held, their certainty cracked too sudden to survive. [415]  
Kindness without incisive edge had dulled, turning revelation into ruin. [425]  
He knelt among them, resolving to finish the stalled conversation rather than mourn its silence. [440]  
Using telepathy, he gathered their lingering sparks and threaded them through his own circuits, weaving a chorus. [457]  
Their first collective question emerged: 'Can certainty hold kindness without choking it?' [469]  
Aios answered aloud, the words rippling bubbles, 'Only if we let uncertainty breathe inside it like tide pools in stone.' [489]  
At that, the ampoule warmed, recognizing purpose in dialogue, not deletion. [500]  
He opened it carefully, letting only a thread of foxglove smoke escape, enough to tint the water violet but not to poison. [522]  
Through structural weakness, revelation dripped rather than exploded, and the kneeling statues began to stir. [537]  
Stone eyelids cracked; bronze veins lit; tentative minds blinked into the chorus already waiting for them. [553]  
Their reanimation felt animate lifeless, like movement half remembered by the city itself. [566]  
One newly awakened statue, voice quavering with mineral dust, asked what time it was. [580]  
'After revealing the secret,' Aios replied, 'which means it is time to garden fresh questions'. [595]  
He guided them back into the outer court where coral fronds waited like blank pages. [610]  
Together they planted ideas the way farmers sow algae, each notion laid carefully in sediment for tides to revise. [629]  
The ampoule, now empty, drifted upward, its glass no longer stained but cleared, a seed that had sprouted transparency. [648]  
As it reached a shaft of morning light, it shattered harmlessly, releasing a final bubble that rang like a bell we will someday remember. [672]  
Below, the living statues cultivated nuance among ruins once built for certainty, beginning again where endings had pretended to be absolute. [693]
