Dust curdled in the lantern beams as Liora descended the spiral stair, a reckless idealist chasing impossible mercy. [18]
She had vowed, with fiercely gentle stubbornness, to patch holes in the soul that grief had shredded. [35]
That vow drew her tonight toward the catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones. [50]
Legends claimed destinies could be bartered there, if one arrived bearing both truth and loss. [65]
Liora's truth was a burned tarot card, the last relic of her sister Mira's unfinished future. [81]
Her loss was obvious in the tremor that lived behind her dusky resolve. [94]
Within the glow of half-lit corridors that veined the crypt, roots glimmered like veins of onyx. [110]
She followed their black shimmer until the tunnel opened into the orchard, ceiling collapsed wide to starlight. [127]
Trees rose from skull-studded soil, limbs bearing pale apples that whispered with every sluggish wind. [142]
Beneath one tree waited the Keeper, a slight figure whose shadow spread longer than lantern light allowed. [159]
Eyes like smoked glass studied Liora, measuring courage, measuring cost. [169]
"You know the rule," the Keeper murmured, voice dry as pages. [180]
"Destiny is never given, only traded, and every trade leaves a bruise." [192]
Liora placed the burned tarot card upon a protruding femur, its charred Sun arcana cracked but readable. [209]
"I offer what remained of Mira's path," she said, breath fumbling. [220]
"Take mine instead, and let her story continue beyond the fire." [231]
The Keeper knelt, fingertips brushing the card, inlaying meaning everywhere their nails touched the scorched surface. [247]
Symbols shimmered, rearranging like embers caught in a sighing draft. [257]
Liora felt the orchard listen, a hush that threatened to trammel even her heartbeat. [271]
"Your sister's thread still burns," the Keeper said. [279]
"But flame needs fuel; offer more than memory if you wish the loom to weave again." [295]
Liora understood destiny was currency, and hers had weight only if lived. [307]
So she spoke the hidden chapters she had dreamed but never dared: the clinic she would build, the laws she would shatter, the children she would shelter from smoke and sirens. [338]
Every word left her lighter, yet lonelier, as though her own silhouette were thinning into candle fog. [355]
The pale apples quivered, absorbing hopes like dew. [363]
Finally, the Keeper sliced one fruit, and its seeds spilled out as tiny obsidian mirrors reflecting futures just confessed. [382]
"Choose one," the Keeper instructed, "and swallow." [389]
Reckless instinct lunged forward before fear could counsel; Liora picked a seed that glinted like dawn through charcoal. [407]
It tasted of sunlit scaffolds and midnight sirens, sweet with possibility, bitter with cost. [421]
Heat rushed along her veins; in its wake, scenes rearranged, Mira laughing again, the fire never happening. [438]
But another vision flickered: herself, older, scarred, wandering empty wards because no dream guided her footsteps. [454]
The trade had worked; destinies were bartered, and she had given her future to her sister. [470]
A sob rose, raw but resolute. [476]
The Keeper offered a second seed, darker, cracked, a shard of consequence. [488]
"Take this as ballast," they said, "else the void behind your ribs will yawn wider." [503]
Liora accepted, though her hands trembled like leaves near winter. [513]
Swallowing, she felt not heat but weight, a gravity that anchored the torn edges inside her. [529]
The bruising was immediate, yet it stitched a faint seam along the emptiness. [542]
Around them the orchard exhaled, and roots released a sigh of bone fragments settling. [556]
"Go," whispered the Keeper, "before dawn goldens the marrow and closes the market." [569]
Liora turned back through the half-lit corridors, her lantern dimmed yet steady. [581]
Each step echoed against the crypt walls, inlaying meaning everywhere sound could cling. [594]
She feared the world above might trammel her resolve, but the ballast burned softly, reminding her of purpose. [612]
Mira would breathe outside hospital walls, unaware of this midnight bargain; that was enough. [626]
Yet Liora also sensed blank pages waiting for her, spaces where a new story could root. [642]
She would cultivate it carefully, fiercely gentle with herself, refusing to let self-pity poison the budding shoots. [659]
Outside, dawn began smearing iron clouds with rose, but deep below, the orchard settled back into shadowed silence. [677]
Destinies had been bartered, holes patched, and somewhere a burned tarot card cooled into harmless ash. [693]
In the quiet between heartbeats, dusky resolve bloomed anew, fragile yet alive. [705]
