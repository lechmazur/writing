The service call came through long after midnight, addressed to Marlen Ortiz, the only elevator repair technician still awake in the county. [22]  
The dispatcher said the location was the abandoned circus ticket office that crouched like a rusted spider at the edge of town. [44]  
Marlen accepted, driven by his private motivation to discover what ceilings hide, a quest that had followed him through shafts and attics for years. [68]  
He was, after all, skillfully observant; noticing a loose screw or a shard of bone came as naturally as breathing. [88]  
And Marlen saw ghosts, transparent stowaways drifting beside counterweights, granting him companionship and warnings in equal measure. [105]  
The ticket office greeted him with wind-whistled posters, their clowns peeling like tired paint, exposing cracks in the facade deeper than mortar. [127]  
He stepped inside precisely when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off, timing that felt choreographed by the building's lingering spirit. [147]  
The silence that followed carried a weightless burden, as though gravity remembered kindness for one fragile moment. [164]  
Still, work awaited, and Marlen engaged the dusty breaker panel, feeding sleepy volts into the dormant lift system at the back of the office. [188]  
Cobwebs twitched as current flowed, and a whispery audience of ghosts materialized, their carnival costumes faded to opalescent grays. [207]  
"The ceiling keeps the time," murmured a tall bearded phantom who once sold popcorn, pointing upward with a hand part mist, part sawdust. [230]  
Marlen tilted his flashlight toward the grimy tiles overhead, noting unusual sagging near the center vent. [246]  
To verify, he began analyzing dust accumulation patterns, a trick he had learned from old maintenance manuals and from ghostly mentors. [267]  
Dust grew thickest where air seldom flowed, yet above the vent the layer was thin, combed into crescents as if something breathed there. [290]  
He unholstered his telescopic inspection mirror and slid it through the grate, heart drumming like a calliope warming up. [309]  
Reflection delivered an impossible glimpse: a polished horologist's mainspring barrel nestled among insulation, spinning softly, measuring time for no discernible clock. [330]  
Its rhythmic whirr matched the slow elevators in Marlen's dreams, those that carried memories between floors of the afterlife. [349]  
"Someone hid it up there," he whispered, aware the ghosts leaned close, faces outlined by flickers of broken neon outside. [369]  
Cracks in the facade were seldom limited to brick; they ran through timepieces, through ambitions, through souls that refused the final curtain. [391]  
Determined, Marlen dragged a step ladder beneath the vent, the aluminum legs screeching like distant trapeze wires. [408]  
Before climbing, he consulted the elevator car's ceiling panels, intuition insisting the journey upward would begin there, not on the ladder. [429]  
He pried a panel loose and found a crawl space leading over the ticket booth, a hidden arterial pathway for carnival cash decades ago. [453]  
Sliding inside, he felt the building exhale, gifting him weightlessness to balance the burden of whatever truth he would retrieve. [473]  
Crawling in near darkness, he used his phone light to follow trails left by dust-starved boards, each plank a breadcrumb. [493]  
Finally he reached the vent cavity, where the mainspring barrel sat upon a velvet clown hat, wound forever by leaking air currents. [515]  
He understood: the circus manager had cannibalized his prized watch to keep profits hidden in the ceiling, trusting the mechanism to count days until return. [540]  
But years passed, tents folded, and only ghosts remained, pacing loops while the mainspring barrel spun like a lonely spotlight. [560]  
Marlen pocketed the device delicately, intending to donate it to the town museum, where its tick could engage living ears and settle restless ones. [584]  
As he crawled back, the ghosts lined the passage, bowing with gratitude, their translucent faces relieved of a weightless burden identical to his own. [608]  
Outside the elevator, dawn pressed pale fingers against broken ticket windows, and Marlen, ever skillfully observant, noticed the facade's cracks relaxing, as though time itself exhaled. [634]  
He shut down the breaker and the fluorescent lights hummed back to life, but he left them, for his work was over when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off, not when it begins. [667]  
Driving away, he felt lighter, yet anchored by promises to ceilings everywhere, knowing each held stories waiting for a patient technician willing to listen. [691]  
Behind him, the ticket office stood silent, mainspring gone, ghosts at rest, a repaired elevator rising and falling like slow applause. [712]
