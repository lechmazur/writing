After the drawbridge rises, mist flares like a hushed blaze along the tidal moat guarding the drowned estate. [18]  
It is the appointed hour for Callum Rusk, firm shore surveyor, to begin charting what the ocean half-conceals. [36]  
He walks atop slick planks, stoically sensitive to each groan of wood, each echo of lives fled inland. [54]  
Callum carries two instruments: a brass theodolite and an antique traveling inkwell inherited from a grandmother who never traveled. [73]  
The irony stains his pocket like ink, and he smiles without showing teeth. [86]  
He intends to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams, cataloguing structures ordinary historians deem unworthy. [101]  
That singular hunger tugs him forward until he greets the submerged pavilion revealed only at the night's lowest tide. [120]  
Marble balustrades barely pierce the water, moonlight threading their cracks in patterns of interlaced absence. [135]  
The phrase once described missing relatives after a civil storm; tonight it names the geometry swallowing whole rooms beneath waves. [155]  
Callum lowers the theodolite and begins taking bearings, yet his true survey occurs inside his ribs. [171]  
Every notation he will later ink becomes a confession he cannot speak aloud. [184]  
He hops to the pavilion's mosaic floor; brine erupts through the tiles like trapped applause abruptly remembered. [201]  
From his satchel he withdraws cedar dowels, slips of waterproof paper, and a mason's mallet. [216]  
Foundation repairs, he knows, require witnesses, and he intends the witnesses to be words. [230]  
One by one, he writes terse chronicles with the antique traveling inkwell, blotting carefully despite the humid wind. [248]  
Each note cites a dream rumored to have died here: a violin recital postponed, a marriage proposal swallowed, a library unopened. [269]  
He rolls the slips, fits them into drill holes between cracked pilings, and taps dowels until saltwater seals them. [288]  
Thus he practices his method of placing notes in foundation repairs, believing future low tides will read and remember. [307]  
The hush of night ignites inside him, a quiet conflagration urging another excavation. [320]  
Under a silver arch he discovers a rusted lockbox welded to a beam by barnacles as thick as fists. [339]  
He tries picking it, but the hinge refuses; the box clings like a last thought. [354]  
Callum wrests a chisel from his belt, drives it beneath the lid, and leans with the slow patience learned from tides. [375]  
Metal groans louder than gulls; the lid yields, coughing up an interior lined with velvet and darkness. [392]  
Inside waits only a faded handbill announcing the pavilion's inaugural masquerade, never held because the sea rose too soon. [411]  
Ink at the margins has bled into design, making the masks look as though they melt. [427]  
He realizes the box, like his dowelled messages, was someone else's attempt to preserve a flame by whispering it underwater. [447]  
Interlaced absence again: generations of silence braided through fragile artifacts, each absence holding the next in place. [464]  
Callum copies the handbill's surviving words into his ledger, knowing the ink will outlive his lungs. [480]  
He tucks the original beside his own notes in a fresh cavity, sets a dowel, and kisses the wood once. [500]  
Above, chains rattle; the drawbridge has begun descending again, warning him the moat will flood back within minutes. [518]  
He gathers gear, but pauses, hearing a resonance underfoot, as if the pavilion hums approbation. [533]  
Stoically sensitive, he bows to the empty hall, accepting its voiceless thanks and granting his own. [549]  
When he steps back onto the planks, water already swirls around his boots, erasing his footprints in a soft hiss. [569]  
He feels lighter, as though the pavilion wrested a burden from him in exchange for sheltering his cargo of remembrance. [589]  
Across the moat, lanterns in the village wink out one by one, yet the mist keeps its shy illumination. [608]  
Callum thinks of the dowels settling, words soaking, timbers tightening, and imagines a chorus of distant readers breathing again. [627]  
The hush remains a blaze in his chest, guiding him toward the next forgotten structure along the storm-torn coast. [646]  
Tomorrow he will return, after the drawbridge rises once more, to resume measuring distances between longing and stone. [664]  
For now he departs, a firm shore surveyor whose footsteps echo with dreams newly un-abandoned. [679]
