Dusky harmony pooled across the sky as I climbed the marble stairs toward the echoing terrace in spring. [18]
Each footstep returned a soft chord, like a throat clearing itself before confession, announcing the arrival of the elusive mirage painter I served. [41]
He waited at the parapet, its facets still shining like a prism parapet after rain, scattering shy colors across the andesite floor. [63]
Though his face remained perceptively calm, his hands trembled with expectation, as if they carried a borrowed heartbeat not fully anchored to his chest. [87]
Around us, the city hushed, sensing how soon the cathedral bells would clamor, and every echo felt suspended over the hush before bells ring. [111]
Master Ariste, for that was the painter's chosen alias, studied the shifting lights and said my presence would grace his final mural. [133]
He had painted illusions on desert sand, on moonlit sails, even on the fleeting vapor of geysers, but never on stone that listened. [156]
Today the terrace itself would be his canvas, and he meant to awaken the rock so mirrors everywhere might learn new directions. [178]
He whispered his motivation again, not to me but to the listening stones: to persuade mirrors to show possibilities, not only reflections of what already is. [204]
For months we had traveled with a coffer of nursery scrolls, because his pigments were not made of minerals but of melodies pressed into ink. [229]
He taught me to sing them backward, forward, and inside out, threading them through coded lullabies in children's songs until every syllable glittered. [252]
Now the scrolls lay open, fluttering in the gentle wind like fledglings testing wings. [266]
Ariste asked me to stand at the northern arch and breathe steadily so my cadence might steady his own stolen pulse. [287]
He confessed the truth then: the borrowed heartbeat belonged to a child in the infirmary below, whose fading rhythm he had promised to kindle with hope. [313]
Creating the mural would complete the circuit, returning the rhythm richer than before, provided the song could be painted before the bells announced noon. [337]
I nodded, suddenly aware that my own silence was an instrument in the composition. [351]
Ariste began to move, each brushstroke synchronized with my breath, each pigment-syllable loosed into the air like a petal carried on secret currents. [374]
Colors not yet named spilled along the balustrade, coiling into forms that resembled doors opening inside of other doors. [393]
The terrace echoed the lullabies, vibrating so finely that my bones tingled, and in the ripples I saw mirrored avenues branching from the city. [417]
People strolled those impossible streets, choosing careers they had never considered, greeting friends they had not yet met, laughing in futures unrolled like ribbon. [441]
I realized the painting was already persuading mirrors to show possibilities, starting with the scrying surface of my own astonished eyes. [462]
Yet the bells still slept, and we had time so long as we remained balanced on that breathless margin of morning. [483]
Ariste's face, washed in lavender light, shifted at last from calm to wonder, and his trembling ceased as the borrowed heartbeat matched my own. [507]
We feared the mural might dissolve once the bells struck, so he anchored the final stanza by touching the stone with his bare palm. [531]
Instantly a hush deeper than any bell note settled, and the terrace felt like the pause between lightning and thunder. [551]
Then, instead of metal tongues pealing, laughter rose from the city below as children wove new games around unseen doorways now shimmering in alley walls. [576]
The cathedral clocks had forgotten their duty, or perhaps been convinced to delay, granting us the margin we required. [595]
Ariste exhaled a final chord that curled into a silver signature above the mural, and his heart settled into a rhythm entirely his own. [619]
I felt the air thicken with rain-sweet fragrance, proof that the prism parapet after rain had accepted the song and would keep it alive. [643]
Across the mural, mirrors shimmered into being, each promising a path forward, each humming with dusky harmony like the first stars of evening. [666]
We listened to those hums until they molded themselves into gentle bells, not of metal but of possibility, tolling softly without end. [688]
Somewhere below, the infirmary windows burst open, and a child's laughter rose like a kite, tethered no longer to exhaustion. [708]
The heartbeat had returned home, bearing souvenirs of luminous chances glimpsed in the terrace's painted glass. [724]
Ariste bowed, not to me or the city, but to the unseen choir of mirrors now scattered across time, their silent songs awaiting curious ears. [749]
As twilight seeped into spring, we left the echoing terrace together, our footsteps lighter, already rehearsing the next lullaby that would teach stones to dream. [774]
