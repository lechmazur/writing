Jarom was a hearing aid designer who could, by some cracked blessing, hear colors faintly. [15]  
Reds hissed like steam, blues clinked like glass, and greens pulsed as distant drums. [29]  
In these tones he sensed the impact of memories, each shade a residue of someone's forgotten moment. [46]  
Lately, though, a new study consumed him: to find the sound of trust breaking. [60]  
He believed that if he could record that shatter, he might design aids that warned hearts before betrayal. [78]  
To chase this impossible note, Jarom traveled north to the sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks. [94]  
There, pears floated like lantern grubs beneath cracked panes, and rusted hulls leaned outward as if listening. [111]  
Locals whispered that the orchard was planted above forgotten bones, nourished by promises never kept. [126]  
Jarom rented a diving bell shaped like an iron gourd and descended into the glassy ruins. [142]  
As he passed the waterline, an aurora rippled through the depths, impossible yet present, painting the orchard in trembling ribbons. [162]  
The colors sang, and he cataloged their pitches on a slate of waterproof vellum. [176]  
Yet none resembled the brittle chord he imagined for fractured trust. [187]  
Desperate, he sought the ashen forge under aurora mentioned in a salvaged captain's journal. [201]  
It was said the forge could imprint silence itself onto metal. [212]  
He reasoned that imprinting an absence might reveal the elusive sound by its very outline. [227]  
After days mapping currents, he located the forge beneath a collapsed keel glowing with cold embers. [243]  
No fire burned; instead, memories smoldered there, visible as gray sparks swirling like dust motes. [258]  
Jarom understood the process: gather what was missing, shape that void, listen to its contour. [273]  
So he wandered the wrecks in search of absences, because the forge worked only by collecting absences. [290]  
He found an empty locket still open beside twin skeletons, the vow it once enclosed long dissolved. [307]  
He took a broken compass whose needle had been ripped away after mutiny. [320]  
He gathered a child's violin missing all strings, its bridge bowed like a weeping mouth. [335]  
Each absence thrummed colder than any tone, yet he pressed them into the forge's slate molds. [351]  
While cells divide unseen within his own trembling hands, the molds heated with wordless grief. [366]  
The silence they produced rang louder than surf, and Jarom nearly tore his aids away. [381]  
Then, in that charged hush, he finally heard the brittle chime he had hunted. [395]  
It was the sound of trust breaking: a thin stem snapping beneath unexpected weight, echoing forever in bone. [413]  
He recorded it onto a coil of silver, each vibration etched like frost on glass. [428]  
But the forge demanded price, and the aurora overhead dimmed as though debts were tallied. [443]  
Colors dulled, and Jarom realized he was losing his peculiar gift of chromatic hearing. [457]  
The forge, having given a sound, now took the hues that once guided him. [471]  
He hesitated, clutching the silver coil that vibrated with betrayal, weighing legacy against wonder. [485]  
If he returned home deaf to color, could he still design devices of grace? [499]  
Yet remembered trust shatters every day, and no bell warns its victims. [511]  
He fastened the coil inside his diving suit and ascended through drifting petals of silt. [526]  
The orchard lamps blurred gray as he rose, but he kept humming the newly won tone to remember coordinates. [545]  
By the time daylight fractured the surface, he could not hear the sun's yellows nor the sky's blue chimes. [564]  
Everything was a battered marvel of gray thuds, but the coil beneath his palm rang perfect. [580]  
Back in his workshop he embedded the betrayal note into a prototype, a tiny diaphragm of graphite and hope. [599]  
He tested it on himself; the device hummed when his own heartbeat thought of past lies. [615]  
The sound bruised him, but he smiled, certain it would warn others sooner, sparing them the fracture he carried. [634]  
Outside, evening light poured color he could no longer hear, yet he felt an absence closing like a completed chord. [654]  
Somewhere far beneath, the orchard sighed, cells still dividing, memories still ripening in the drowned leaves. [670]  
And though Jarom stood poorer in senses, he finally understood that absences, too, could bloom into warning. [687]  
So he tuned his remaining world of gray tones to that paradoxical bloom, guiding every future design. [704]  
The impact of memories, once only a theory, had become the engine of his battered marvels. [720]  
And the sound of trust breaking rang on, not as despair, but as cauterized promise. [735]
