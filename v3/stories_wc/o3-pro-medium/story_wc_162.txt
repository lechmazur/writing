Low sun shards scattered across the drifting prism terrace, staining every pane with pastel kaleidoscopes that refused to settle into stable geometry. [22]  
In that fractured hush, Mira, the corn maze architect's lost child, set down her travel case and listened for footsteps that never arrived. [45]  
She had grown featherly determined, the softness of her resolve matched only by the relentless way it kept flapping toward unanswered questions. [67]  
Years ago, a gale had ripped through her father's labyrinth, scattering stalks like spilled thread, and in the panic she vanished along with the pattern. [92]  
Now she wandered from ruin to rumor, carrying his pilot logbook weather code because its cryptic symbols felt like the only language they still shared. [117]  
The terrace belonged to Arin, a scholar of necessary distances, who claimed the world had elongated itself after the butterfly effect, stretching causes until they forgot their effects. [145]  
His invitation, folded into a weather map, had promised a clue hidden in ordinary wood grain, if only she could learn to read it. [169]  
Arin emerged now, thin as reed-shadow, carrying a single chair whose varnish gleamed like trapped sunset. [185]  
Sit, he said, and intuit the pattern nobody bothers to name aloud. [197]  
Mira traced the armrest, analyzing the grain in wooden furniture the way her father once traced root systems under soil maps. [218]  
The pale rings bent inward at two points, like corridors of a maze compressed within a trunk, and between them tiny knots formed thresholds that tingled under her fingertips. [247]  
Thresholds, she whispered, recalling her hunger to discover why some thresholds feel sacred while others go unnoticed. [264]  
Arin nodded, eyes reflecting shard-light, and answered with a question: What distance must exist between two tremors so that the space becomes holy rather than empty? [290]  
Mira thought of her father's rows, each corridor measured for panic corners, each opening offered as a breath, and she realized the blueprint was a prayer disguised as agriculture. [319]  
The gale that stole her had been merely wind, yet the distance it opened between her and home had grown into a cathedral she never stopped pacing. [346]  
Arin placed the pilot logbook weather code on the chair's seat, pages fluttering as if to recite an unheard liturgy. [366]  
Numbers, symbols, and terse cloud sketches aligned with the knots she'd touched, suggesting that her father navigated sky the same way he carved corn paths, mapping reverence onto risk. [395]  
But one page was torn away, its edges charred, leaving only the title 'Necessary Distances, Field Eight' scorched into the margin. [416]  
Mira understood this missing folio hid the map out of which she had fallen, and she feared that finding it might also close the cathedral she had built inside absence. [446]  
She stood, the terrace still drifting though her balance did not, and watched prism shadows reassemble into corridors across the floor. [467]  
If a maze could be made of light, she mused, perhaps exit and entry would share the same threshold, and the sacred would be what you dared to turn through. [497]  
Arin approached, featherly determined in his own right, though the feathers seemed fashioned from shadow rather than down. [515]  
He offered her a charcoaled sliver of the missing page, saying it had drifted here years earlier, caught by the prism when the terrace first began to float. [543]  
On the fragment she read a single coordinate and a note in her father's hurried script: 'Stand apart so the wind can finish singing'. [567]  
The instruction felt less like abandonment and more like choreography, honoring the necessary distances between two dancers who make one silhouette only after the lights cut out. [594]  
Mira closed the logbook, the terrace steadied, and somewhere beyond the stained glass horizon she sensed the maze rebuilding itself not from corn, but from the echo of deliberate gaps. [624]  
She would return when the rows ripened, not to be found but to walk the sacred threshold until it no longer needed to be sacred. [649]  
Until then, she and Arin would guard the prism terrace, listening to wind stumble through weather code, refining the art of hush until fracture sounded like promise. [676]
