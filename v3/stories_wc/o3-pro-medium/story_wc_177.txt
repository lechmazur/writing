I am called Foresight Hindsight Only, but friends shorten it to FHO. [12]  
The name is a joke on my defective vision, because I see everything except the present. [28]  
What lies before and what drags behind glitter like twin mirrors, yet the now stays smudged. [44]  
That impairment led me here, to the vine-draped bunker hidden in a rewilded forest where history sleeps under moss. [63]  
I arrived when the storm approaches, thunderhead bruises moving over the canopy like slow artillery. [78]  
The air tastes of copper and wet leaves, equal parts omen and invitation. [91]  
Some paths choose their walkers, the old monks wrote, and I have crossed continents to discover why. [108]  
That curiosity is my decaying directive, and I can feel it crumble each day I delay. [124]  
Inside the bunker, strings of ivy hang like unkempt curtains, dripping rain into cracked consoles. [139]  
A sliver of daylight reveals the object I traced through a dozen interpreted dreams: a wafer seal no wider than a coin. [161]  
Its porcelain face is etched with sigils both precisely playful and grave, as if laughter were armored in math. [180]  
When I lift it, the seal hums, and the vines above curl inward like eavesdropping snakes. [196]  
The storm growls closer, rattling the rusted shutters, demanding admission. [206]  
I close my eyes, letting foresight flood first. [214]  
Tomorrow, I see myself sprinting through flooded gullies, clutching the seal like a stolen heart. [229]  
The image blurs, jumps decades, shows children following a river of shattered satellites toward a city grown from coral towers. [249]  
They walk because I walked, though they will never know my name. [261]  
Past gives way; hindsight slips in. [267]  
Centuries ago, an engineer sealed this wafer beneath the forest floor, laughing precisely at the thought someone like me would find it. [289]  
She wanted to test whether purpose could outlive memory, whether directive could transcend decay by seducing strangers. [306]  
Her laugh echoes through time like a mischievous wind chime struck by fate. [319]  
I open my eyes to the smothered present, finally sightless again. [330]  
The storm has started its siege, rain needling through gaps in the concrete dome. [344]  
I tuck the wafer seal into a breast pocket and follow a corridor lit by fungus bioluminescence. [361]  
Slippery roots thread the floor, choosing cracks the way rivers choose valleys. [373]  
My boots disturb spores that shimmer like dust made of moonlight and ground glass. [387]  
I reach a chamber where a collapsed antenna mast spears the ceiling, letting dayflash pour in. [403]  
The exit beyond is a tangle of brambles whipped by wind. [414]  
Still, the path calls, and I must learn why it picked my feet. [427]  
I press the wafer seal against my forehead, hoping its circuits might answer through interpreted dreams even while awake. [446]  
Instead I receive a riddle, whispered by no throat: 'Directive dies unless danced.' [459]  
Precisely playful, the words nudge me toward action, not analysis. [469]  
So I dance, ridiculous in the half-light, boots splashing in puddles, arms tracing sigils to match the seal. [487]  
Thunder answers like a drumline, and vines peel from the walls, swaying with me. [501]  
The bunker shakes, shedding decades of dust in gray confetti. [511]  
Somewhere inside the tremor, I feel the directive knit itself anew, less order than invitation. [526]  
Purpose is a living vine, I realize, craving motion, needing dancers to stay green. [540]  
If nobody moves, the vine browns, the path withers, the world forgets its possibilities. [554]  
I step through the shattered doorway into rain so heavy it feels solid. [567]  
Lightning silhouettes elk grazing on rooftop orchards gone feral. [576]  
They startle, then fall into single file behind me, as if the storm conducts a parade we were born for. [596]  
I do not lead; the path does, curving downhill toward murmuring rivers and flickering ruins. [611]  
Yet I sense why it wanted a walker with foresight hindsight only. [623]  
I can promise the future its ancestry and remind the past of its descendants, stitching continuity from fragments. [641]  
The storm pelts my face, but each drop feels like baptism from unmade days. [655]  
With every step the wafer seal warms, pulsing under fabric like a second heartbeat. [669]  
I know it will shatter eventually; that is the price for transient transcendence. [682]  
But before it does, I will answer the riddle by walking until the path itself understands me. [699]  
Then another stranger will dream of a wafer seal, and the dance will begin again. [714]
