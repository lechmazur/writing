<story>Mist kept the dawn shapeless over the port city. [9]  
Between cranes, a towering labyrinth of shipping containers rose like stacked dusk-coloured tombstones. [22]  
I drifted through its corridors, unnamed and mostly unseen. [31]  
People here forget quickly, especially things that never officially happened. [41]  
According to municipal files, I died last winter of accidental hemlock ingestion. [53]  
Someone signed the death certificate, stamped it, shelved it, and the city exhaled. [66]  
Yet the paper got my middle initial wrong, and clerical flaws make generous loopholes. [80]  
So I walk here, a death certificate error survivor, erasing footprints before they harden. [94]  
I filter reality differently after that near-poisoned night. [102]  
Sounds arrive first, images later, names not at all. [111]  
To keep stable, I layer what fragments I gather, like thin plies of cloth. [125]  
My motive is simple: to discover the texture of memories, even borrowed ones. [138]  
Each evening, as the tide pulls out, murmurs slide through container walls like restless ghosts. [153]  
I sit between rusted doors and collect fragments of overheard stories in a battered notebook. [168]  
Dockworkers argue about missing manifests; smugglers brag about tides; lovers trade passwords under shadows. [182]  
I capture only splinters, but together they suggest whole trees that once stood somewhere. [196]  
Whole trees mean histories, and here histories are always being erased. [207]  
The port authority deletes shipping records older than a season, claiming storage costs. [220]  
Gulls eat the discarded ledgers. [225]  
Even the wind refuses to keep a diary. [233]  
Tonight, though, I find something heavier than rumor. [241]  
A crate has burst, spilling straw and an antique apothecary trunk onto the quay. [255]  
Inside the trunk I spot a single curled label from a poison bottle, violet with age. [271]  
Arsenic Trioxide, the faded letters read, though the skull symbol has flaked away. [284]  
My throat remembers the metallic sting that almost ended me. [294]  
The label feels like a bookmark slipped back into my own erased chapter. [307]  
I pocket it, uncertain whether I am stealing or reclaiming property. [318]  
Moments later, footsteps ricochet between containers, urgent, frantic. [326]  
I duck beneath a gantry and listen. [333]  
Two men whisper about a lost inventory code and mention a ghost who steals evidence. [348]  
I realize the ghost is the bureaucratic version of me. [358]  
Their anxiety stains the air like diesel smoke. [366]  
If they discover me, they will try to correct paperwork with something sharper than ink. [381]  
The rhythm of tides clocks the minutes; waves slap steel hulls like closing file drawers. [396]  
I move with that rhythm, sliding deeper into the labyrinth as water recedes. [409]  
Every corridor looks identical, but my perception tilts, sorting hues others ignore. [421]  
I follow strands of turquoise paint someone once dripped across floor plates, a private breadcrumb trail. [437]  
The strands converge at a locked refrigerated container humming softly. [447]  
I press my ear and hear not machinery, but recorded voices repeating partial confessions. [461]  
Somebody has been layering erased histories onto magnetic tape, preserving what the city forgets. [475]  
That methodology mirrors mine, but with electricity instead of graphite. [485]  
I slip the trunk’s label beneath the door seal like a calling card. [498]  
Then I retreat as the tide turns, bringing saltwater back to rinse footprints. [511]  
Out on the quay, night cranes groan, and sodium lights sputter with moth constellations. [525]  
I open my notebook and layer tonight's gleanings over previous pages, pressing hard so words emboss. [541]  
The poison label, the taped confessions, the whispered ghost—threads braid within the paper fibers. [555]  
What pattern emerges is not yet readable, but I feel its weave under my fingertips. [570]  
Texture precedes meaning; that is the first rule of surviving an erased life. [583]  
I learned the rule when the hospital misfiled my pulse among the dead. [596]  
Now I survive by collecting pulses left unattended in ambient noise. [607]  
Every stolen memory grants a faint heartbeat to the archive I am building. [620]  
Someday, when the layers thicken enough, the archive may gain a face, maybe even a name. [636]  
Until then, identity remains optional, like signatures on forms that nobody reviews. [648]  
Across the rhythm of tides I will keep drifting, notebook open, ears tuned. [661]  
When the water lifts again, it will carry new voices against hulls, and I will listen. [677]  
Because histories do not vanish; they only wait for someone whose perception filters reality differently. [692]  
Someone already declared dead makes the ideal witness. [700]  
Under the cranes' skeletal silhouettes, I practice staying nameless so the stories can speak louder. [715]  
The poison label warms in my pocket, a quiet pulse agreeing with the plan. [729]  
Its faded ink seeps through fabric, promising that even lethal things remember their purpose. [743]  
I smile only inside, because outside I must stay an empty line on a blank form. [759]  
The tide sighs in agreement, and the labyrinth rearranges its steel walls for tomorrow’s forgetting. [774]</story>
