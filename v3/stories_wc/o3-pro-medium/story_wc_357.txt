Ryn Tal strapped himself into the pod of his windbark glider. [11]  
Above him, the orchard planet frothed with floating rock arches that bristled like petrified waves. [26]  
He breathed the whirling silence that always preceded the daily inversion of gravity. [39]  
For precisely one hour each dusk, down became up, and the planet exhaled secrets. [53]  
Ryn intended to glide that breath, navigating by water flow toward whispers older than orchards. [68]  
He was the intrepid orchard pilot, last of the Branchwarden guild, sworn to nurture skyfruit groves. [84]  
Yet tonight his oath stretched further: he sought the source of resilience that let trees bloom amid vacuum. [102]  
Every harvest had grown thinner since the cosmic blight, except one hidden quadrant rumoured to regenerate overnight. [119]  
There, growers spoke of a gathering of echoes, a place where voices fed saplings instead of insects. [136]  
Ryn believed that congregation sang with whatever force made life endure, and he meant to discover it. [153]  
A braided cord around his neck held a broken arrow tip, blackened by atmospheric entry. [168]  
He had found the shard embedded in a trunk that healed within minutes, the wound sealing green. [185]  
Tests showed the metal accelerated plant growth whenever moonlight struck the jagged edge. [198]  
The tip now pulsed faintly like a heart pacing itself for revelation. [210]  
He suspected the shard came from arrows once fired into the echo chamber to seed vitality. [226]  
Tonight he would return it, hoping the choir would answer his people's hunger. [239]  
A gong boomed below, signalling the tidal pivot; pebbles lifted around his boots like praying beetles. [255]  
Gravity inverted, and the ground fell away, leaving Ryn suspended between orchards and stars. [269]  
He kicked thrusters, angling the glider toward an upstream river that now arced overhead like liquid glass. [286]  
Navigating by water flow during inversion demanded nerve: currents exposed subterranean veins then vanished at reversion. [302]  
Ryn followed the shining ribbon, confident its spring originated near the echo nexus. [315]  
Wind whistled, but the orchards themselves uttered no leavesong, deepening the whirling silence around his cockpit. [331]  
Minutes slipped like dew; halfway through inversion he sighted the arches arranged in impossible concentric halos. [347]  
Ryn cut engines and glided, letting centripetal drift settle him onto a central monolith. [361]  
Here the air felt thick, though sensors read vacuum; echoes could be weight, he noted. [376]  
He dismounted, boots magnetizing to stone that floated miles above the illuminated orchards. [389]  
In the monolith's heart yawned a fissure pulsing with subsonic tremors, as though throats practised silent hymns. [406]  
Ryn slipped inside, guided by memory of root tunnels back home. [417]  
The passage narrowed until he crawled, following trickles of reverse-falling water that glittered like backward rain. [433]  
Suddenly the tunnel opened to a chamber where scores of broken arrow tips hovered, spinning slowly. [449]  
Their jagged edges refracted moonbeams into spirals that sounded like children breathing through hollow reeds. [464]  
Ryn realized this was the gathering of echoes, every fragment storing voices of planters long vanished. [480]  
The air trembled with layered murmurs: lullabies, pruning chants, failure confessions, newborn laughs. [493]  
Life had survived because it remembered, and memory resounded here as fertile vibration. [506]  
He drew his arrow tip, and the hovering shards turned toward him like magnetic flowers. [521]  
One by one they locked into place around his piece, mending themselves into a luminous spear. [537]  
Sudden stillness fell; even the whirling silence held its breath. [547]  
The spear pointed downward, toward the planet's core, then upward toward the orchards, as though measuring endurance. [564]  
Ryn listened, and the weapon spoke inside his marrow, a composite voice woven from generations. [579]  
"Resilience is not hidden," it sighed, "it is circulated; carry us where roots thirst." [593]  
He understood: the spear was a conduit that accelerated plant growth by pouring memory into soil. [609]  
If he replanted it among blighted groves, the stored echoes would remind seeds how to fight. [625]  
But inversion time waned; soon gravity would reclaim its throne and crush this floating sanctum. [640]  
Ryn gripped the spear, clipped its shaft to his harness, and scrambled back toward moonlit exit streams. [657]  
Water guided him, flowing upward still, a silver rope he could trust even blindfolded. [671]  
He burst onto the monolith rim just as pebbles began to settle downward again. [685]  
Engines roared; the glider dived toward orchards now looming above him like upside-down forests. [699]  
Halfway down, gravity flipped fully; he rolled, wings catching proper lift, and soared between arch shadows. [715]  
Spear light seeped through canopy gaps, sprinkling luminous letters that spelled the old hymns over leaves. [731]  
Wherever droplets touched bark, buds popped open, laughing fragrance into the bruised night. [744]  
Behind him, the arches dimmed, their purpose fulfilled, and the silence resumed its ordinary whisper. [759]  
Ahead, entire groves shimmered with newborn resilience, and Ryn Tal piloted on, hands steady, heart echoing. [775]
