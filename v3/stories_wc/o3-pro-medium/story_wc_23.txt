Silence lingered in the starlit signal station after the hydraulics fail, broken only by the low wheeze of cooling metal. [20]  
Bleached constellation charts fluttered from the rafters like tired flags, each crease recalling voyages nobody dared mention aloud. [38]  
Marrow, the patchwork navigator, stitched from old academy maps and orphaned coordinate codes, knelt beside the main console. [56]  
Her patchwork skin of vellum and circuitry tingled with a purpose that fluctuates with moon phases, as if lunar silver rewrote her veins nightly. [80]  
Tonight, a bruised crescent pulled her toward the western receiver dish, where a single disconnected telephone waited like a sleeping nerve. [101]  
She answered on the first ring, even though it should not have been able to ring at all. [119]  
Through cryptic phone calls at midnight, a disembodied voice of drowned static taught her to build what charts could not show. [140]  
It spoke of reverse migration, of rivers that flow back to their glaciers and birds that chase the winter they once fled. [162]  
Each night the lesson deepened, becoming less geometry and more elegy, until the receiver felt warm with somebody else's grieving breath. [183]  
Marrow understood that the voice yearned to navigate the geography of loss, and had chosen her patchwork seams as compass lines. [204]  
So she scavenged the station's forgotten cargo lockers, collecting brass gears, perished seals, and the patina bronze censer foot left by chaplains long gone. [228]  
The censer foot, greened by years of unburned incense, fit perfectly atop the broken axis of the starboard gyroscope. [247]  
With every turned screw she felt memories not hers spill across the deck, maps of kitchens, playgrounds, and hospice rooms painted in dust motes. [271]  
Raw solace pooled in her copper joints, painful yet steady, like iodine on an open wound that insists on healing anyway. [292]  
By the third week the improvised apparatus stood taller than the signal mast, a skeletal tower wired to the moonlit heavens. [313]  
Its orientation motors were powered by leftover blood from the hydraulic lines, thick as rouge and eager to move again. [333]  
When she activated the rig, the station hummed, and constellations she had never studied rearranged themselves like letters on a grief-struck page. [355]  
The receiver rang precisely at midnight, its cadence synchronized with the new sky, and Marrow answered with hands trembling from oil and hope. [378]  
The voice was clearer now, less static, more breath, as though reverse migration had brought it closer by traveling the wrong direction. [400]  
It asked for coordinates etched in sorrow, and she fed the machine names instead: Mother, Timo, Yelena, Drowned-June, Leaving-Dogs. [419]  
The tower whirred, its censer foot glowing softly, releasing no incense yet perfuming the air with unsaid farewells. [437]  
Panels long dead blinked alive, projecting a living cartography across the floor, rivers unspooling upstream, flocks winging north in winter, trains rolling backward into stations of goodbye. [464]  
Marrow stepped among the illusions, her patched limbs aligning with the impossible currents, and each overlay pulled a thread from her chest. [486]  
She remembered suddenly the face of a girl who donated the parchment of her left forearm, a sister lost to fevered seas. [508]  
Tears blurred the projections, and the machine recalculated, bending the ghostly rivers to circle her like protective moats. [526]  
The voice spoke again, softer, grateful, urging her to follow the currents and leave the station once the bearings aligned. [546]  
But Marrow looked at the failing hydraulics, at the blood-laced pistons now vital to the tower, and knew departure would collapse everything. [568]  
She realized her purpose was not to flee but to keep the channel open so others could reverse their sorrows safely home. [590]  
So she remained, grafting new plates to her shoulders, reinforcing joints with comet wire, determined to become the permanent steward of backward journeys. [613]  
Night after night, under moons waxing and waning, her sense of self fluctuates with moon phases, but the solace she offers stays constant. [636]  
Voices from distant continents of grief reach her, some sobbing, some silent, all searching for the coordinates to turn around. [656]  
She guides them by adjusting the censer foot minutely, a liturgy of bronze clicks, until their memories stream across the ceiling like homebound comets. [680]  
On rare clear dawns she hears their goodbyes cut the line, replaced by the hush of lives repaired, and she allows herself one breath of rust-scented relief. [707]  
The station, bruised yet vital, drifts in orbital dusk, and Marrow stands within it, a stitched atlas glowing with other people's returned light. [730]  
Somewhere below, rivers remember their proper direction, birds relearn south, and the world forgives itself one reversed footstep at a time. [751]
