Kieran stood at the radiant grotto in mist, saxophone cradled close, breathing the silver air of dawn. [17]  
The water still dripped from unseen stalactites, sounding like memories trying to remember themselves. [31]  
He exhaled a note, low and tremulous, and fog blossomed from the bell like pale lilies. [47]  
People up on the ridgeline called him the morning fog saxophonist, never just Kieran. [61]  
That suited him; names blurred when the music began. [70]  
Today, however, music was a means, not an end: he had come to silence something. [85]  
Beneath the grotto floor, rumors said, an echoing code kept foretelling fire over the river towns. [101]  
If the prophecy reached human tongues, panic would spread before sunrise dried the ground. [115]  
The council had offered soldiers, but Kieran requested only time and the prism atrium in mist. [131]  
The atrium was an abandoned glasshouse near the cave heart, panes fractured into shimmering triangles. [146]  
At first glance useless, it could refract sound the way prisms refract light, bending it inward. [162]  
Rehearsing nightly, he had found passages where vibrations disappeared, swallowed through negative space created by shattered glass. [179]  
Into that silence he meant to guide the coded prophecy and lock it there forever. [194]  
A vested hush, he called the technique: secrecy invested with purpose, tailored like a garment around absence. [211]  
The phrase tasted of velvet and rust, quietly vivid on his tongue. [223]  
He waited as dewdrops form on fern tips, listening for the prophecy's first syllable. [237]  
It began as a pulse in the stone, a heartbeat spelled in alternating intervals of hush and howl. [255]  
Stone vowels crawled up the walls, seeking throats to borrow. [265]  
Kieran stepped deeper, feet finding the glasshouse threshold where the fog thickened. [277]  
He raised the saxophone, its brass dented like an old soldier's helmet, and blew a minor chord. [294]  
The note sliced the mist, etching a corridor toward the atrium's center. [306]  
Through that corridor, the coded echo slithered, eager for listeners. [316]  
Kieran played again, each tone a scaffold over nothing, steering the prophecy by resonance alone. [331]  
The grotto answered; stalactites shimmered like tuning forks struck by invisible hammers. [343]  
He felt nostalgia press against his ribs, eerie yet comforting, as though childhood lullabies hid inside the rocks. [361]  
Once, his mother had practiced clarinet here, before the council declared the grotto haunted by futures. [377]  
Her notes still lingered, folded beneath new ones like letters tucked in attic boxes. [391]  
They, too, strained to listen as the prophecy approached the prism atrium in mist. [405]  
Kieran blew a last, long whisper, softer than paper turning in an unopened book. [419]  
The glass shards caught the sound and spun it, prismatic, until no direction remained meaningful. [434]  
Inside that radiant scramble, the echo lost its grammar and dissolved, like ink bleeding into rainwater. [450]  
A hush settled, vested now, bound by intention and glass, secure as a button sewn too tight. [467]  
The grotto exhaled, and the fog thinned, revealing motes of dawn light trembling between pillars. [482]  
Kieran lowered the saxophone, chest aching from the effort, but soul lighter than he remembered. [497]  
Outside, village roosters would soon crow, oblivious to the catastrophe that never learned their names. [512]  
He thought of telling the council, yet words felt unnecessary; absence was the truest report. [527]  
Instead he played a fragment of his mother's lullaby, gifting the grotto a keepsake for silence. [543]  
The notes rose, drifted through negative space the prophecy had vacated, and settled like new dewdrops on leaves. [561]  
He turned back toward the valley path, morning fog thinning into ribbons, saxophone case clicking shut. [577]  
Behind him, the radiant grotto in mist became just another cave, its secrets hidden in plain echo. [594]  
Somewhere above, first sun touched the ridgeline, and the world felt quietly vivid again. [608]  
Kieran smiled, the saxophone's weight at his side reminding him purpose can sound like music even when unheard. [626]  
With every step, dew burst underfoot, tiny applauses accepting the story that would never be spoken. [642]  
He breathed the cool air, carrying a final whisper of gratitude to the empty glasshouse. [657]  
Then he walked on, as dewdrops form, searching for the next unspoken future needing a vested hush. [674]
