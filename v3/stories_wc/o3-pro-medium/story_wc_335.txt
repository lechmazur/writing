I was the shard-mirror archivist, caretaker of reflections too sharp to remember themselves. [13]  
The forgotten library surrounding me creaked like an elderly hull, yet floated through memory's tides unseen. [29]  
Its aisles were lit only by an afternoon shadow caught in glass, trembling between sun and dust. [46]  
I pocketed that flicker daily, folding it like a bookmark to be reused at twilight. [61]  
Ever since the Council sentenced me to reversible exile, time itself felt provisionally stamped. [75]  
The sentence could end if the mirrors testified, but mirrors are stubborn witnesses. [88]  
So I served, annotating fracture and glimmer, hoping each note might loosen the seal. [102]  
I annotated not with ink but with questions, pricked into margins like braille for inquisitive light. [118]  
Because this archivist walks backwards when nervous, I navigated shelves in reverse, retracing courage by negation. [134]  
Colleagues had once mocked the habit, yet I found direction in retreat, a combative tenderness against despair. [151]  
It was at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze that the story truly began. [170]  
A boy no older than twelve slipped through the cracked door, eyes shining like unshelled seeds. [186]  
He said his name was Rafe and that pain had pushed him here, looking for tutoring in endurance. [204]  
I understood; exile is a syllabus on surviving edges. [213]  
I agreed to mentor resilience quietly, for thunderous lessons shatter before they settle. [226]  
First, we brewed tea in the west alcove where sunlight refracted like theory across porcelain. [241]  
I taught him resilience by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves, for angles remember what tongues forget. [258]  
We swirled the cup, mapping triangles of bitterness, crescents of hope, and improbable ellipses of delay. [274]  
Each pattern we annotated onto rice-paper scrolls that quivered like fledgling banners. [286]  
Rafe asked why the exile might ever reverse, and I gestured toward the shard mirrors locked in crates. [304]  
They contain wronged memories, I said, and memories may pardon when shown their own capacity to scar. [321]  
Our scrolls, then, were arguments written in feelings rather than facts, gently prosecuting regret. [335]  
Days passed in silent combat against despair, our tenderness drafting feints and counterstrokes in inkless script. [351]  
Yet tension thickened when footsteps echoed, forward marching unlike my nervous retreats. [363]  
Inspector Harl, envoy of the Council, arrived to audit my progress and accelerate judgment. [377]  
He carried a warrant sealed with wax the color of dried forgiveness. [389]  
Harl sneered at Rafe and called him clutter, disposable as dog-eared pages. [401]  
Combative tenderness surged; I stepped backward toward the darkest stacks, forcing him to follow uncertain footing. [417]  
Mirrors shivered inside their crates, sensing confrontation like horses smell lightning. [428]  
I warned that violence would echo across the panes, multiplying wounds infinitely. [440]  
Harl laughed, reached for a crowbar, and cracked open the largest crate. [452]  
The afternoon shadow caught in glass leapt free, suddenly weaponized into blades of dusk. [466]  
Light dimmed as though the sun had been edited out of its own sentence. [480]  
Rafe, recalling our leaf-geometry, traced a circle in the dust and stepped inside it. [494]  
Inside that improvised theorem, reflections bent, guiding the shadow toward their maker rather than their mentor. [510]  
The dusk-blades sliced Harl's warrant, not flesh, severing authority while sparing blood. [522]  
Cut symbols fluttered like dying moths, and the sentence of exile unraveled letter by letter. [537]  
The mirrors quieted, their grievances partially heard, enough for reversal to begin. [549]  
But I stayed, for libraries also need promises kept, and Rafe still studied resilience. [563]  
Exile was declared reversible; mentorship was declared necessary; both declarations inked themselves on the surviving scrolls. [579]  
I filed the torn warrant beside them, a reminder that law, like glass, can host shadows. [595]  
When dusk reddened the rafters, Rafe and I brewed a new cup, ready to read tomorrow's angles. [612]  
Outside, the playground swing finally stilled, but inside, pages and people kept learning to sway back without breaking. [630]
