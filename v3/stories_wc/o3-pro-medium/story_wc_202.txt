The rope bridges of the alchemist's market swayed above the shivering rooftops, threaded like veins between chimneys and moonlit laundry. [20]  
Lantern glass glimmered, but what caught Irida's eye was the elusively tangible shimmer of a broken lighthouse lens laid on velvet. [41]  
She was a between-worlds translator, and every translation began with an object that bent light rather than letter. [59]  
Light, she believed, held dialects no alphabet dared speak. [68]  
The merchant, a wiry woman bound in copper chains, whispered that the fragment once crowned the Faros Spire before the sea swallowed its voice. [92]  
Irida felt the tug of overlooked histories begging not to drown again. [104]  
To honor them, she offered a braid of translated myths, payment weightless yet binding. [118]  
The woman nodded and unfastened a silver clasp, releasing the lens fragment into Irida's waiting gloves. [134]  
At that touch the market fell away, replaced by an eternal instant of roaring surf, gulls, and shattered beams of dusk. [155]  
The fragment had become one of those anchors of intuition that moor a drifting mind to something truer than memory. [175]  
Voices inside the foam spoke in colors she needed to translate for souls still living. [190]  
Yet first she had to read them, and for that she required a canvas. [204]  
She returned to the swaying stalls and found Aven, a painter who hid continents in careless brushstrokes. [221]  
They had shared afternoons between childhood and now, decoding each other's silences on rooftop edges. [236]  
Irida asked him to trap the sea's lost dialect inside fresh pigment before dawn erased its echo. [253]  
Aven spread a blank panel across two crates, and the fragment became his only lamp. [268]  
Through hidden details in paintings he had always smuggled Irida's translations back to the unexpecting; tonight the stakes felt tidal. [288]  
Each stroke refracted inside the shard, and prismatic ghosts stepped onto the panel, arranging themselves like letters rearrange into confession. [308]  
Irida listened, mouth closed, heart open, letting intuition anchor again and again while she mapped sound to shade. [326]  
She murmured the translation into the night air: a promise that the lighthouse never failed, only changed address. [344]  
Below them, city streets felt the tremor; windows briefly filled with sea light, and sleepers dreamed of rescue they would later invent as deja vu. [369]  
Aven set down his brush, exhausted, yet the panel still painted itself, lines hurrying to catch a tide no clock could measure. [391]  
Irida realized the work would not finish until the fragment returned to water. [404]  
Together they climbed higher, beyond the last tarpaulin, where the bridges narrowed to cords humming against starlight. [421]  
The river glittered far below, impossible to reach in time, so Irida turned to the sky's deeper water. [439]  
She lifted the shard toward the moon; clouds parted as if some colossal librarian had unfastened a page of night to let them read. [463]  
Light poured through the lens fracture, scattering over rooftops in luminous syllables Aven could barely sketch before they faded. [482]  
In that gleam Irida saw every overlooked history she had yet to carry, queueing like travelers at dawn's border. [501]  
The weight of future errands bent her knees, but anchors of intuition held her upright, elusively tangible as breath on glass. [522]  
She thanked the fragment, pressed it to her forehead, and felt it dissolve into pure direction rather than material. [541]  
No shard remained, yet the streets below still shimmered with a knowledge no scholar could footnote. [557]  
Aven whispered that her translations were beginning to write the world forward; she replied that he was the ink that remembered. [578]  
Together they packed the still-wet panel and descended, each step a translation of altitude into promise, each promise stitched to the rooftops with faith rather than nails. [605]  
Somewhere below, a child half-asleep felt a salt breeze and knew, without knowing how, the lighthouse had moved home. [624]
