I returned to the island during the dry season, summoned by rumors of a newly revealed burial hill. [18]
Years had carried me across oceans in exile, yet my passport still listed this soil as home. [35]
I came not as a conquering son but as a diaspora returnee, uncertain how the ground would greet me. [54]
The village council promised three days of access if I helped document the dig sites. [69]
Their request offered me an excuse to linger near the root-choked hollow called the catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones. [91]
Legends claimed the orchard had once held a sundial whose shadow pointed to the kingdom of the dead. [109]
Only its cracked granite pedestal, the sundial base, still jutted from a drift of autumn leaves. [125]
I felt an immediate, cautious enchantment, as though the stones whispered while swallowing their own words. [141]
My plan was simple: chart the excavation, map each shard, and through purposeful wandering discover why my childhood prayers had withered. [162]
Below the orchard a fresh trench yawned, its edge braced with rough timber, and within it lay an archway sealed by soil. [184]
We worked across excavating a tomb that, according to pottery fragments, predated the earliest dynasties. [199]
The foreman, Taklo, swung his trowel like a metronome, measuring time with every flick of dust. [215]
At noon he paused, wiped his brow, and muttered about interrupted journeys, travelers buried before their destinies ripened. [233]
The phrase clung to me like humidity, for my own voyage home felt severed in midstride. [249]
That night I slept in an abandoned mill overlooking the orchard, listening to fruit fall like muted bells. [267]
Dreams carried me beneath the trunks, past roots twisted with ivory bones, until the sundial base glimmered like a wet moon. [288]
A voice, warmly curious yet solemn, asked whether I still believed in dawn. [301]
I woke before answering, my palms smeared with loam though I had not left the bed. [317]
At sunrise I descended to the trench and requested a solitary shift inside the unfinished corridor. [333]
Taklo agreed, distracted by a shipment of scaffolding poles, and soon the other workers hauled wheelbarrows elsewhere. [350]
Dust motes swam in lantern light while I traced the chisel marks lining the burial arch. [366]
A crack widened beneath my fingertips, releasing a breath of orchard air scented with fermenting figs. [382]
The wall surrendered, revealing a stairwell that sloped toward roots gleaming like polished antlers. [396]
Though fear pricked me, cautious enchantment urged me forward, promising that faith sometimes bloomed in darkness. [412]
I descended, counting steps, repeating the proverb my grandmother taught: 'A traveler rests only where stories wake.' [429]
The staircase ended at a cavern half orchard, half crypt, lit by shafts that filtered through fissures above. [447]
Pear trees grew in loamy mounds, their roots coiling around skulls that smirked like theatrical masks. [463]
In the center rested the sundial base, its top scarred where the gnomon once stood. [478]
Windless air seemed nonetheless to spin about it, folding hours into a single held breath. [493]
I knelt and brushed away moss, discovering a ring of etchings: ships adrift, temples aflame, people clasping empty hands. [512]
They were records of interrupted journeys, and among them I recognized a tiny figure leaving the island with a suitcase. [532]
Its return path lay unfinished, a groove uncarved. [540]
Something in that absence mirrored the hollow in my chest where belief had once camped like a bonfire. [558]
I realized the sundial had waited for someone who knew the feeling of exile to rebuild its missing arm. [577]
From my pack I drew an iron tent peg, leftover from survey equipment, and placed it in the central socket. [597]
The peg fit snugly, and a tremor rippled through the orchard, rattling branches without snapping them. [613]
Light from the fissures pivoted, casting a fresh shadow that stretched toward the stairway, pointing the way out. [631]
I followed the line, feeling as if I were walking inside a psalm rather than a tunnel. [648]
Above ground, clouds had gathered, yet a sunbeam broke through, landing precisely on the orchard's hollow. [664]
Villagers stared as the beam lingered, and Taklo crossed himself, whispering that the ancestors were guiding lost seasons home. [683]
I did not speak; wonder required silence to ferment. [692]
Yet inside I felt faith sprout like a seed that forgives the hand which buried it. [708]
My journey was no longer interrupted, merely paused, and the path ahead seemed willing to wait for my pace. [727]
I resolved to stay through the harvest, to help catalogue bones, and to listen whenever roots rustled stories upward. [746]
Perhaps, by such tending, I could rebuild the fragile bridge between earth and sky that belief calls prayer. [764]
The sundial's new arm ticked on, tracking not just hours but the slow return of trust. [780]
