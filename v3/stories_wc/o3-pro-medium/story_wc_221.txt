The corridor that led to the time dilation observation deck thrummed with machinery no longer active, its hum replaced by an echoed silence that felt alive. [26]  
I, branded the station's blessed pariah, walked alone toward the viewport that had once shown every visitor the slow ballet of distant suns. [49]  
Now the glass reflected only the dim emergency lamps, yet my task remained. [62]  
I had promised Father, during our last call before the shutdown, that the family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries would not die with him. [89]  
Tonight marked five years since the accident that left him temporally stretched in a frozen medical ward light-seconds away, waiting for time to catch him. [114]  
If I obeyed the ritual, perhaps the sketch would travel where touch could not. [128]  
I set my pad on the rail and retrieved Mother's gilded compass rose applique, its four arms still gleaming despite the station dust. [151]  
He had sewn it onto my sleeve when I first shipped out, whispering that whoever follows true north never drifts, no matter how warped the clocks. [177]  
I touched the applique to the glass, orienting it toward the void where Polaris would have gleamed if the shields were retracted. [199]  
Then I killed the last lamp. [205]  
Darkness poured over the deck like cold water, and the silence echoed again, deeper this time, as though the station exhaled. [226]  
Sensors still throbbed with latent power, so a faint panel glow offered a brief glimpse of my reflection: a lone woman haloed by floating dust. [251]  
I began to draw, letting muscle memory replace the absent sky, tracing constellations Father taught me back at the farm's broken fence. [273]  
Orion first, then the sweep of Cassiopeia, then the small uncertain cluster we had invented and named Redemption. [291]  
For each star I added a note beside it, fragments of the confusion that filled this corridor: Why stop the reactors, why cut the lines, why leave me? [319]  
But the purpose of the drawing was to turn confusion into exploration, so questions became arrows pointing outward rather than scars burrowing inward. [342]  
As graphite moved, the deck's curved bulkhead ticked, and a sliver of shield retracted with a groan. [359]  
Starlight speared the darkness, thin yet relentless, bathing the applique in silver that battled its gold. [375]  
The station's sensors must have recognized external focus and opened a viewing slit despite protocols; after the shutdown, such autonomy felt like the cosmos leaning closer. [401]  
I pressed my face to the glass and saw, with breath fogging, the real night sky, unfiltered by simulation or memory. [422]  
Light from those stars had departed centuries before the station existed, yet reached me now, laughing at human schedules. [441]  
Time itself felt stitched and temporally stretched between them and me, like molten sugar pulled into clear threads. [459]  
I oriented the compass again, aligning its crown with what instruments insisted was true north, although in orbit the concept was more faith than fact. [484]  
Father used to say that truth is a direction, not a location; you keep walking and let the world redraw behind you. [506]  
A tear escaped, floated, and struck the pad, smearing graphite into a comet tail across Redemption. [522]  
I laughed, the sound small yet resonant in the echoed silence, because comets are just wanderers with purpose mistaken for exile, much like a blessed pariah. [548]  
In that moment the deck lights flickered, and a voice crackled through a forgotten intercom, low and unsure: 'Crewmember Reyes, hold position'. [570]  
No name accompanied the command, only the hiss of static and the resonant emptiness beyond it. [586]  
I answered by lifting the pad to the starlight so any camera could read the sketch, my questions, my arrows, and the shining compass. [610]  
'Do you see them?' I asked, unsure if microphones still lived, 'Because they can guide us home if we trust the map we just made'. [635]  
The intercom clicked off, leaving me with the hum of stars and the gentle creak of metal cooling. [653]  
I resumed sketching until the page filled, then folded it into a paper ship and pressed it to the joint by the viewport where air still whispered. [680]  
If the ship slipped outward in the micro-draft, Father might receive it a century from now when ward doors opened, and perhaps he would understand. [705]  
Confusion, once frozen, had begun to thaw, and exploration took its first cautious step along the deck. [722]  
Somewhere beyond the slit, the universe waited, unbeholden to shutdowns, eager for any blessed pariah who could read a compass in the dark. [745]  
I shouldered my pack, centered true north in my mind, and walked, letting the echoed silence follow like a benign shadow. [766]
