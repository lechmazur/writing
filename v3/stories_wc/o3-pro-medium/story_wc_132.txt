Marisol Vega owned the smallest but most adored plant nursery in Barquilla, a windswept coastal town that rarely saw a calm sky. [22]  
The long storm season was gathering again, its first slate clouds gliding like cautious manta rays above her greenhouses. [41]  
She welcomed the tempests because violent weather coaxed odd behaviors from roots and leaves, an untidy encyclopedia for anyone determined to study plant behaviors. [65]  
Still, her gratitude always sounded circuitously sincere, winding through disclaimers about broken shingles before arriving at the plain truth of her obsession. [87]  
On one soaked afternoon she locked the shop sign to Closed and walked to the mossy trellis after rain that separated cultivated roses from the wild propagation beds. [115]  
Drops drummed a soft rhythm on plastic pots while wind flicked her ponytail like a metronome set too fast. [134]  
There, pinned between slats, she noticed a single linden leaf that refused to tumble despite the hurried air. [152]  
Its veins shimmered silver, as though rain had polished the hidden pathways plants keep secret from impatient eyes. [170]  
Marisol plucked it gingerly, planning to press it into her journal for later microscopic sketches. [185]  
The instant her thumb rubbed the petiole, the nursery lights flickered and her knees warmed, as if sap were replacing her blood. [207]  
She straightened, unsettled, yet curiosity overtook fear, the scholar within her scanning sensations the way a botanist names petals before smelling them. [229]  
Was this the reluctant metamorphosis her grandmother had whispered about, the one that came to caretakers who listened more than they pruned? [251]  
She had always waved that tale away like gnats, but the leaf tingled, insisting myth and root belonged to the same tangled family. [274]  
Rather than clamp down, she remembered a mantra scrawled on her clipboard, Reconstruct by releasing control. [290]  
So she inhaled the petrichor, loosened her clenched jaw, and let the storm speak through her pores. [307]  
A hush gathered, though thunder still rumbled beyond the greenhouse glass, and she sensed roots unlatching inside her feet, exploring wet earth. [329]  
Guided by instinct, she pressed the linden leaf against the trellis, and woody fibers slid from her fingertips, knitting broken lattices and rattling nails into new order. [356]  
She was reconstructing the battered support not with hammers, but with surrender, letting the texture of growth decide angles and strength. [377]  
The act felt backward, a circuit that looped through patience instead of command, yet it rang truer than any blueprint she had drawn. [400]  
When the final splinter clicked into place, the leaf browned gracefully and fell, its duty complete. [416]  
Marisol expected exhaustion, but found calm spaciousness, like a conservatory suddenly cleared of clutter. [430]  
Rain slackened to drizzle, revealing the trellis gleaming newborn green where mold patches had once sulked. [446]  
Her hands, however, were no longer entirely hers; bark filigree traced her palms, and minuscule buds peeked from knuckle folds. [466]  
Panic threatened, but the memory of how easily the structure healed reminded her that resisting would only splinter her mind. [486]  
Reluctant metamorphosis, she whispered, tasting irony, because reluctance now seemed as misplaced as an umbrella in a hurricane. [504]  
She resolved to observe the changes the way she observed seedlings, with steady notes and quiet evenings, grounding discovery in routine. [525]  
Over the next weeks of lightning and flood sirens, she charted how sunlight photosynthesized inside her lungs and how moonlight coaxed blossoms along her wrists. [550]  
Neighbors, mistaking her glow for wellness, commissioned her to revive blighted orchards, and she obliged, leaving behind footprints that sprouted clover overnight. [572]  
Each task complicated the question of identity, yet deepened her empathy for branches contorted by wind and fruit heavy with promise. [593]  
She realized her lifelong motive to study plant behaviors had always been a yearning to belong to the slow collective conversation of green things. [617]  
Now she did not merely listen; she spoke in sap, translating storm data into germination songs that orchards learned overnight. [637]  
Yet transformation is a season without calendar, and as equinox neared, she sensed a new frontier writhing under her bark skin. [658]  
To remain half human was impossible, to become full linden unimaginable, so she chose the understory where opposites braid, deciding again to reconstruct by releasing control. [684]  
She walked to the mossy trellis after rain once more, stood still, and let the storm season write whatever final blueprint it needed across her changing silhouette. [711]  
In the hush before thunder, a linden seed bobbed under the eave, waiting patiently, the first punctuation of a new chapter growing from her open palm. [737]
