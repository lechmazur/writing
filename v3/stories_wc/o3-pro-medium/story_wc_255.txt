Lio arrived at the glassblower's courtyard just after dawn smoke curled into the pale sky. [15]  
It was the hour set aside for promises made after the phoenix rises, when miracles might cool slowly beside molten art. [36]  
Lio, a colorblind painter of innocently cunning reputation, sought a miracle of his own. [50]  
He believed beauty nested inside every broken hue, and he wished to prove it to those who pitied him. [69]  
But he could not speak his deeper plans aloud, for words turned brittle in such sacred light. [86]  
Instead, he was communicating through plant arrangements, leaving silent bouquets whose shapes spelled hidden intentions. [101]  
Today he carried a basket of wilted violets, crooked thistles, and an almost fragrant weed nobody named. [118]  
Their imperfections would speak for him better than flawless roses ever could. [130]  
At the furnace mouth, Master Goran the glassblower squeezed a peculiar nozzle fashioned from a concertina reed tongue. [148]  
The instrument gave his molten gathers a trembling pulse, as though each bubble contained trapped music. [164]  
Goran noticed Lio's basket and raised an eyebrow shiny with sweat. [175]  
Lio placed the flowers on the brick ledge, stems angled in the code that asked permission to trade. [193]  
They both understood the old custom of bartered awakenings practiced after the phoenix rises. [207]  
One offered a flaw, the other offered fire, and each awoke something worth more than gold. [223]  
Goran gestured toward the annealing ovens, wordlessly agreeing to Lio's request. [234]  
Still, the master chuckled, for he thought a colorblind painter might never judge when hot glass blushed right. [252]  
Lio's innocently cunning smile answered him. [258]  
He had spent years learning to taste temperature on the air, to feel amber shading through his skin. [276]  
The flaws in his eyes had widened his other senses, the way a crack lets more music out of a bell. [297]  
Goran handed him the concertina reed tongue, inviting him to blow the next gather himself. [312]  
Lio pressed the cool metal to his lips and inhaled the furnace heat in a single trembling breath. [330]  
He exhaled through the reed, and the molten globe spun into a lopsided tear that shimmered like smoke trapped in amber. [351]  
Goran winced, seeing only imperfection, but Lio cupped the cooling glass with gloved hands as gently as a sparrow. [370]  
The uneven tear caught sunrise in unpredictable fractures, and colors he could not name flashed against his gray vision. [389]  
In that moment, he felt the piece awaken, vibrating with the promise carried by wilted violets and crooked thistles. [408]  
He set the glass beside his bouquet, completing the sentence only Goran could read: beauty hides where symmetry fails. [427]  
The master stared, the message flowering inside him, until his stern shoulders dropped like cooling slag. [443]  
He realized his perfect orbs and flawless goblets had never danced with such living light. [458]  
Quietly, he took Lio's hand and guided it back to the furnace for another gather. [473]  
This time they breathed together through the concertina reed tongue, their two pulses merging in the molten core. [491]  
The glass expanded irregularly, like a phoenix feather twisted by wind, and both men laughed without knowing why. [509]  
Goran fetched a shard from an earlier, flawless vase and dropped it into the bubble, letting imperfection seed the fusion. [529]  
Around them, apprentices paused, sensing a ritual older than the guild, older even than the annual phoenix effigy. [547]  
Bartered awakenings were unfolding before their eyes, and the courtyard felt suddenly as hushed as a chapel. [564]  
When the bubble cooled, its surface was marred by ripples, striations, and small frozen bursts where air had escaped. [583]  
Yet those wounds caught every shard of sunrise, scattering wild spectra that even Lio's muted sight could sense as warmth. [603]  
Goran bowed to the painter, humility awakening in him like a seed that splits stone. [618]  
Lio answered by rearranging the wilted bouquet, adding furnace ash for color, signing the word gratitude without speaking. [636]  
Above the chimney, the ceremonial glass phoenix effigy finally rose on its pulley, casting prismatic embers across the courtyard. [655]  
Only then did Lio allow himself to smile, knowing that after the phoenix rises, even broken eyes can find perfect dawn. [676]
