The final petal dropped from the old rosebush on the narrow iron balcony just after dusk, and Milo felt the season shift inside his chest. [25]  
He was the fire escape gardener of Pier Street, a wistfully pragmatic custodian of pots balanced over rusted railings above the luminous harbor by moonlight. [50]  
Milo whispered to the bruised horizon, and a quivering hush answered, as if the night itself held its breath for whatever he might decide. [74]  
The rose had been his beacon, crimson even in drizzle, reflecting stray streetlight into the apartment's gloom so his bedridden sister, Nara, could imagine dawn. [99]  
Now its color lay on the sill like a spent match, and he needed something new to reflect light into dark corners of her failing hope. [125]  
His neighbor, the retired lockmaster, had once entrusted him with a tiny brass shard—the bitting gauge tooth from the harbor’s decommissioned floodgate lock—and hinted at hidden luminescence below the piers. [155]  
Milo polished the curved tooth until it warmed, then slipped it into his pocket, feeling purpose instill itself within him with the rhythm of oars in water. [182]  
He left Nara a note promising safe return and began the descent of fire escapes like a cautious tide descending terraces of barnacled stone. [206]  
Between buildings, wind carried briny mist, wrapping him in protected vulnerability, as if the harbor agreed he must risk only what his heart could mend. [231]  
At dock’s end, sculled boats rocked, and the night watchman dozed; Milo untied the smallest skiff whose oars waited like patient sentences. [253]  
He rowed toward the abandoned floodgate tower, strokes measured with the rhythm of oars in water that echoed his own slow heartbeat. [275]  
Moonlight varnished the current, yet beneath its silver lay a darker seam where rumors said sunken glass chambers still breathed. [295]  
When his skiff touched the tower’s algae-slick ladder, a gull’s cry fissured the quiet, then died, leaving a quivering hush thicker than before. [318]  
Inside, gears the size of millstones slept in cobweb armor, and a single keyhole shimmered, craving the shape of the lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth. [342]  
Milo exhaled, set the tooth into the lock, and turned; metal sighed like an old captain confessing, and a panel slid away to reveal descending light. [368]  
Stairs spiraled down to a chamber whose walls were mirrored water, holding billions of captured moonbeams swirling like pale fish. [388]  
A cracked prism floated at the center, failing; with every drip from a leaking conduit, luminescence seeped out and vanished into blackness. [410]  
He understood then that the chamber had once gathered harbor light to send upwards, funneling gentleness through glass grates embedded in alley walls, the very beams that had warmed Nara’s nights. [441]  
The prism faltered because no caretaker remained, and so darkness had grown in the city’s seams like rust. [459]  
Milo, wistfully pragmatic even now, set to work, his gardener’s patience guiding his hands. [473]  
He tilted the prism, wedged shards of seashell beneath its base, and used twine from his pocket to brace the conduit, all with the rhythm of oars in water that had brought him here. [507]  
Light steadied, then amplified, coursing upward through shafts like sap returning to a winter-stripped tree. [522]  
From high vents, a soft radiance spilled across the harbor, touching pilings, gull wings, and apartment bricks, and Milo felt it reflect into every dark corner he had ever feared. [552]  
Yet the prism’s fissure widened, threatening a final shatter, and he realized it required a living steward to keep its angles true. [574]  
He thought of Nara above, waiting in fragile patience, and he pictured her face lit not by borrowed rays but by the source itself. [598]  
So he climbed back to the skiff, rowed home, and guided his sister down trembling fire escapes, the moon opening a path like a silver ramp. [624]  
Nara’s breath caught at the tower doorway, but Milo’s arm steadied her, protected vulnerability accepting its necessary risk. [642]  
Together they descended and knelt before the prism as soft waves lapped far below, the sound like distant applause. [661]  
Milo placed her trembling hands on the glass and felt something silent instill within her—calm first, then resolve—each pulse timed with the rhythm of oars in water remembered. [689]  
Light gathered through her fingers as if she were both bloom and dawn, and the prism’s crack sealed like a healed wound. [711]  
Above the city, alley grates sparked alive; rose-red, sea-green, and candle-gold rays sprayed into stairwells, attics, and orphaned shops, banishing grime that had mistaken itself for permanence. [738]  
When dawn finally came, it discovered the gardeners of the harbor not on balconies but at the heart of the floodgate, nursing a new rosebush whose first petal glowed brighter than the sun. [771]
