The fog had lain over the ruined orchard district for so long that even the apple stumps forgot sunlight. [19]  
Yet upon the shimmer of twilight frost, a thin glint sometimes escaped, like a secret lamp under blankets. [37]  
It was that glint which led Haleh, the mirror maker whose feet stayed firmly grounded even while her eyes wandered, to the district that evening. [62]  
She carried a satchel lined with velvet shards and, nestled between them, an astronomer's broken sextant she had bought for scrap. [83]  
The instrument's arc was cracked, its sighting mirror missing, yet Haleh felt the metal hum like an unfinished mouth waiting for a word. [106]  
Her own mirrors could speak, if you listened through the silver, and tonight she meant to teach the sextant the same language. [128]  
First, though, she needed to find the place where dreams habitually broke free, for she had come to capture a runaway dream rumored to haunt the orchards like a pale wasp. [159]  
Haleh stepped between rows of twisted trunks, their bark glassy with ice, and listened to the wind strike them as if the valley were filled with fragile bells. [187]  
Each note erased a boundary inside her, loosening the hinge between what was wood, what was mirror, what was sky. [207]  
She breathed in, counting four heartbeats, and the trunks inhaled with her; she breathed out, and frost steamed from their scars in synchronized breathing. [231]  
Through that rhythm she sensed the presence of the dream, skittering just beyond sight like a fish under river ice. [251]  
It was drawn to surfaces, to any chance of being reflected and therefore named. [265]  
Haleh knelt and unpacked the broken sextant, setting its dented arc toward a shard of moon that trembled above the fog. [286]  
Then she placed one of her smallest convex mirrors where the sextant's missing glass should have been, welding silver to brass with the heat of her breath. [313]  
A faint chord rang, like the first crack across a sheet of new ice, and the orchard grew still as stone. [334]  
The dream drifted toward the makeshift instrument, curious, unsure, for with the substitute mirror the sextant no longer measured stars but possibilities. [356]  
Haleh began to rotate the limb-arm, though the gear teeth were broken; instead of metal friction, she guided it through synchronized breathing, lungs pumping the mechanism like bellows of air. [386]  
With each exhale the mirror flashed, showing plum blossoms that had not bloomed for three hundred years, showing children cartwheeling through rows that were now only stumps. [413]  
Memory layered over ruin, and the boundary between now and then thinned until the fog itself looked like torn wallpaper. [433]  
The dream, seeing doorways everywhere, tried to flee into one of them, but Haleh was faster. [449]  
She angled the mirror so the dream saw its own pale outline, nothing more than a smudge of longing, and in that recognition it paused. [474]  
Using the cracked arc as a cage of light, she coaxed it to settle along the graduated scale, every notch becoming a rung of rest. [499]  
Now the sextant needed to be made whole, for only completion could keep the dream from slipping again. [517]  
Haleh set her palms against the brass and mirrored glass, closed her eyes, and matched her breathing to the pulse of the fog, to the ringing trunks, to the distant stars hidden above. [550]  
Inside that vortex of breath, boundaries collapsed entirely, and she felt both taller than the sky and small enough to nest inside an apple seed. [575]  
Through that impossible perspective, she could recreate what was broken not by replacing parts but by accepting every fracture as essential contour. [597]  
The sextant's crack sealed like ice refreezing, the mirrors aligned, and the captive dream breathed with her, no longer runaway but fellow traveler. [620]  
A resonance spread across the orchard, and the fog crystallized into glittering panes that echoed the mountains of glass some legends said ringed the world. [645]  
Haleh saw pathways among those glass mountains, clear and sharp, promising new mirrors, new songs, and she smiled because no boundary could keep her or the dream confined now. [674]  
Still, her boots pressed the frozen earth; even exalted, she remained firmly grounded, for that was the only stance from which to aim a mirror at infinity. [701]  
Gathering her tools and the now-whole sextant, she walked out of the ruined orchard district, and every footstep left a small, clear window in the fog behind her. [729]
