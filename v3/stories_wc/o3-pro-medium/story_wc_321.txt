Milo gripped the chilled railing of the Dawnlight, rehearsing today's safety speech to invisible passengers. [15]  
For weeks the vanishing commuter ferry had slipped mid-route, stranding schedules and rumors on the moonlit bay. [32]  
Yet Milo, an ardent ferry deckhand, stayed resiliently positive, polishing brass cleats that might never return. [48]  
He trusted tides the way poets trust silence: both contain promises too shy to speak first. [64]  
At six, when clocks run sideways in the harbor's uncanny fog, passengers boarded with uncertain smiles. [80]  
Milo collected tickets, noting how their faces shimmered like reflections that had slipped loose from mirrors. [96]  
The captain, Captain Rowan, handed Milo an empty hourglass found in the pilothouse after each disappearance. [112]  
'When the last grain returns, we will too,' Rowan joked, but his throat carried creaking dread. [128]  
Milo tucked the glass beside the radio, believing absence could yet be measured. [141]  
The ferry eased from the pier, engine hum aligned with gull cries like overlapping heartbeats. [156]  
Mid-channel, stars blinked out and reappeared in shuffled constellations, as though sky maps were rethreading. [171]  
Passengers gasped, but Milo saw method, a calligraphy written via interconnected patterns only patience deciphers. [186]  
He felt the ferry loosen from reality, the deck tilting not downward but sideways through itself. [202]  
Captain Rowan attempted to radio the harbor master; only snow hissed back, sounding like distant applause. [218]  
Then, with a sighing pop, the Dawnlight vanished, leaving nothing but ripples arranged in concentric spirals. [234]  
Darkness folded open, revealing a spectral grotto under starlight, its walls dripping luminous moss like slow tears. [251]  
The ferry floated inside as naturally as a breath returning to lungs. [263]  
Passengers whispered, but their voices produced visible motes, tiny lanterns that drifted upward to join rearranged constellations. [280]  
Milo recognized the shapes: ferry routes, pier numbers, even his mother's cramped handwriting on childhood lunch notes. [297]  
Everything important, it seemed, was being threaded onto one glittering string stretched beyond night. [311]  
Captain Rowan stared at Milo, eyes wide as missing moons, and asked what held them here. [327]  
Milo lifted the empty hourglass, now faintly glowing with sand that was not yet sand. [342]  
He understood: each grain represented a life caught between departures, waiting for correct alignment to settle. [358]  
His own motivation, whispered since childhood, resurfaced: to merge parallel timelines so no one missed home. [374]  
The grotto trembled, replying with a hush like distant surf moving through corridors of bone. [389]  
Milo stepped onto the bow and addressed passengers who flickered between outfits from different decades. [404]  
'We are not lost,' he said, voice steady with permanent transient resolve, 'we are being woven together.' [421]  
He turned the hourglass, and proto-sand began to fall, each grain sparking as it crossed. [436]  
With every spark, one passenger solidified, their features selecting from the flicker like a decision made. [452]  
Rowan gasped as his own reflection resolved into a younger self who had never forgotten birthdays. [468]  
Tears and laughter rippled across the deck like opposite tides agreeing to share the same moon. [484]  
Milo felt the ferry begin to reassemble in overlapping outlines, each outline a possibility now surpassing theory. [501]  
He guided the alignment not by calculation but by instinct honed from tying hundreds of cleat knots. [518]  
Knots teach you bridges between ends, he thought; timelines are only ropes with stories woven inside. [534]  
Soon the hourglass held proper sand, heavy and quiet, and the grotto doorway began closing. [549]  
Starlight poured through the narrowing seam like goodbye letters no longer needed. [561]  
With a gentle shudder, the Dawnlight reappeared beside the city pier as dawn burned pale orange. [577]  
Gulls circled, confused that nothing seemed different, while everything felt newly stitched. [589]  
Passengers disembarked in orderly wonder, carrying memories polished like fresh tickets yet unstamped. [602]  
Captain Rowan thanked Milo, but Milo merely smiled, already studying ripples for tomorrow's secret currents. [617]  
The hourglass now hung in the pilothouse, a quiet tide clock no chart could predict. [632]  
As Milo secured lines, he felt the city's morning bustle echo inside him like distant shores. [648]  
He remained resiliently positive, not from ignorance but from certainty that impermanence is another form of arrival. [665]  
After passengers left, he stroked the polished rail and whispered thanks to tides, stars, and knotted time. [682]  
Somewhere behind morning's glare, the spectral grotto awaited, and Milo's heart answered like a compass resetting. [698]  
Every journey from now on would honor the woven string, guarding the fragile miracle of merged days. [715]  
And if the Dawnlight ever vanished again, Milo would be there, ardent as sunrise, steering between possibilities. [732]
