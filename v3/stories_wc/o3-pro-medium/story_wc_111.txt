Mist hugged the garden maze at dawn, weaving through hedges like breath from something sleeping and old. [17]  
Orlan, the withered vine dresser whose back bent as severely as his pruning shears, stood at the entrance. [35]  
He was widely known as wisely pragmatic, a man who accepted rot and bloom as twin tutors. [52]  
Today he carried a velvet pouch containing his most troublesome inheritance: a collection of marbles, each cracked and clouded. [71]  
The marbles once belonged to his father, a cheerful cheat who invented mended deception as if it were a craft. [91]  
He would break trust like glass, then glue the shards together so skillfully that neighbors thanked him for the glitter. [111]  
Orlan despised that legacy, yet the cracked collection rattled inside the pouch, begging for a final trick. [128]  
Since the era when scientists installed brass gauges to count fortunate incidents, luck had become measurable, coinable, taxable. [146]  
Charts posted in taverns compared citizen averages the way farmers once compared rainfall. [159]  
Orlan's luck meter stayed stubbornly blank, recording neither gain nor loss, as if chance refused to look his way. [178]  
He suspected the garden maze whispered behind those numbers, calibrating invisible scales. [190]  
If he could prove that gardens know their gardeners, he might finally outgrow the shadow of mended deception. [208]  
So he stepped between arching yew walls, letting the pouch thump his ribs like a second heart. [225]  
The maze had been starved by drought, yet clusters of stubborn roses clung to spindly canes, blooming while withering simultaneously. [245]  
Orlan stroked a petal gone half brittle, murmuring counts of last night's dew to gauge the plant's private arithmetic. [264]  
At the center clearing sat the marble pedestal where fortune clerks once read visitors' gauges for a fee. [282]  
The booth had rotted, but the pedestal still glimmered, craving something polished. [294]  
Orlan loosened the pouch, poured the cracked marbles onto the slab, and chose one veined with silver like capillaries. [313]  
He breathed on the glass, then began to polish, circles small and deliberate, as though reducing planets to axioms. [332]  
While he worked, he spoke aloud each half-success the garden and he had shared: a saved seedling, a redirected beetle, a graft that accepted. [356]  
Commemorating small victories elaborately was his quiet rebellion against records that only tracked extremes. [370]  
With every polished breath, the marble cleared, and the pedestal brightened, as if reflecting a sunrise happening under stone. [389]  
Suddenly the garden maze shifted, hedges leaning inward, vines unknotting, passages rearranging like a lung seeking more air. [407]  
A corridor opened toward the sundial that powered the town's public luck meter, its needle twitching nervously. [424]  
Orlan followed, the remaining marbles clacking in time with his hesitant steps. [436]  
At the dial's base he saw roots, thick as wrists, gripping the bronze machinery that converted sunlight into statistics. [455]  
They pulsed with the same rhythm as the marble he had polished, suggesting a subterranean conversation he had finally tuned into. [476]  
He pressed the gleaming sphere against a root's nub, and sap seeped into the seam, sealing the old crack. [495]  
A tremor rippled outward; petals fresh and shriveled alike convulsed, scattering fragrant dust that smelled of both birth and compost. [515]  
The sundial needle spun, not to a higher fortune, but to a hitherto uncharted register simply labeled 'Gardener'. [533]  
Crowds outside the hedge gasped, their gauges dimming, then glowing, as though redistributing the surplus Orlan had unknowingly hoarded for years. [554]  
He realized the maze had measured his luck all along, storing it in roots like rain in cisterns, waiting for proof of caretaking. [577]  
By polishing what was cracked, he had mended deception into transparency, letting the garden testify on his behalf. [595]  
He bowed, not to the spectators, but to the roses now simultaneously blooming and withering, for they alone understood the exchange. [616]  
The maze gently rearranged again, closing corridors, planting new mysteries, yet leaving an uncluttered path home, as if nodding. [635]  
Orlan pocketed the remaining cracked marbles; their flaws felt less like lies now and more like promises awaiting polish. [654]  
He would commemorate each forthcoming victory just as elaborately, not for luck, but to keep conversation with the listening roots. [674]  
Behind him, the sundial settled, its needle resting not at zero, not at fortune, but exactly on the gardener's mark. [694]  
The world could now measure luck, but the garden maze had measured faith, and faith had finally answered. [712]  
Orlan walked out beneath thinning mist, spine still curved yet lighter, trailing a scent of blooming withering behind him. [731]
