Silence spread across the prismatic escondite like dyed glass surrendering to dusk. [12]  
Its many angled walls shimmered with hidden colors, yet everything felt muffled, thunderous, waiting. [26]  
I, the bored immortal named Callix, waited too. [34]  
Across eras I had outlived every spectacle except my own ennui. [45]  
That afternoon a solar storm hissed along the upper sky, rattling the planet's shields. [59]  
Its charged winds slipped through cracks in atmosphere and into this hideaway by subtle routes. [74]  
I heard the arrival as hushed thunder inside my bones. [84]  
With it came the fragment I had followed across centuries: a shard of the cursed amulet of Ulin. [102]  
Smaller than a fingernail, the piece still pulsed like a stolen heartbeat. [114]  
Legends claimed the full amulet could force farewell from reality itself, showing what waits beyond goodbye. [130]  
I needed to know; immortality feels endless only when endings are impossible. [142]  
But even fragments are dangerous, and this one had decided to rebel against the space containing it. [159]  
The scholars of Rimecall named such phenomena spatial mutiny, when objects refuse assigned coordinates. [173]  
To calm it, I had prepared coils that generated embracing magnetic fields powered by the storm's flux. [190]  
Electromagnetism is the lullaby of rebellious matter. [197]  
As I lowered the shimmering shard between the coils, the escondite's prisms bent light into kneeling shapes. [214]  
Each silhouette seemed to bow not to me but to departures yet to be born. [229]  
I whispered a question the universe had always dodged: 'What happens after goodbye?' [242]  
The shard quivered, sensing the old plea. [249]  
I am dimensionally aware, a side effect of living too long in too many wars, so I felt the room curl. [270]  
Angles bent inward, surfaces swapping distances like dancers exchanging partners. [280]  
Spatial mutiny had begun, and intrigue flowed through every photon. [290]  
Secrets negotiate best in chaos, so I listened. [298]  
Static sizzled against my skin as the magnetic fields coaxed the shard to speak in glitching images. [315]  
I saw a door made of unspoken farewells, revolving between two identical rooms neither wishing to be the past. [334]  
Beyond the threshold stretched another sort of weather: a calm where thunder finished its own echo and rested. [352]  
The vision faltered as the storm outside spiked, sending violet arcs across orbit. [365]  
Energy slammed the escondite, rattling loose a floor tile that revealed a second coil I had forgotten. [382]  
The unintended asymmetry warped the magnetic lullaby into a shriek, and the shard leapt from the grasp of geometry. [401]  
It sliced midair, leaving thin seams that bled candlelight. [410]  
Through those seams I glimpsed people I had loved dying again, waving as if the first farewell never counted. [429]  
Their smiles crashed like distant thunder yet landed soft, hushed by immeasurable distance. [442]  
I almost stepped forward, but spatial mutiny has appetites; it would fold me like paper and keep me unfinished. [461]  
Instead I tuned the coils, aligning their frequencies with the storm's magnetotail. [473]  
The fields hummed, a low thunder recommended by librarians of silence. [484]  
Gradually the seams closed, but one echo remained: a whisper declaring that goodbye is not an ending, only a coordinate. [504]  
To cross it, I would need the full amulet, mastered, not mutinous. [516]  
The shard, pacified, drifted back into my palm like cooled ember. [527]  
Its pulse matched the beat of the storm, suggesting uneasy truce. [538]  
I wrapped it in leaded silk and stored it inside my ribcage, the only prison I trusted. [555]  
The prisms of the escondite cooled, returning to ordinary radiant secrecy. [566]  
Yet everything felt rephrased, like a poem whispered through thunderclaps then recopied by candlelight. [580]  
I realized boredom was merely a refusal to intrigue oneself with the next coordinate. [594]  
I had found intrigue again, through magnetic fields and a fragment craving mutiny. [607]  
Outside, the solar storm dwindled, its thunder now a hush, as if honoring our bargain. [622]  
I left the prismatic escondite carrying silence that rumbled, planning the long hunt for the remaining shards. [639]  
Farewells awaited me somewhere out there, and I intended to cross them before boredom could return. [655]  
The universe murmured like distant thunder under snow, promising that the answer would be anything but dull. [672]  
I smiled, listening to the hush between each rumble, reading coordinates in the quiet. [686]  
And for the first time in millennia, I walked toward goodbye with genuine thirst. [700]
