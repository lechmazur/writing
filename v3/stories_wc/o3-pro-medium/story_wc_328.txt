Frost stung the iron hatch as I descended the ladder into Juniper Locke's herbalist's underground garden, and every rung hummed like a tuning fork yearning for spring. [27]
Down here, pale lamps fed photosynthetic murals of thyme and ghostly mint, but my assignment demanded focus, not reverie. [46]
I was officially Milo Edgecombe, meek supply broker, yet beneath the alias beat the pulse of a cryptid researcher working undercover, stalking rumors too fragile for daylight. [73]
Somewhere among the fern-shaded alcoves, a specimen called the Laughing Loamling supposedly nested beside forgotten spores, whispering of a harmony untamed. [94]
Juniper emerged, her cloak woven from withered lavender stems that snapped with a gravitationally playful swing whenever she turned. [113]
Her eyes carried the frostbitten hope of one who denies despair by cataloging every sprout that defies the cold. [132]
She led me past hanging roots and jars of amber sap to a workbench where a flint arrowhead gleamed like captive lightning. [154]
It was ancient, she said, but never still, for pressure changes would make it slide across wood as though dreaming of flight. [176]
I asked to examine it under the pretense of valuing barter goods, yet really I sought resonances the Loamling might trust. [197]
While Juniper adjusted irrigation mists, I slipped a recorder from my sleeve and dialed the institute's relay number on an old cordless phone dangling by the seed dryer. [225]
Static snowed through the speaker, then consolidated into the trembling confessions of previous field agents, each tape-brittle voice recounting how they felt themselves metamorphose when the creature giggled inside their chests. [256]
Listening, I understood the method: only via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone could I translate my intentions into soil-tones the Loamling perceived. [281]
But connection required a conductor, so I pressed the flint arrowhead against the receiver, letting mineral edges bleed sparks into the hum of waiting secrets. [306]
The garden lights flickered; thyme curled its leaves like ears; and Juniper froze, sensing a chorus her taxonomy lacked. [325]
A pulse traveled through the mulch, retrieving footsteps that had gone absent months ago, after the missing return changed everything in town. [347]
That return concerned my brother, Devon, who vanished chasing the same cryptid and was presumed swallowed by loneliness deeper than roots. [368]
Now the mulch vibrated with his laughter, recognizable, gravitationally playful, tugging at me like a mischievous moon yanking tides inside my ribcage. [390]
Juniper whispered that the Loamling bonds to grief until it can sculpt the pain into contagious delight, thereby safeguarding the ecosystem against despair. [413]
If Devon had been absorbed but not destroyed, perhaps I could coax him and the creature into surface truth. [432]
So I spoke into the crackling receiver, recounting every petty resentment I had nursed since childhood, offering them like seeds for winter birds. [455]
Bitterness needs soil, I said, but we choose whether it sprouts nettles or narcissus, and I would rather laugh at the thorns than bleed from them. [481]
The lights went out; in the darkness the phone grew warm, and a small silhouette rose from the mulch, aggregated from spores and cellar dust. [506]
Its head was Devon's smile, its torso a tangle of moss, yet it bowed with unchildlike solemnity before unraveling into gleams that threaded the frigid air. [532]
Those gleams spun around Juniper's seedbeds, seeding laughter among the herbs, then merged with the arrowhead, which began to chirp like a stone skylark. [556]
The cordless phone died, mission logs erased, but inside my chest I felt an answering chirp, proof that sorrow had metamorphosed into song. [579]
I realized the creature's miracle was not disappearance but transformation, turning bitterness into a cosmic joke we were in on, and the punchline tasted like thawed sunlight. [606]
Juniper exhaled relief that fogged the LEDs back to life, and we shared silence ripe with possibilities only a harmony untamed could author. [629]
Aboveground, snow still ruled, yet we carried frostbitten hope in our pockets, gravitationally playful as flint that dreams of sky. [649]
