Marella crouched at the mouth of the ancient grotto under stars, listening to the sea comb its fingers through stone. [20]  
She was the island's quietly famed tidal-pool chronicler, warmly observant of every shy anemone and splash of bioluminescent surf. [39]  
Yet tonight her notebooks lay closed, because she had come with a puzzling guest and a heavier purpose. [57]  
Beside her stood Elder Quillon, keeper of the lunar archives, whose frail hands protected a velvet box no larger than a conch. [79]  
Their lantern was out, so starlight alone revealed the peaks and hollows of his wrinkled face as he broke the silence. [100]  
Marella, he whispered, the moment between tides is a hinge between eons, and we are poised upon it. [118]  
She heard the surf recede, caught the hush, and understood he spoke of transition periods, those subtle crackles in the flow of existence. [141]  
Why summon me here, across the pause in a difficult conversation I have not yet had, she asked, heart drumming. [161]  
Because only you can feel the tide of words before they are spoken, and we must foresee which future syllable will break us. [184]  
He opened the velvet box, revealing a thumb-sized jade cicada that shimmered as though its wings remembered daylight. [202]  
According to gnomic tablets, the insect had slept through three millennia of ebb and surge, waking only when time's fabric thinned. [223]  
Quillon claimed the cicada could be coaxed into song not by direct plea but through tangential approach, the way moonlight coaxes tides sideways. [246]  
Marella recognized the principle; she too gathered truths obliquely, letting crabs scuttle first so their paths sketched unseen currents. [265]  
Kneeling, she set her palm against the grotto floor, feeling its cool grain like the roof of some submerged cathedral. [285]  
She began to hum the tides' minor key, not aiming at the cicada but at the hollows that held yesterday's foam. [306]  
The grotto amplified her note, weaving it with dripping echoes until the air seemed stitched by invisible kelp threads. [325]  
On Marella's next breath, the jade cicada vibrated, unfurling stone-green wings that cast darting shadows across Quillon's eyes. [343]  
Its song was almost silent, more felt than heard, like a memory of garden wind trapped in a shell. [362]  
The sound braided with Marella's hum and rose through the grotto mouth into the star-holed sky, where constellations seemed to rearrange. [383]  
Within that living chord, Marella felt the arriving shape of tomorrow the way one feels a tide tug before water moves. [404]  
She foresaw Quillon confronting the council at dawn, defending the island's reefs against merchants who tasted only profit in coral. [424]  
She also foresaw herself faltering, angered by their indifference, letting righteous words crash too hard and shatter possibility. [442]  
The vision wavered like moonlit water, showing a second branch in which she spoke after a deliberate pause, her tone cool as low tide. [466]  
In that variant, one councilor, moved but unwilling to show it, asked an oblique question whose answer opened funds for reef sanctuaries. [488]  
The texture of time, she realized, was not smooth but corrugated, each ridge a choice sounded just a shade differently. [508]  
Her motivation clarified like water settling after storm: to discover the texture of time was to tune one's speech to its grooves. [530]  
She broke the humming, letting silence return, and the cicada folded its wings, content that the hinge of the night had clicked. [552]  
Across the pause in their difficult conversation, she spoke first, her voice low but steady. [567]  
We will meet the council at dawn, she told Quillon, and our words will arrive like a gentle tide, not a storm surge. [590]  
He nodded, relief pooling in his eyes like phosphorescence, and closed the box around the dormant jade cicada. [608]  
Together they stepped from the ancient grotto under stars, timing their strides to the hush between waves, learning already to navigate corrugations. [630]  
Far below the cliffs, the ocean inhaled, holding breath for the next turning, and Marella felt the island do the same. [651]  
Transition periods, she thought, are nothing but cosmic hesitations, and perhaps our task is simply to listen to their uncertainty until it resolves. [674]  
The stars tilted a fraction, the way polite listeners lean forward, and the night resumed its patient discourse on becoming. [694]
