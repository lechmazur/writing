Cyril Argent wandered the perimeter of the blooming fortress at dusk, fingers smelling faintly of black powder. [17]  
He was a wandering fireworks designer, hired and dismissed by courts that feared his combustive dreams. [33]  
Tonight he had come uninvited. [38]  
Petals of night-bloom roses climbed the battlements like silent audiences awaiting surprise. [50]  
Cyril breathed their perfume and felt the gravity of hopelessness slacken by a thread. [64]  
Defiance was his tinder, playfulness his fuse. [71]  
He began to hum a childhood chant while walking the inner gardens, letting rhythm measure steps. [87]  
"Three sparks for sorrow, four sparks for flight," he intoned, voice light yet deliberate. [101]  
The chant was childish music to filter intrusive doubts from his mind. [113]  
Filtering done, he focused through ambient awareness on subtle tremors of masonry and mood around him. [129]  
The fortress stones murmured about suppressed celebrations, about a princess locked in protocol rather than iron. [145]  
Cyril smiled with serious playfulness; rules were merely slow-burning fuses begging ignition. [157]  
He reached the dry fountain where palace performers rehearsed by day. [168]  
There, forgotten beneath a stone bench, lay a fire spinner's kerosene rag knot, still damp and pungent. [185]  
He pocketed the knot as though accepting a baton passed between clandestine players. [198]  
The courtyard opened toward the western wall where tiles formed ancient patterns. [210]  
Moonlight would have silvered them, but this was the hush of a night with no stars. [226]  
Instead, lanterns caged behind colored glass cast milder hues, and the mosaics seemed half-asleep. [240]  
Cyril knelt, tracing a scarlet shard that curved like a tongue. [251]  
The shards collectively spelled a note in mosaic, though court artisans insisted it was merely floral. [267]  
Cyril read the hidden script aloud, syllables hopping like startled crickets: 'Rise when roses fall.' [282]  
He laughed softly, for the message matched his mission to defy scheduled despair. [295]  
Above, a lone guard paced, armor squeaking with each pivot, unaware of the quiet reading below. [311]  
Cyril resumed his walking chant, this time weaving the mosaic words into its rhythm. [325]  
The revised chant fluttered upward like invisible banners and seemed to snag upon the guard's thoughts. [341]  
The guard paused, gaze drifting toward the garden, curiosity diluting vigilance. [352]  
Opportunity glimmered brighter than any missing star. [359]  
From his coat Cyril produced a slim bamboo tube packed with compressed chrysanthemums of colored powder. [375]  
He tied the fire spinner's kerosene rag knot around the fuse, fashioning an improvised ignition cradle. [391]  
Breathing another verse of his chant, he twirled the knot, letting centrifugal force wring out flammable mist. [408]  
Then he struck flint, caught a lick of flame, and fed it to the spinning comet in his hand. [427]  
With playful seriousness, he whispered, 'Filter gloom, reveal bloom,' and hurled the device toward the western wall. [444]  
The tube burst in silence first, birthing a bouquet of embers that illuminated the mosaics without audible alarm. [462]  
In the sudden light, the hidden note blazed crimson, readable from the battlements. [475]  
The guard, now transfixed, shouted the words to comrades: 'Rise when roses fall!' [488]  
Other sentries repeated the phrase, not knowing its origin but feeling its buoyant rebellion fill the starless air. [506]  
Within minutes, windows opened, servants listened, and the fortress mood tilted like a ship catching wind. [522]  
Cyril slipped through corridors guided by ambient awareness of echo and hush, avoiding soldiers who argued poetry. [539]  
He arrived at the observatory where the princess mapped nonexistent stars and therefore understood absence. [554]  
She turned, her gown the color of ink diluted by dusk, and met his playful bow with grave relief. [573]  
"The walls have begun to listen," Cyril said, offering the last sparks cupped in his palms. [589]  
Outside, murmurs became chants, chants became song, and song became a promise that gravity would fail tonight. [606]  
The princess smiled, placed her hand over his, and together they scattered the cinders onto her star charts. [624]  
Each ember burned a pinhole, new constellations perforating hopeless paper so that dawnlight someday might shine through. [641]  
Down below, guards were lowering drawbridges, citizens flowing in with roses plucked free of ceremonial chains. [657]  
Petals drifted like colored snow, fulfilling the mosaic's command and marking the precise moment to rise. [673]  
Cyril heard the swell and felt lighter, as though every heart below had become a lifting charge. [690]  
Serious playfulness had done what logic refused: it inverted despair and made rebellion a festival. [705]  
He and the princess stepped onto the balcony, showered by rose snow and the cheers of a fortress in bloom. [725]  
Fireworks ripped open the starless hush at last, painting temporary galaxies to remind everyone what could be permanent. [743]  
Above the noise, Cyril kept chanting, not to control the crowd, but to keep his own hope airborne. [761]  
For a wandering fireworks designer, gravity had always been an opinion; tonight, it was officially outvoted. [777]
