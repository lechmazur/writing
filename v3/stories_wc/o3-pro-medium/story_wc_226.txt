The canyon of endless echoes breathed a forged hush as dawn fingered the rims of its towers of bone. [19]  
Vera, the defiant artist, waited on a ledge whose chalky edge crumbled toward the abyss. [34]  
She wore an innocently mischievous smile that confused the vultures circling overhead. [46]  
Below her, pale spires smoldered in morning mist, tallest among them a single monolith rumored to answer sins. [64]  
Pilgrims usually arrived murmuring prayers, but Vera was here for something rougher than piety. [78]  
She sought the price of forgiveness, and she intended to bargain with uncut truth. [92]  
Before the ritual that night, she had several hours to fracture certainty into prismatic confession. [107]  
Her method, as ever, would be through impromptu poetry sessions delivered to anyone who dared approach. [123]  
The poems were knives forged of syllables, meant to refract a single truth into many shining shards. [140]  
No authority appreciated such cutlery. [145]  
Already a Marshal of the Script had followed her tracks, determined to arrest the disturbance. [160]  
He emerged from the gulch, cloak flickering like torn pages, his boots crunching bones. [174]  
Vera saluted him with a charcoal-stained finger and began to chant in lilting meter. [188]  
Words ricocheted off the canyon walls, returned enlarged, collided again, until the air rang like hammered glass. [205]  
The Marshal raised a sigil to damp the echoes, but her verses slipped around the seal, laughing. [222]  
She spoke of a child who stole a storm to water a dying orchard, and of the orchard's gratitude. [241]  
The story twinned guilt and innocence so tightly the Marshal forgot his warrant. [254]  
In the lull, Vera descended toward the pale spire, her sandals kicking up pearl-colored grit. [269]  
Mist swirled around the monolith, hiding old carvings that smelled of salt and lightning. [283]  
She pressed her ear to the stone and heard a choir rehearsing regret in subterranean chambers. [299]  
Forgiveness, the spire whispered, costs the memory it heals. [308]  
Vera clenched her sketchbook, knowing she could not afford that currency. [319]  
She needed to remember everything, especially her failures, because failures were pigments in her palette. [334]  
Instead of praying, she unpacked colored sands and began to paint the monolith with spirals. [349]  
Each spiral was a truth skewed slightly, refracted through hue, told slant so its sting survived. [365]  
As she worked, the Marshal approached again, quieter, drawn by color like a moth to coals. [381]  
He muttered that repentance required kneeling, but Vera only offered him a pouch of crimson dust. [397]  
Curiosity overcame doctrine; he took the dust, and she invited him to spill it in midair. [413]  
Together they recited a couplet, and the dust refracted sunlight into brief stained-glass ghosts of their pasts. [430]  
The Marshal saw his boyhood mischief, stealing ink, laughing under stars; Vera saw her first mural erased by censors. [449]  
Both memories pulsed with equal innocence and bruising consequence. [458]  
The spire absorbed the colored light and hummed, almost pleased. [468]  
Vera realized the canyon did not want their repentance; it wanted their honesty in all its angles. [485]  
She turned to the Marshal and proposed an exchange: her freedom for a poem that carried his name. [503]  
If he agreed, the poem would wander the world and confess his hidden kindnesses, softening the law he served. [522]  
That was the price of forgiveness she could pay: to gift another's virtue wider wings. [537]  
He pondered, the canyon reverberating his heartbeat back at him like a drum of verdict. [552]  
Finally he nodded, innocently mischievous for the first time since taking oath. [564]  
They sat cross-legged before the spire, composing stanzas that folded law into lullaby, wrath into warning, order into question. [583]  
Each verse refracted the previous, multiplying meanings like mirrors in flame. [594]  
Night tiptoed down the bone towers, and the appointed ritual hour loomed, yet neither rose. [609]  
The ritual could proceed without them; they had forged their hush elsewhere. [621]  
When their poem ended, the spire shed its mist like a curtain, revealing myriad small mirrors where their colors had dried. [642]  
In every mirror, a different truth of them stared back, none complete, all sincere. [656]  
Vera felt lighter, not absolved but accompanied by possibilities she herself had birthed. [669]  
The Marshal tore up his warrant and scattered the scraps into an updraft that sang them away. [686]  
Before dawn, they parted, each carrying copies of the poem etched on memory like fresh scars. [702]  
The canyon echoed new lines behind them, proof that the single truth had been fractured enough to live. [720]  
Somewhere above, a vulture glided in forged hush, carrying the hush onward. [732]
