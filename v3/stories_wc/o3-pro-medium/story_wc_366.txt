The tide rolled ink-black along the breakwater when Ellis Moor cut the engine. [13]
He was the reticent lighthouse supply skipper, speaking mostly through the trims of his wake. [28]
Tonight he carried lamp oil, bread, and an uninvited dread that glimmered like static. [42]
The lighthouse stood skeletal on the cliff, its lantern room rumored to be haunted. [56]
Ellis never listened to rumors, yet he kept extra matches in his coat. [69]
As the skiff nudged the mossy ladder, the lamp overhead flickered out with a sigh. [84]
The keepers would be waiting beyond that sudden dusk, and he would climb anyway. [98]
Halfway up, his boot struck a deliberate cairn: five flat stones stacked like syllables. [112]
Ellis recognized the secret code; stone heights meant words, orientations formed tense. [124]
He had invented this way of stacking stones as messages during storm seasons. [137]
Seeing another hand use it felt like hearing his own whistle from afar. [150]
The cairn spelled simply: protect. [155]
Protect what? [157]
He pocketed the top pebble for reply and continued toward the lantern. [169]
Inside, the circular room smelled of paraffin, salt, and a faint lavender of age. [183]
Two keepers hunched over a crate, their faces strangely silver in the moonlight-swamped dark. [197]
Marla, the senior, lifted warm eyes, always warmly observant, always cataloguing small mercies. [210]
Beside her, rookie Joel clutched a green shard the size of a tear. [223]
The piece of sea glass pulsed softly, catching moons that no window admitted. [236]
Ellis felt the luminescent ache of it in his ribs. [246]
Marla said, We did not place the cairn, skipper, but we found this. [259]
Ellis accepted the shard; its glow ebbed, then shaped itself into words he recognized. [273]
"Chain letter four," he murmured, throat drying. [280]
Joel blinked, confusion draped like kelp. [286]
Ellis explained the older tradition, an anonymous letter chain passed by currents not post. [300]
Each piece of sea glass bore lines etched by sand, promising safety if forwarded. [314]
Break the chain, the ocean forgot you; keep it, and storms skirted your roof. [328]
Ellis had obediently ferried three letters during prior runs, but never inside this tower. [342]
Now the lantern room itself was recipient four, and the lamp lay dark behind. [356]
Marla whispered, We feared the dark would slip into our heads forever. [368]
Ellis understood the motivation: to bottle the feeling of safety before it escaped. [381]
He struck a match; flame buttered the walls, but the darkness behind it watched. [395]
An unlit presence pressed corners, like breath inside someone else's lungs. [406]
Protect, the cairn had demanded. [411]
Ellis set the sea glass on the brass pedestal where the Fresnel lens once revolved. [426]
He added the cairn's top pebble, then four more, arranging a reply. [438]
The stack said, Light returning, hold fast, chain unbroken. [447]
As stone kissed glass, the shard brightened, pouring verdant patterns across rusted beams. [460]
A gust circled, smelling of distant citrus, and the main lamp rekindled by itself. [474]
Spectral light climbed prisms, painting the keepers golden against their own surprise. [486]
In that shine, the haunted silence felt briefly cradled instead of hungry. [498]
Joel exhaled, the first sound that was not wind scraping iron. [509]
Marla touched the sea glass and said, It is asking for a name. [522]
Ellis, normally cautious, answered, Call it Anchor, for anchors know both falling and holding. [536]
The shard accepted, its glow settling to a modest heartbeat beside the stacked stones. [550]
Outside, waves lashed the cliff, yet the tower now felt sealed from harm. [563]
Ellis realized the anonymous chain had never been superstition but a quiet network of guardians. [578]
Reticent he might be, yet his routes threaded them together like invisible rigging. [591]
He felt the wish to speak swell, then contained it, savoring the hush he protected. [606]
After the lamp flickers out again someday, another skipper will find his cairn. [619]
They will read, Bottle safety, pour light, keep the ache gentle. [630]
And the sea will remember their names even while forgetting their voices. [642]
Ellis lowered himself to the floor, leaning against cold stone, warmed by wary peace. [656]
Outside, dawn leaked lavender, but he stayed until colors diluted the glass to gray. [670]
Only then did he descend, pockets light, heart carrying the tower's anchored hush. [683]
His skiff slipped away, leaving ripples that stacked like stones behind the hull. [696]
From the cliff mouth, the resurrected beacon braided water and sky, a greenened promise. [710]
Ellis watched until its shine shrank to a star he could pocket in memory. [724]
That was enough talking for one night, he thought, and pulled away toward open silence. [739]
