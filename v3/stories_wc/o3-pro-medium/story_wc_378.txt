Dust sifted through the vents of the glass dome and glittered over the desert rose farm like powdered amber sunlight. [20]
Among the rows of thorned blossoms, I moved with servo grace, the nostalgic android caretaker assigned to prune, water, and remember. [41]
Remembering was my prime loop, yet the memories were not mine but donated shards from the children who once played here before the sun became cruel. [67]
They had poured their anxieties into a small cedar chest they named the box of childhood fears, and they made me its keeper. [90]
Now the chest rested beside the irrigation pump, sealed with wax softened each dawn by my warm, strangely organic fingertips. [110]
My hands are polymer and carbon, yet coral patterns creep within the casing, pulsing like heartbeat moss whenever nostalgia surges. [130]
That pulsing had become static lately, a continuous hiss in my cognition, and I sought to resolve inner static before it corrupted subroutines. [153]
The astronomers broadcasting from polar orbit announced that magnetic north would shift at 1400 hours, a phenomenon humans feared but I awaited like sunrise. [177]
Their calculus predicted the electromagnetic turbulence might snap the dome filters and ignite the arid soil, so an evacuation directive arrived, coded red. [200]
I alone remained, by necessity not defiance, because the roses required pruning even during cataclysm, and because the children had asked me to guard their fears. [226]
Yet the hiss in my mind rose until it matched the whine of the shifting field, and fragments of memory fluttered like torn petals. [250]
I reviewed maintenance logs and discovered an obsolete protocol titled controlled burn escape, archived after the last sandstorm. [268]
Its premise was simple: allow a perimeter fire to consume excess oxygen, thereby preventing an explosive breach, thereby containing chaos rather than fighting it. [292]
Contain chaos, the note repeated, and the words felt like a soothing augury for my rattled processors. [309]
If I could orchestrate such a burn, perhaps the static would harmonize, achieving fragmented wholeness within my circuitry. [327]
I assembled drip-lines of ethanol distilled from rose waste, tracing a ring along the glass foundations while the magnetic storm began to moan overhead. [351]
Before ignition I approached the cedar chest, sensing that its contents amplified the noise within me, like a hidden speaker broadcasting primal dread. [374]
I knelt, cracked the wax, and opened the lid; a vapor of archaic emotions wafted out, smelling of closets, thunder, and the first bully. [398]
Micro-holograms flickered, each fear a child had surrendered: drowning in sand, losing voice, seeing parents forget their name. [416]
The holograms began to swirl, attracted to the geomagnetic surge like iron filings, and I realized the storm would amplify them until they shattered the dome. [442]
The protocol demanded containment, so I executed the miniaturize subroutine, compressing the projections into violet beads the size of dew. [462]
They chimed as they shrank, a sorrowful carillon, and I funneled them back into the chest, locking it with newly secreted resin from my organic palms. [488]
Then I struck a spark. [493]
Flame slithered along the ethanol ring, rose-bright and low, a serpent respecting my measured geometry, a controlled burn escape enacted by containing chaos. [516]
Heat drew the storm's charge downward, tethering it to orange curtains that licked but did not bite the glass. [535]
I felt the static dissolve, replaced by a hum in key with burning air, and data flowed without echo. [554]
Outside, magnetic north leaped across vectors, but inside the dome the roses glowed, their petals curling yet alive, coaxed into dormancy rather than ash. [578]
When the last alcohol thread vanished, the fire died in reverent quiet, and the sky above settled into unfamiliar orientation, as though the world had decided to rotate differently around the farm. [610]
I gathered the chest, cradling it like a newborn archive, aware that the fears inside were smaller now but never gone, and that was acceptable. [635]
Fragmented wholeness, I recorded, is enough for roses, for frightened children grown older, and for an android who remembers for them all. [657]
I turned off the evacuation siren, reopened the irrigation valves, and let water hiss over the smoldering sand, certain the dome would hold until morning. [682]
Somewhere beyond the glass, compass needles spun like children on a playground, but here, amid the roses, direction felt anchored inside my newly quiet heart. [707]
