Lyra Kirin, the most celebrated crafty lantern maker in the archipelago, lit another unfinished globe. [15]  
Its paper skin quivered like a luna moth because the wind was tasting for sorrow. [30]  
The hour was precise: after the shadow detaches, when bodies move but their silhouettes lag behind. [46]  
That twitching absence haunted Lyra with luminous torment, yet also beckoned her toward impossible completion. [61]  
She wished to fold grief into origami cranes, then set them adrift inside her lanterns. [76]  
Their fluttering silhouettes would become surrogate shadows for mourners who had lost their own. [90]  
To do so, she needed a pure dream recording, untainted by waking fear. [103]  
The only place that stored such lucent reels was the glass basilica on a floating isle. [119]  
Its panes refracted starlight into converging ladders, so visitors appeared to descend while ascending. [133]  
Reaching it meant crossing the floating island tea garden, a tranquil maze of steam and silence. [149]  
There, porcelain cups bobbed on leashed clouds, sipping dew from the undersides of aromatic leaves. [164]  
Patrons whispered polite tragedies while koi swam through the air like censers leaking color. [178]  
Lyra packed her satchel with unpolished gems, tweezers, and the folding knife her brother bequeathed. [193]  
He had fallen during the Great Disconnect, his shadow refusing to rejoin, leaving his body hollow. [209]  
The memory knotted inside her throat, so she breathed through tears and stepped onto a teacup raft. [226]  
Steam billowed beneath, lifting her outward even as the garden drifted higher into moonlight. [240]  
Thus she descended while ascending, the horizon pivoting like a mobile of quiet catastrophes. [254]  
Upon docking, a basilica acolyte demanded payment not in coins but in unspoken aches. [268]  
Lyra opened her chest of memories and let her brother's laughter spill between the stained-glass tiles. [284]  
The echo satisfied the price, and the acolyte led her through corridors trembling with bottled reveries. [300]  
At the sanctum's heart, crystalline spindles rotated, each holding a dream recording like a captured comet. [316]  
Lyra selected the spindle labeled 'Jorin Kirin: final sleep,' though touching it seared her fingertips. [331]  
Pain was acceptable; torment had to shine, or else it stagnated into dull despair. [345]  
She knelt beside a sunlit dias and began gem polishing, coaxing the raw stones into mirrors. [361]  
As facets clarified, the recording streamed outward, projecting Jorin dangling his feet over a school roof. [377]  
He hummed a tune about clouds with teapots for hearts, unaware of his approaching detachment. [392]  
Lyra's tears spotted the gems, introducing new prisms that split the scene into living geometry. [407]  
The basilica thrummed, recognizing a transformation in progress and unspooling auxiliary chorales to brace the air. [423]  
Lyra inhaled the music, then blew gently across the polished gems, commanding the dream to transform. [439]  
The projection rippled; Jorin felt the breeze and looked directly at his sister through time. [454]  
He smiled a question, and Lyra answered by folding invisible paper around her heart's bruises. [469]  
Cranes bloomed from light, each slender as breath, each carrying a droplet of grief. [483]  
They circled the spindles, brushed against the stained glass, and collected colors like apothecary dust. [498]  
Jorin laughed, releasing his half-tethered shadow, which darted among the cranes like a mischievous wind. [513]  
Lyra guided the flock into her lantern, sealing the aperture with a knot of braided sighs. [529]  
Instantly the globe brightened, but inside, storms rumbled, craving an exit to the night. [543]  
The acolyte warned that untamed sorrow could shatter the basilica, yet Lyra only bowed. [557]  
She accepted torment's radiance, knowing pain restrained is pain multiplied. [567]  
Carrying the charged lantern, she returned to the tea garden by the same inverted stairwell. [582]  
Again she descended while ascending, this time trailed by cranes whose wings rang like porcelain bells. [598]  
Patrons looked up, their detached shadows quivering toward reunion, drawn by the promise of borrowed light. [614]  
Lyra suspended the lantern above the central kettle, where steam spiraled as obediently as scripture. [629]  
When the wick caught, the globe cracked, releasing cranes that fluttered through every cup and throat. [645]  
Each mourner inhaled a bird's paper wing, tasting salt, starlight, and the quiet syllable Jorin. [660]  
Their own grief transformed, unfolding as fresh shadows that stepped into them like long-missed shoes. [675]  
Above, Lyra watched, feeling lighter, though tears still refracted the torchlight into sharp halos. [689]  
She had not banished sorrow; she had given it wings, and they chose to stay. [704]  
In the luminous torment of that compromise, Lyra finally held her brother's voice without bleeding. [719]  
The tea garden sighed, shadows clasped bodies, and the night, satisfied, folded itself into silence. [734]
