The sky above the plains turned like slow machinery, blades slicing clouds into obedient ribbons. [15]
Below, a lonely farmhouse crouched in perpetual shadow cast by a ring of giant wind turbines. [31]
Since the happiness mandate, no corner of the country was free from bright posters and forced smiles. [48]
Yet here the air felt hollow, as if laughter had been printed on cheap paper and blown away. [66]
Into this emotional void came Marrow, the blank-faced performer whose mask was simply her own skin. [82]
She traveled the provinces offering shows composed of silence, contortion, and uneasy reflection. [95]
Officials tolerated her because no rule explicitly required a grin, only the absence of open sorrow. [111]
Marrow arrived at dusk, carrying a small suitcase and a dried flower bouquet wrapped in gray linen. [128]
The farmhouse belonged to Ithica Stowe, a carpenter whose wife had died during last year's turbine construction. [145]
Ithica answered the knock, eyes red, smile carefully painted for any passing inspector. [158]
Marrow bowed without expression and stepped inside, her silence louder than greeting. [170]
Rain began tapping the tin roof, polite applause for a show that had not started. [185]
Ithica asked why she had come so far to nowhere. [195]
Marrow answered by dramatically narrating mundane tasks, each word a pebble dropped into still water. [210]
"Observe," she intoned, "the kettle's weary pilgrimage from sink to stove, steam a ghost seeking its own mouth." [228]
Her narration gave humble objects tragic histories, yet she never altered her vacant gaze. [242]
Ithica felt both mocked and comforted, uncertain if the performer was saint or swindler. [256]
That moral ambiguity clung to her like dust from distant roads. [267]
After supper she offered him the bouquet, petals brittle, colors faded to parchment. [280]
"They were once planted for promise," she said, "now they remember what promise cost." [294]
Ithica took the stems, and the farmhouse settled into a remade hush. [306]
It was not the natural quiet of emptiness but the engineered silence after machinery halts abruptly. [322]
Outside, turbine blades groaned like whales, then stilled as the grid powered down for midnight maintenance. [338]
Darkness pooled, and Marrow fetched a block of cedar from her suitcase. [350]
She sat by the hearth and began to whittle, curls of fragrant wood trailing from her knife. [367]
All the while she narrated each stroke like a desperate epic. [378]
"Here, the blade burrows, carving a corridor where sorrow may walk without stumbling," she announced. [393]
Ithica watched, heartbeat finally matching the calm tempo of her steady hands. [405]
When the shape emerged, he saw it was a small lamp carved from the solid block. [421]
No wick, no flame, yet channels inside the cedar seemed ready to funnel invisible light. [436]
She placed the lamp beside the dried flowers and spoke softly. [447]
"Your grief is heavier because the world demands you float," she said. [459]
"So let us cultivate lightness inside the weight, the way wood births flame without burning entirely." [475]
The phrase struck him harder than any mandated slogan, because it acknowledged the gravity before challenging it. [492]
Morally ambiguous or not, she had named what authorities refused to see. [504]
Thunder rolled, and emergency sirens howled from the nearest town, signaling inspectors on nocturnal patrol. [519]
Ithica panicked, knowing his recent sadness could be fined as public gloom. [531]
Marrow lifted the cedar lamp and blew across its hollow top. [542]
A pale gold shimmer, neither flame nor electricity, filled the channels and spilled gentle radiance. [557]
Light gathered in the room like dawn remembering its job. [567]
When inspectors entered, they found two citizens sitting peacefully, faces illuminated, mouths relaxed but not sorrowful. [583]
The lamp's glow projected subtle halos, and notes recorded perfect compliance with the mandate's letter. [598]
No one mentioned how the inspector's own shoulders lowered, eased by the remade hush. [612]
When the officials left, turbines restarted, wind screaming its usual anthem, but the hush remained inside. [628]
It was no longer an absence; it was space where grief could float lightly alongside memory. [644]
Marrow packed her knife, bowed again, and walked into the whirring night, face unreadable as ever. [660]
