Quiet thunder rumbled far off as Len Orrick sharpened his chisels in the shed behind the cemetery. [17]  
He was the town's most thoughtful gravestone carver, a man who listened longer than he spoke. [33]  
His silence was not emptiness but a fiercely meditative tide rolling inward and outward with each slow breath. [51]  
That evening, dusk bled violet through the cracked panes of the ancient greenhouse adjoining the graveyard. [67]  
The building once nurtured exotic orchids, now it sheltered marble slabs waiting for names. [81]  
Len moved inside, lantern in hand, because the butterflies were gathering on the roof glass like dull stars. [99]  
They had arrived with the seasonal migration, a silent storm he measured time against. [113]  
Across the butterfly migration, he told anyone who asked, the grief of a whole valley could be felt. [131]  
They thought he meant poetry; he meant stone. [139]  
Tonight he sought to discover the very shape of collective grief, to render it honest on a memorial commissioned by no one yet needed by all. [165]  
His only guide would be the spectral mentorship of Mira Calder, the long-dead artisan who once tended these orchids and sculpted epitaphs like lullabies. [189]  
Len had met her first as a child, when the scent of damp soil drew him here after school. [208]  
A whisper inside the leaves pronounced his name, and the chisels at home rang with unstruck music. [225]  
Since then Mira's translucent patience accompanied his every tap. [234]  
She would appear in whatever glass still reflected dusk, her eyes steady, her voice neither echo nor wind. [252]  
"Retrace what has been loved," she now instructed, fingertips grazing the condensation on the pane. [267]  
Len understood: to carve the collective, he must walk the paths mourners walked. [280]  
He packed a notebook, a single chisel, and the woven ribbon roll his mother once kept for floral wreaths. [299]  
The ribbon would mark each station of sorrow he intended to study. [311]  
But he did not leave at once, for the greenhouse was also the family dining room in winter. [329]  
Tonight his sister Harrah arrived with steaming soup, honoring their custom of trading favorite poems at dinner. [346]  
They sat among stone blanks, butterflies settling like commas around them. [357]  
Harrah recited a verse about rain that forgets itself before touching ground, and Len felt the line land upon him. [377]  
He answered with Dickinson's hope-feather, voice low, atmosphere a thundering calm between them. [390]  
The poems braided with the creak of glass as Mira listened, invisible yet attentive. [404]  
After dinner Len tied a strip of ribbon to the doorknob, a reminder of departure, then stepped into cooling streets. [424]  
During the following weeks he retraced every procession he could remember. [435]  
He walked behind widows through echoing churches, lingered at creek bridges where teenagers released ash like accidental prayers, and sat outside hospital exits at dawn. [460]  
Each location earned a knot of ribbon, bright crimson against fences, lampposts, pew rails. [474]  
Butterflies migrated above him the entire time, lifting south in gold currents while he mapped sorrow below. [491]  
Their wings beat like muted drums, keeping the thundering calm that framed his purpose. [505]  
One dusk, as the last monarchs vanished, Mira reappeared beside a lamp on the river path. [521]  
"Listen to the ribbon," she said, and the knots rustled though there was no wind. [536]  
He closed his eyes, fiercely meditative, and heard hundreds of voices overlap into one sustained chord. [552]  
Lament and hope braided exactly like Harrah's poems and the butterfly wings. [564]  
At that moment he understood the monument must itself be porous, inviting continuation rather than ending. [580]  
He returned to the greenhouse, now late in the season, glass dark, ribbon tails stuttering in moonlight. [597]  
Len carved through three nights while Harrah read fresh poems aloud and Mira steadied his wrist. [613]  
The finished stone resembled an unfolding wing, surfaces etched with fragments of every verse traded at dinner tables for generations. [633]  
Along its edge, Len inlaid sections of the woven ribbon roll, sealing them beneath clear resin so color fluttered eternally. [653]  
No name crowned it; instead a single line glowed, chiseled deep: 'For everything that leaves, stay.' [669]  
When the town gathered to see, a hush spread wider than the cemetery. [682]  
People recognized their own grief inside the shapes, yet felt lighter, as though butterflies had traded burdens for them. [701]  
Harrah whispered a new poem to the crowd, Mira's reflection winked in polished stone, and Len finally allowed himself to exhale. [722]  
The thundering calm rolled on, not silence, but a resonance welcoming every future sorrow to be sung and shared. [741]
