Maris Lorne stood beneath the vaulted shade of the amber pavilion in autumn, studying the way dying leaves colored the light like liquid brass. [24]  
People called her a vivid mural artist, but the colors she pursued today lived outside pigment and plaster. [42]  
Quietly driven, she carried a weathered satchel containing her grandfather's collection of old postcards, each one painted with nocturnal gardens that glimmered under moonlight. [66]  
On the reverse of every card, in his spare hand, he had written a single question: Why do flowers bloom at night? [88]  
Maris had promised herself she would reckon with that riddle before the last snow of winter melted from the city's copper gutters. [110]  
Now the ice dripped like slow clocks, and the appointed season of answers pressed close upon her. [127]  
She believed the secret lived inside Saint Celandine Cathedral, whose windows were rumored to show new stories when dawn fell silent. [148]  
At sunrise she crossed the deserted square, the hush not merely morning quiet but a dawning hush that seemed to lift sound away like mist. [173]  
Within the nave, candles guttered in their sconces, releasing an umbral tenderness that turned the stone pillars into silhouettes of sleeping giants. [195]  
Maris set the postcards on a pew and approached the rose window, whose central pane concealed hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, a secret nested like season within season. [227]  
The caretaker, Brother Ellion, observed her with eyebrows like frost-bitten twigs. [238]  
I reckon you mean to see what others avoid, he murmured, offering a brass key shaped like an aster. [257]  
She accepted, and he withdrew without another sound, as though swallowed by the hush he served. [273]  
Maris unlocked the slim lattice gate and climbed the spiral stair behind the organ, rising until the city carillons became nothing but a pulse in her sternum. [300]  
There she found a narrow chamber bathed in prisms cast through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, the very phrase her grandfather had scrawled in the margins of one postcard. [334]  
The window's inner surface bore microfiligree scenes of gardens illuminated by lunar halos, petals yawning open under stars like mouths telling quiet truths. [357]  
If she aligned her eyes with the right angle, the etchings animated, unveiling a clockwork of dew and perfume that pulsed with night-blooming vitality. [381]  
She remembered painting street walls with spray that hissed like comets, yet those murals had never breathed this softly glowing life. [402]  
The postcards lay fanned on the chamber floor, and their images seemed to converse with the luminous glass, as if paper and silica had always shared a language. [430]  
Lines of encoded scripture ran beneath the pictures, and Maris, versed in street symbolism, deciphered them not as holy text but as botanical instructions. [454]  
They spoke of pigments that awaken under specific frequencies of moonlight, triggering cells within the petals to reverse the day's closure. [475]  
Night became not absence but an ultraviolet presence, a softer sun that plants had learned to greet when predators slept. [495]  
Understanding flushed through her like paint through a loaded nozzle, and she realized her grandfather had chased the same revelation but died before winter fully lifted. [521]  
Tears welled, not of sorrow but of continuation, because across the melting of winter's last snow his curiosity had crossed into hers. [543]  
She packed the postcards, descended, and thanked Brother Ellion, who only nodded as though he, too, felt flowers opening somewhere unseen. [564]  
That night, beneath streetlamps humming like subdued stars, Maris began her grandest mural on the bricks facing the river. [583]  
She mixed phosphorescent powders according to the cathedral cipher, layering hues that slept dull under sodium light yet promised to blaze when the moon climbed. [608]  
Neighbors watched, puzzled, as she painted grey, but she smiled, feeling the dawning hush coil again though night had already fallen. [629]  
When midnight crowned the sky, the mural awakened, orchards of cobalt and amethyst blossoms flaring open, exhaling light so gentle it seemed to breed new silence. [655]  
Crowds gathered, words evaporating as petals of luminous paint unfurled; they listened to color, and color answered in tones too soft for daylight. [678]  
Maris stepped back, her heart echoing the umbral tenderness that had greeted her in the cathedral, certain now that flowers bloom at night not for secrecy but for communion. [707]  
The mural would fade with the coming dawn, yet she knew its memory would linger wherever silence layered itself like glass upon glass. [730]  
In that certainty she found peace, and within peace, the next question already sprouted, ready to climb the walls of her imagination. [752]
