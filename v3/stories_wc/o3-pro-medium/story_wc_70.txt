Orange clouds drifted above the silent city, their edges glowing like diluted honey in the calm after the twelve-hour blackout. [20]  
I climbed the switchback stairs of the lightning collection tower, boots ringing on metal still warm from yesterday's storms. [39]  
The air tasted of copper and distant rain, a flavor locals call nectar dusk because it sweetens endings as much as beginnings. [61]  
At the summit gate stood Bram, the candid toll keeper whose reputation for involuntarily truthful comments was older than the tower itself. [83]  
His brass badge, tarnished by seasons of lightning spray, read Speak Fair And Exact, an instruction he could not disobey. [103]  
I offered my pass, but he blocked the grated doorway with a steady palm, eyes reflecting the storm veins webbed through the night sky. [127]  
You are here to ask why the drones stopped humming, he stated, and I found no way to deny what I had not yet spoken. [152]  
Truth slips from me like rain off slate, he apologized, stepping aside once my purpose was confessed for both of us. [173]  
Inside the observation deck, amber coils waited to drink electricity, but the real machinery was lower, where the synthetic beehive of repair drones nested. [197]  
Those drones had failed last night, causing cascading faults that swallowed every lamp from harbor to hill. [214]  
Bram reached into his coat and produced a tiny matchbox, embossed with a monogram of a lightning bolt pierced by a question mark. [237]  
He slid it to me across the console as if handing over contraband. [250]  
Inside, instead of matches, lay a coiled slip of paper bearing a cryptic riddle: When bees fall silent, where is the thunder kept? [273]  
Bram whispered that the matchbox came from the tower's architect, who believed puzzles preserved wonder in routine maintenance. [291]  
Solve it, and you will know how to coax the swarm awake, he said, though I suspect he had already solved it himself. [314]  
His duty, however, was to collect tolls, not solutions, so the revelation had to be mine. [330]  
I descended narrow service ladders into the hive chamber, light fading to violet as dusk fermented into that gentle nectar flavor again. [352]  
Rows of spherical docking cells lined the walls like honeycomb, each containing a dormant chrome bee the size of my fist. [373]  
At the center sat a lacquer box on an iron pedestal, its surface black but for hairline streaks of gold that resembled forked lightning. [397]  
The riddle's question echoed: where is the thunder kept? [406]  
I remembered that real bees store energy as nectar, so perhaps thunder, our energy, was stored here, locked within the box. [427]  
There was no latch, only a thin seam; I touched it, and painful static jumped across my knuckles, yet the lid shrugged open an inch. [452]  
Inside burned a glass ampoule filled with bottled lightning, crackling like a captured yell. [466]  
The drones needed this spark to reboot their collective mind; without it, their algorithms drifted into hibernation, like bees waiting for spring that never arrives. [491]  
I grasped the ampoule, but alarms whined as though I had stolen a god's heartbeat. [506]  
Bram's voice crackled through an intercom: Reveal what the riddle revealed to you, or the tower will refuse the gift. [526]  
I understood; preservation of wonder required ritual, a spoken spell of truth. [538]  
Holding the ampoule aloft, I declared, The thunder is kept where silence should not be allowed, in the hope of stirring flight. [560]  
The statement was both an answer and an intention, and because it was spoken honestly, the tower accepted it as payment. [581]  
Green conduits unlocked, allowing me to slot the ampoule into a crystalline heart beneath the lacquer box, where it dissolved into plasma. [603]  
One by one the chrome bees vibrated, wings unfurling with a silver rustle that sounded like rain beginning on leaves. [623]  
They streamed from their cells through honeycomb vents, swarming upward to mend burnt cables across the city, and every streetlight flickered back to life. [647]  
In the observation deck, Bram stamped my pass without asking for coins, his smile humble yet proud, like a gardener seeing first bloom. [670]  
You have paid a greater fee, he said, and unfortunately I must admit it moves me, though feelings are not on my tariff sheet. [694]  
Outside, as darkness deepened, the revived drones scribbled ribbons of light across rooftops, preserving wonder in countless neighborhoods that had thought routine power immutable. [718]  
And in that nectar dusk I understood the architect's design: lightning could light houses, but mystery could light hearts. [737]
