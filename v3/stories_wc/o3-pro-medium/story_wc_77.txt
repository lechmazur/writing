Moonlight poured like spoiled honey over the abandoned carnival funhouse. [10]  
Its warped mirrors still shimmered with lingering luminance, refusing to darken completely. [22]  
We arrived after the resuscitation, when Eli's pulse fluttered back from absence. [34]  
He clutched an antique opera cloak clasp, crusted with dried salt and something red. [48]  
Our whispering advisor hovered near his ear, mouthing warnings no microphone could catch. [61]  
I heard only fragments: a hissed imperative to keep moving, never looking back. [74]  
We entered the funhouse through a door painted with laughing skeletons peeling like sunburn. [88]  
Inside, colored bulbs flickered sickly, as if the wires remembered carnival breath. [100]  
The light's repulsive allure pulled us deeper, promising spectacle and rot in equal measure. [114]  
Eli sought something else: he wanted to trick fear into revealing its weakness. [127]  
He believed the clasp could bait that revelation, the way blood summons sharks. [140]  
I, skeptic turned accomplice, carried the dream dictionary he had annotated with paradoxical notes. [154]  
Eli insisted every instruction must be read aloud at precise junctures inside the maze. [168]  
He called the book photographically cursed, each diagram embalming the moment it was sketched. [182]  
Repeat an image and the present congeals, he had whispered during the ambulance ride. [196]  
Now, footfalls echoing, we confronted the first mirror room, shards suspended by cobweb screws. [210]  
The advisor's voice slid between the cracks of the music, directing Eli to unbosom. [224]  
He opened his coat and confessed a childhood terror of drowning in invisible ink. [238]  
The mirrors rippled, vomiting watery letters that spiraled down hallways we had not seen. [252]  
I thumbed the dictionary and found Note Seventeen, scrawled sideways in charcoal. [264]  
It read, 'Walk where words drown; breathe where glass listens'. [274]  
Obeying, we stepped through a broken pane that behaved like liquid ice. [286]  
Behind it waited corridors smeared with carnival posters, their clowns' grins half-scraped away. [299]  
Eli's heartbeat ticked against the clasp, setting its ruby like a metronome. [311]  
The advisor murmured that rhythm was bait, and fear followed percussion before scent. [324]  
We entered a room shaped as a giant eye, retina painted in decayed glitter. [338]  
At the center hung an old photo booth, coin slot rusted shut. [350]  
The booth's curtain billowed though no wind blew, emitting a chemical flash odor. [363]  
Eli whispered the next paradoxical note, a palindrome about silver negatives breeding futures. [376]  
The booth clicked open, revealing pictures of us entering rooms we had not reached. [390]  
Our faces looked photographically cursed, blurred at the edges as if time sneered. [403]  
Eli tore them up, but each shred grew luminous, the lingering luminance crawling skinward. [417]  
He pinned every glowing fragment onto his coat with the opera cloak clasp. [430]  
The shards formed a makeshift breastplate, pulsing like a diseased star beneath fabric. [443]  
Our advisor's whisper turned jubilant, claiming the trap was almost baited. [454]  
We pressed forward into a hallway stinking of wet straw and ozone. [466]  
Floorboards flexed, revealing coffins painted with carousel horses, each lid painted with a riddle. [480]  
The dream dictionary referenced these coffins: 'They hold fear's masks; demand the naked face'. [494]  
Eli knocked three times, and the lids slid aside like reluctant lips. [506]  
A shape rose, stitched together from shadow and fluorescing dust, wearing seventy clown masks. [520]  
Each mask wept syrupy darkness that sizzled when it hit the floorboards. [532]  
This was fear itself, draped in pageantry, nourished by every shriek once uttered here. [546]  
The advisor instructed Eli to stand firm and let the breastplate shine. [558]  
When the luminance struck the creature, its masks writhed, desperate to shield tender core. [572]  
Eli spoke calmly, offering to exchange the glow for the creature's hidden name. [585]  
Fear hesitated, seduced and repelled, victim of the repulsive allure we had engineered. [598]  
Masks fell like rotten petals, leaving a raw face quivering, mouth stitched by mirrors. [612]  
It whispered its name, a palindrome matching the note about silver negatives. [624]  
Eli repeated the name, and the breastplate burst, flooding the hallway with white fire. [638]  
The creature shrank into a photographically cursed thumbnail, which the advisor pocketed wordlessly. [651]  
Suddenly the carnival lights died, the lingering luminance now sealed inside that speck. [664]  
We hurried out, guided by new darkness that felt oddly breathable. [675]  
Outside, dawn smoldered, washed gray by fatigue, yet Eli smiled, clasp absent, heart steady. [689]  
He had tricked fear into revealing its weakness: vanity before unexpected light. [701]  
The advisor dissolved into quiet wind, duty fulfilled, voice no longer needed. [713]  
We left the funhouse carcass behind, but I kept the dream dictionary close. [726]  
Its paradoxical notes still shifted when unread, hinting that fear breeds heirs. [738]  
Someday another resuscitation would bring us back, unless we learned to burn pages. [751]  
Until then, the clasp-shaped void on Eli's chest glimmered like a promise. [763]
