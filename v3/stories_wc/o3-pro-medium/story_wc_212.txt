Snowflakes whispered against the fractured glass ceiling, turning the vast hall into an icebound atrium under starlight. [17]  
Alma Reyes, the town's lone heirloom seed saver, stepped inside clutching a canvas satchel to her chest. [34]  
She had come, furiously tranquil despite the blizzard, to greet the impossible dawn she had cultivated in secret. [52]  
In the satchel a single dragon-hen egg pulsed with amber veins, humming like a hive of muted suns. [70]  
Alma rested it atop a pedestal of frost-covered marble, knowing that after the egg hatches her long vigil would truly begin. [91]  
She watched, breath clouding, until the shell cracked and peeled back like petals revealing a creature woven of embered feathers. [111]  
The hatchling blinked, and a thin spiral of wind coiled above it, forming a glowing funnel: the legendary vortex inheritance. [131]  
Old folk tales warned that whoever nurtured such a being would inherit not gold but the momentum of storms. [150]  
Alma did not crave riches; she sought to discover the texture of borrowed time, a quest seeded years ago. [169]  
Her grandmother had died whispering that minutes could be planted and hours harvested if entropy were coaxed to loosen. [188]  
Tonight Alma intended to reopen that promise by decreasing entropy itself, using the hatchling as living catalyst. [205]  
The vortex bobbed above the birdling, drawing shards of ice and stray moonbeams into a silent gyre. [222]  
Alma produced an oak acorn cap, polished smooth, the last relic her grandmother had pressed into her palm. [240]  
Within its shallow bowl glimmered specks of preserved dusk gathered from seasons that no longer existed. [256]  
She nestled the cap beside the hatchling, and the funnel narrowed, tasting the memory of forests now buried in ice. [276]  
Outside, the storm roared, yet inside the hall wild serenity reigned, a heartbeat suspended between flake and star. [294]  
The hatchling chirped and flared its wings, scattering sparks that hovered instead of falling, as though gravity had paused. [313]  
Alma felt time soften around her wrists like wet clay; seconds became malleable, waiting for her fingerprints. [330]  
She remembered the method her grandmother described in fading notebooks: knit minutes together by decreasing entropy at their seam. [349]  
So Alma exhaled slowly, shaping her breath into numbers, each digit a colder moment than the last. [366]  
The vortex echoed her cadence, spinning tighter, until even the crackle of icicles seemed elongated, drawn into spectral ribbons. [385]  
Suddenly, a fissure opened in the marble floor, revealing a tunnel lit by reversely-falling droplets of thaw. [402]  
From that tunnel rose a scent of spring gardens long extinct, the aroma of seeds that never sprouted. [420]  
Hearing the fragrance, the hatchling hopped forward, and the vortex followed like a curious lantern. [435]  
Alma descended after it, her boots crunching on hoarfrost that neither melted nor grew, time-neutral crystals. [451]  
The passage led to a chamber lined with mirrors, each reflecting different seasons of the same orchard. [468]  
In the summer pane, Alma saw her younger self laughing beneath green branches; in the winter pane, she wept over stumps. [489]  
She understood: the mirrors stored unspent moments harvested from her lineage, the yield of generations who had loved the soil. [509]  
But the panes were cracking, leaking seasons into oblivion, their colors fading as entropy gnawed the frames. [526]  
If she could patch the fractures, she might cup those minutes like seeds and replant them in tomorrow. [544]  
Alma lifted the oak acorn cap, held it to the vortex, and the funnel poured luminescent particles into the relic. [564]  
The cap swelled into a tiny sphere of orbiting rings, each ring a restored second spinning backwards to cool. [583]  
She pressed the sphere against the first cracked mirror, and the glass knitted itself, leaves unfurling within the reflection. [602]  
One by one, she healed the panes, guided by the hatchling's chirps that oscillated between thunder and lullaby. [620]  
Every repair left her older, silver threading her hair, for borrowed time demanded interest, yet she worked furiously tranquil. [639]  
At last the mirrors gleamed whole, and the chamber brightened until daybreak glimmered beneath the frozen midnight above. [657]  
The vortex inheritance now hovered still, a quiet eye of possibility, waiting for Alma to sow what she had saved. [677]  
She set the rejuvenated acorn cap into soil conjured from starlight, sealing the rite, and heard spring approach like distant hooves. [698]  
Above, snow stopped falling, the glass ceiling healed, and Alma carried the hatchling upward to greet a thaw she had grown herself. [720]  
In that icebound atrium under starlight, after the egg hatches, she finally tasted the rough, sweet texture of borrowed time. [740]  
Wild serenity settled over the ruins, and the world reopened, gentler, by decreasing entropy one seed at a time. [759]
