Broken comets whispered across the void when Janus, the cosmic janitor, began his shift. [14]  
The shooting star tracking station drifted on a slow orbit above a moonless archive world. [29]  
Janus was not merely a cleaner; he was spiritually curious, dusting darkness for forgotten meanings. [44]  
He believed leftover light tucked itself in corners the engineers never thought to sweep. [58]  
The era had no name, passing through the hush of an overlooked era historians skipped. [73]  
In that hush, silence grew dense enough to nourish a flourishing stillness at every console. [88]  
Janus moved with primal elegance, broom gliding like a low comet sweeping the metallic plains. [103]  
Yet tonight, the alarm brass gonged and saffron light flooded the corridor like molten dawn. [118]  
A fragment jar containing yellow lantern glass had cracked inside the observatory vault. [131]  
Radiance hummed through the split, painting spirals on dull bulkheads, beckoning him closer. [144]  
Protocol ordered him to seal the leak, but wonder drew him to watch first. [158]  
Gazing into the shards, he saw broken stars reflecting like shy eyes behind cracked glass. [173]  
He felt their trembling, and some tender faculty inside him began to empathize. [186]  
These were celestial offcuts, vulnerable yet burning, much like himself sweeping forgotten halls. [199]  
To understand their ache, he fetched an antique quill-laser used by astronomers to trace trajectories. [214]  
He uploaded a map, then dimmed the main lights so the lantern shards glowed clearer. [229]  
By tracing the path of falling stars projected on the dome, he followed their sorrowful arcs. [245]  
Every streak ended at a broken edge in the glass, as though destiny itself were bleeding. [261]  
Janus logged the vectors, cross-referencing them with dust he had swept from the air-filtration mesh. [276]  
The particles matched; the station had been silently scoured by the same meteor tears for decades. [292]  
Suddenly, his humble labor seemed kin to cosmic erosion, two small acts carving meaning from bleakness. [308]  
He remembered his own childhood, when fragility made him hide behind strength that was faked. [323]  
Now, under whispering comets, he wished to find strength in vulnerability instead. [335]  
That wish coalesced into a plan as the lantern glass pulsed like a golden heart. [350]  
If he could mend the shard and the sky together, both might heal. [363]  
He carried the cracked vessel to the telescopic apex where the observatory hatch opened to vacuum. [379]  
Starlight flooded his face, and the broom in his other hand twitched with charged ions. [394]  
He lifted the broom, not as a sweeper but as a conductor guiding unseen orchestras. [409]  
Then he let the yellow lantern glass catch the stellar wind, its shards aligning like petals. [425]  
The broom traced circles, drawing out lines where meteor dust once scratched hull panels. [439]  
In each circling motion he wrote silent poems urging the fragments to return to flight. [454]  
Vacuum howled beyond the field, yet inside the hatch a stillness bloomed, not barren but flourishing. [470]  
The cracks sealed themselves with thin seams of light, responding to his empathic choreography. [484]  
At last, the vessel hovered, whole and humming, eager to rejoin the cosmic rivers. [498]  
Janus released it, and it sailed outward, a newly forged starlet twinkling with repaired purpose. [513]  
He watched until it melted into night, feeling his own fissures knit in sympathetic resonance. [528]  
The console alarms quieted, replaced by a heartbeat hum that seemed to emanate from him. [543]  
Cleaning duties awaited, yet the corridor felt cathedral-wide, lit by an invisible dawn. [556]  
He realized the station itself had become a monastery orbiting mystery, and he its silent abbot. [572]  
Thereafter, he recorded each meteor’s entrance with reverence, not numbers alone but tenderness in margins. [587]  
Scientists who skimmed his logs decades later sensed a quiet music beneath the data. [601]  
They called the phenomenon an anomaly; he had called it home. [612]  
Through that home, through the hush of an overlooked era, his humble vows kept rippling. [627]  
Each ripple reminded travelers that strength is sometimes a patch of vulnerability polished to brilliance. [642]  
Janus continued sweeping, but every stroke now echoed with the flourishing stillness he had midwifed. [657]  
In dust, in starlight, in the yellow lantern glass he once repaired, he traced belonging. [672]  
And the universe, hearing the broom's soft rhythms, answered with a hush of primal elegance. [687]
