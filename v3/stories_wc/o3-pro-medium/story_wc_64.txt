Night seeped over Marrow Glen, rolling like blue velvet across the graves Milo tended with forever cheerful diligence. [18]  
Villagers called him the blithe cemetery gardener, half in affection and half in unease at his midnight whistle. [36]  
He never admitted that the whistle was an answer to voices no one else felt, uncharted echoes murmuring under the moss. [57]  
These whispers were soft, yet they pressed on him with purpose, insisting he listen beyond life's tidy curtain. [75]  
One chill dusk he unearthed a small iron box while planting lilies beside the veteran's marble. [91]  
The lid creaked open to reveal an antique sovereign case, its silver chambers still reeking of ancestral tobacco. [109]  
Inside lay no coins, only a folded scrap of tapestry, tenderly organized despite age, stitches glowing with midnight dye. [128]  
Milo felt the cemetery hush lean forward like an audience expecting its name. [141]  
He slipped the scrap into his pocket and resumed whistling, but the tune tangled on his tongue. [158]  
Something wanted to untangle instead, a melody older than memory. [168]  
That night, after the chess clock runs down, in the caretaker's lodge, Milo's world tips another quiet degree. [186]  
His opponent, old Rowan, has fallen asleep over the board, but the final tick feels like a starting gun. [205]  
Milo leaves the lodge carrying lantern, pruning shears, and the sovereign case whose hinges tingle against his palm. [223]  
He crosses the dewy rows, guided by lunar milk, toward the abandoned grain elevator locals simply call the cobalt silo under stars. [245]  
Barn owls rotate their pale heads, yet none shriek; even predators respect the velvet hush enveloping that tower. [263]  
Inside, corrugated walls drink lantern light, revealing a spiral stair and, at its summit, a room hung with archaic textiles. [283]  
It is here Milo sometimes hides from dawn, lulled by the grainy scent of forgotten harvests. [299]  
Tonight the scrap from the sovereign case vibrates, aligning itself with a tattered wall hanging whose lower border is ragged as month-old thunder. [322]  
Milo pins the scrap beside the gap, discovering the design completes a procession of faceless figures lifting spades toward an unseen horizon. [344]  
He senses the figures breathe with the same restless soil he grooms every morning. [358]  
The whispers return, a choir shaped of wind and calcium, urging him to keep working until questions show their bones. [378]  
Milo realizes the tapestry is no art piece but a map stitched in grief, and its missing threads are the voices he hears. [401]  
To follow them demands craft; to resist would drown his mind in velvet dust. [415]  
He decides his task is to discover the shape of intentions lying restless beneath every grave he waters. [433]  
But first he must untangle the loose ends of the tapestry, and the only way offered gleams within his skull. [453]  
He kneels, heart scuttling like a beetle, and begins the work by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border. [472]  
Every color he straightens releases a vision: a child burying a key, a widow adding salt to clay, a soldier smiling before dawn guns. [496]  
These lives were woven into Marrow Glen, yet intent went astray, and now they petition the gardener who never learned to fear. [518]  
Hours pass, or perhaps centuries, inside the cobalt silo while constellations drift like dim beehives outside the slats. [536]  
Velveteen gloom settles over his shoulders, soft yet deafening, reminding him that comfort can chafe when steeped in unresolved memory. [556]  
At last the border lies resewn, the map complete, and Milo reads its path leading back through the cemetery to a single yew. [579]  
He descends the stairs as dawn bleeds grey along the horizon, sovereign case tucked against his heart like a metronome. [599]  
In the graveyard the yew stands over an unmarked plot, soil so recently turned it still sighs steam. [617]  
Guided by the map, Milo lifts the spade painted on the tapestry into living form, its wooden handle manifesting in his grip. [639]  
One careful plunge reveals the antique chess king Rowan carved years ago, buried beside a crumpled letter of apology never mailed. [660]  
Rowan's snores are probably echoing in the lodge, but here his hidden regret beats loud as drumhead earth. [678]  
Milo understands: the echoes, the board's silence, the map, all conspired to bring this relic up where forgiveness could bloom. [698]  
He replaces chess king and letter inside the sovereign case, seals it, and presses it beneath Rowan's sleeping hand when sun finally crests. [721]  
Intentions now have shape, the tapestry hangs whole, and the cemetery's hush feels less like an ache and more like a lullaby. [743]  
Milo resumes his whistle, bright and sure, and the uncharted echoes reply with harmonies that promise no map will again be left unfinished. [766]
