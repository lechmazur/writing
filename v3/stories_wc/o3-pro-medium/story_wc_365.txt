In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, Kael awoke beneath the blistered ceiling of an abandoned spaceport repair bay. [18]  
His trade was rare: he was a sensory map maker, charting tastes, echoes, and textures the way others traced rivers. [38]  
Tonight a cyclical surge of spontaneity pulsed through him, the latest crest in the pattern that ruled his creativity. [57]  
He called the condition being 'cyclically spontaneous,' a blessing and a burden that arrived without warning and left abruptly. [76]  
When the cycle peaked, doors whispered open in his mind, inviting him to weave between worlds. [92]  
That invitation hummed now, as tangible as the green glass shard glowing on the cracked workbench beside him. [110]  
He had found the translucent sliver lodged in a derelict guidance console, yet it seemed older than the bay itself. [130]  
Every time he touched it, he tasted brine and ozone and heard lullabies no cradle had ever sung. [148]  
Those sensations formed coordinates on his internal atlas, pointing beyond the rusted bulkheads toward truths someone had refused to speak. [168]  
Kael's motive was simple and impossible: to discover the weight of a withheld truth, the one that silenced his sister's voice years ago. [191]  
She had vanished during a jump test, leaving only a garbled distress note that ended with the words, 'redirect the map'. [212]  
Since then, Kael had suspected the note was not a plea but an instruction, obscured by whoever sealed the investigation. [232]  
Tonight, within the dusty bay, he would obey. [240]  
He pressed the shard to his temple, and the repair bay dissolved into ribbons of smell, sound, pressure, and aftertaste. [260]  
Guided by trained synesthesia, he wove the ribbons into a tunnel that arced through parallel universes like a helix of perfume. [281]  
Each step changed the flavor of gravity beneath his boots, caramel in one reality, bitter iron in the next. [300]  
Whenever a pathway threatened to collapse, he redirected the collapse into adjacent strands, the way a sailor trims sails before a squall. [322]  
This delicate redirect allowed momentum to continue, and with each correction the shard brightened, reflecting countless bays where countless Kaels hurried onward. [344]  
Finally the tunnel burst into a silent dock populated only by drifting motes of plasma and the skeleton of a jump gate. [366]  
Here, the shard tugged him toward a suspended maintenance drone, its casing etched with the same lullaby wavelengths he had once heard. [388]  
He guided his fingers across the etching, and the drone flickered awake, projecting a hologram of his sister. [406]  
She appeared older than memory but unbroken, standing amid ripples of translucent circuitry that merged with the green of oceans. [426]  
Kael, she said, her voice a mixture of sea salt and wind chimes, I have only moments before the next cycle. [447]  
He realized the shard had not just bridged space; it had synchronized their cycles of spontaneity across universes. [465]  
Tell me the truth you carried, he pleaded, because its weight has bent every map I have ever drawn. [484]  
She breathed sorrow into data and spoke: The jump tests were never about travel; they were about harvesting sensory cartographers like you. [506]  
Our employers learned that minds capable of weaving between worlds could stitch realities into weapons, and they wanted a fleet. [526]  
I redirected my test ship into a dead loop to keep them from following, but the recoil scattered me through possibilities. [547]  
If you carry this shard, you inherit my exile and my guardianship of the gate they still hunger to open. [567]  
Kael tasted the gravity of her confession, heavier than lead, yet edged with a sweetness that tasted like freedom. [586]  
He understood now that the withheld truth was not simply information but a burden intended to anchor reckless wanderers like himself. [607]  
The hologram flickered, and she said, Redirect your cycle toward concealment, not discovery, or the fleet will triangulate our resonance. [627]  
Kael weighed obedience against curiosity, then remembered that maps were never neutral; they either protect or betray. [644]  
He lifted the shard toward the skeletal gate, and with a thought he redirected every open strand back into the repair bay. [666]  
Worlds recoiled like taut cords released, snapping closed behind him until only the familiar stink of grease and dust remained. [686]  
The bay was silent, but the latent melody in the walls confirmed that every gate now slept under layers of scrambled coordinates. [708]  
Kael exhaled, sensing the next cycle already coiling in his chest, promising spontaneous urges he would have to tame. [727]  
He pocketed the green glass shard, resolved to map not roads but lacunae, the safe blanks where tyrants lose direction. [747]  
Outside, dawn crept across the landing strips, but inside he remained half-asleep, working in the murmur of half-remembered dreams once more. [768]
