The shuttle platforms once echoed with departures, but now only dust scuttled across the floor grids. [16]  
It was exactly the sort of silence that fascinated Milo Greaves, the curious civil engineer intern assigned to post-carnival cleanup duty. [37]  
The carnival had packed its gaudy rides onto trucks at dawn, leaving the abandoned spaceport passenger terminal to him and the pigeons. [59]  
Milo walked beneath faded holographic timetables, their dead projectors still listing flights to moons whose names had already slipped from common memory. [81]  
He carried a battered survey tablet, a coil of flexible conduit, and a functionally creative mind that questioned every pipe elbow and gutter seam. [105]  
The municipal engineering office expected a simple inspection, but Milo nursed a private goal: to puzzle out new equations for hope. [126]  
Hope, he believed, was just another resource stream, capable of being resurrected through redirected flows once you mapped the hidden channels. [147]  
The interior concourse still smelled faintly of popcorn and ion thruster oil, a bouquet that filled him with stoic wonder instead of melancholy. [170]  
He examined ceiling vents where carnival electricians had jury-rigged power, noting how the hasty cabling formed a sketch of branching rivers. [191]  
Water, he mused, could follow similar detours if persuaded gently enough. [202]  
A metallic glint beside a ticket kiosk interrupted his thoughts. [212]  
Half buried in confetti lay an explorer's sextant piece, its brass arc broken yet still etched with microdegree markings. [231]  
Milo pocketed it instinctively, sensing that discarded instruments sometimes aimed at truths no satellite ever saw. [247]  
He resumed his survey, tracing greywater lines that snaked beneath seating tiers, and found them clogged with melted cotton-candy syrup. [267]  
The blockage redirected runoff to an overflow culvert that dumped straight into the surrounding salt flats. [283]  
An idea unfurled like a solar sail. [290]  
If he rerouted that water through the terminal's dormant hydroponic atrium, he could resurrect not just plants but public imagination. [310]  
Yet the piping network was a maze of intentions assembled over decades by contractors, janitors, festival vendors, and now himself. [330]  
He opened maintenance schematics, but the official diagrams disagreed with each other like quarrelling grandparents. [345]  
So Milo trusted the language of drips, temperature gradients, and the faint hum of pressure behind valves. [362]  
Following those clues, he shut off upstream gates and unscrewed a corroded junction, letting stagnant sugar-water breathe out in a caramel sigh. [384]  
He spliced in new conduit from his coil, angling it downward toward the black glass doors of the atrium. [403]  
All the while, the broken sextant piece pressed against his thigh, reminding him that orientation mattered even when one navigated plumbing instead of oceans. [427]  
Night settled through high skylights, painting the concourse with violet traces of distant engines no longer departing. [444]  
Milo set up battery lanterns, their cones of light staging an improvised theatre of pipes, valves, and lingering carnival streamers. [464]  
He worked until his knuckles were black with sealant, then forced open the atrium doors. [479]  
Inside, rows of desiccated planters waited like passengers for a bus that never came. [493]  
He reconnected the main feed, and somewhere in the dark a valve clicked, allowing the redirected flows to begin their quiet pilgrimage. [515]  
Thin streams hissed through root channels, dissolving caramel residue into sweet-smelling vapor. [527]  
Milo watched, neither hopeful nor cynical, but suspended in the stoic wonder of witnessing systems remember themselves. [544]  
The sextant piece felt suddenly warm, as if aligning to a star no chart recorded. [559]  
He held it up, and lantern light struck the microdegree marks, casting fractal shadows that overlaid the atrium like an invisible compass rose. [582]  
By that borrowed constellation he oriented the planters, rotating them a few degrees to catch morning sun that would spill through the eastern skylight. [606]  
A quiet trickle became a steady murmur, and the air accepted a cool humidity that softened the brittle leaves. [625]  
Somewhere beneath the floor, pumps long thought dead coughed awake, their impellers lubricated by the sugar-water's viscosity. [642]  
The terminal itself seemed to inhale, as though the redirected flows had resurrected not just the garden but the building's slumbering spirit. [664]  
Milo did not claim victory; he merely recorded pressure readings, his findings adding up to a humble new equation for hope. [685]  
Hope equaled flow multiplied by orientation, divided by the distance between what a place was and what it might yet become. [706]  
He wrote it on the back of a ride voucher, then slipped the note and the sextant piece into a maintenance locker for whoever arrived next. [732]  
Outside, the night wind rattled carnival litter against the glass, sounding almost like applause from an audience already on the road. [753]  
Milo smiled once, a small engineering gesture, and turned off the lanterns to let the stars finish the work. [772]
