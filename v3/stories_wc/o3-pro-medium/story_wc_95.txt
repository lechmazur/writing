Rainlight quilted the glass atrium beside the quiet brook, shimmering like fractured pewter. [13]  
Inside, Orrin Vane, dueling philosopher with a mechanical arm, paced in dignified chaos. [26]  
He was waiting, but waiting had never meant stillness to him. [37]  
Ideas sparred in his skull the way foils beat breastplates in midnight courtyards. [50]  
Across the marble floor stood Ambassador Lys, as diplomatically fierce as a treaty carved in ice. [66]  
She, too, was waiting, though her patience resembled a bowstring drawn but not loosed. [80]  
Between them rested an antique danish tin sewing needle card, its lid painted with swans. [95]  
It was their duel's chosen weapon, sharper than steel where it mattered most. [108]  
Every filament inside carried a note of a hidden overture, inked so small it hummed. [123]  
The score waited to be heard, but first it had to be fought for. [137]  
Orrin extended his mechanical arm, brass fingers unfolding into a rapier-length rod of whirring cogs. [152]  
Lys bowed, drawing from her sleeve a foil too thin to catch the hesitant light. [167]  
They would fence not flesh but philosophies, carving stances into statements the other must rebut. [182]  
The brook outside gurgled applause, ignorant of the treaties hatching inside glass walls. [195]  
First form, the Questioning Thrust, demanded Orrin ask where certainty ends and wonder begins. [209]  
He lunged, and his rod traced a glimmering curve above the needle card. [222]  
Lys parried, turning the inquiry into a riposte about responsibility for unanswered dreams. [235]  
Each metallic kiss of blades shifted the card a hair's breadth, aligning it with the half-painted sundial at the atrium's edge. [256]  
The sundial's gnomon almost hid beneath dripping ivy, its hour marks unfinished, but its angles were code. [273]  
Orrin knew the method: via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial, direction could sing. [288]  
Yet only when the overture inside the needles harmonized with their debate would the path unfold. [304]  
So they spoke through steel, each question an advance, each answer a withdrawal into deeper stance. [320]  
Sweat beaded on glass panels overhead as clouds pressed low, smudging the world beyond. [334]  
Inside, dignified chaos crescendoed: library ladders toppled, quills flared like startled sparrows, yet their focus stayed sharp. [351]  
Lys executed the Diplomat's Feint, a flourish that asked how to keep peace without freezing possibility. [367]  
Orrin answered by letting his mechanical elbow overextend, exposing gears, willingly vulnerable to prove growth needs risk. [384]  
Metal met foil in a resonant chord, and the sundial caught a beam of renegade sun. [400]  
That slanted light flashed through the atrium, struck the tin lid, and spilled across the floor like notation. [418]  
In luminous bars, measures of the hidden overture now glowed between their feet. [431]  
The duel paused; even questions must inhale. [438]  
Lys lowered her sword and asked the single sentence that always unsettled Orrin: 'Where do you wish to arrive?' [457]  
He replied, 'I hope to turn questions into destinations, so arrival never ends the journey.' [472]  
The overture's bars brightened, acknowledging his motive stamped beneath every orbiting thought. [484]  
Music unheard but visible threaded upward, clinking against rafters like coins in an invisible fountain. [499]  
The coded angles turned that music into vectors, sketching an archway of shadow and light beside the brook. [517]  
Mist poured through the forming portal, carrying the scent of notebooks not yet written. [531]  
Lys sheathed her foil and offered Orrin the danish tin sewing needle card with ceremonial grace. [547]  
'Your arm pierced the greater argument,' she said, 'and so the overture is yours to conduct.' [563]  
Orrin accepted, feeling the weight of swans and song and steel compressed in a palmful. [578]  
But he extended the card back to her, hand steadied by brass servos and fresh humility. [594]  
'No philosopher travels alone,' he murmured, 'and no destination forgives a single author.' [607]  
Together they stepped through the archway while waiting became walking, and walking became another duel of discovery. [624]  
Behind them, the glass atrium resettled, quills arranging themselves, ladders rising, sunlight pruning the mess into memory. [641]  
The brook kept speaking its cheerful footnotes long after the philosophers had turned the last question into somewhere new. [660]
