The ancient temple library lost in time exhaled dust like incense in the blue dusk between worlds. [17]  
Shelved corridors spiraled inward until silence became a weight, and within that hush walked Lysar, the diminutive titan. [35]  
His stature barely reached a mortal child's shoulder, yet his presence was regally unpretentious, like a crown fashioned of river stones. [56]  
Generations ago, he had sworn to guard the truth etched in those scrolls and to unmask a pretender to the throne who now basked in stolen homage. [83]  
The pretender's lies seeped through courts like oil, so Lysar chose subtler currents, sending warnings through cryptic messages left in library books. [105]  
Only the patient or the desperate ever found them, tracing smudged margins and punctures where an iron gall ink pellet had broken like a dark seed. [131]  
Inside each stain coiled the rune of drift, an ancient sigil that made thoughts slide sideways, revealing hidden layers as moonlight reveals frost on glass. [156]  
Across the pause of shifting constellations, years folded like paper cranes, and Lysar watched alliances bloom and wither without raising so much as a whisper. [181]  
Time inside the temple behaved strangely, fluttering in stalled gusts, so the titan never aged beyond the silver dust that settled on his lashes. [205]  
Meanwhile, outside, the pretender consolidated power, forging treaties with steel and spectacle, each triumph another stone in the architecture of looming calamity. [227]  
Yet the realm's faith in lineage quivered, because Lysar's coded margins suggested the true heir lived but was veiled by sorcery and indolent history. [251]  
One brittle dawn, a scholar named Selestine stumbled upon the rune of drift while chasing metaphors for her thesis on celestial pauses. [273]  
The sigil sent her mind gliding beyond the known paragraphs, and she read Lysar's warnings as if they were spoken aloud beside her ear. [297]  
A quiet fervor ignited within her, because the idea of a counterfeit crown offended her devotion to ordered truth. [316]  
She sought the diminutive titan in the shadowed rotunda where forgotten atlases slept under chains of verdigris. [333]  
Lysar emerged from between colossal folios like a lantern soul, and the two forged an alliance stitched with mutual humility. [353]  
Selestine possessed the reach of living years; Lysar held the lore of the suspended stars; together they plotted a graceful collapse of deception. [376]  
First, they amplified the cryptic messages, weaving them through treatises on agriculture, love poetry, and glossaries of extinct winds, so every reader would taste suspicion. [401]  
Then Selestine smuggled an iron gall ink pellet into the royal scriptorium, disguising it as a seal bead, knowing the pretender loved ostentatious stationery. [425]  
When the pellet cracked under heat, the rune of drift bloomed across a proclamation announcing the pretender's anniversary jubilee. [444]  
Every eye that traced the proclamation felt reality tilt, and the inscription seemed to question itself, whispering of bloodlines gone awry. [465]  
Court mathematicians recalculated genealogy; bards revised epics mid-verse; nobles wondered which oath to honor, and doubt crept like ivy toward the gilded throne. [488]  
Sensing unrest, the pretender convened a midnight audience inside the glassy Hall of Mirrors, hoping brilliance would drown rumor. [507]  
Lysar and Selestine attended, hidden within a procession of scribes, their plan sharpened to one irrevocable verb: sunder. [525]  
At the zenith of ceremony, Lysar stepped onto a mirror dais; though tiny, his reflection multiplied into towering silhouettes that silenced the hall. [548]  
He spoke not of lineage but of weight, explaining how truth bends space, how crowns are only lenses, and how lies distort vision until kingdoms resemble funhouse corridors. [576]  
As his words rippled, Selestine hurled a second pellet onto the largest mirror, and the rune of drift erupted, sundering every reflection into separate possible histories. [602]  
Some shards showed the rightful heir, a quiet shepherd child, others showed fire and ruin, but all shards excluded the pretender, who stared at his own vanishing. [629]  
The court felt a collective vertigo and knelt, not in obedience but in self-preservation, embracing the new axis revealed within the splintered glass. [652]  
In that moment, across the pause of shifting constellations, the throne became empty so it might be genuine again, and the hall sighed like a book closing. [679]  
Lysar bowed to Selestine, then faded between pillars, his task complete, his regally unpretentious silhouette shrinking into legend as dawn dripped through broken windows. [703]  
The ancient temple library lost in time welcomed him back, shelves rearranging imperceptibly, preparing for whatever truths would next require careful ink and patient collapse. [728]  
Outside, the constellation gears lurched forward again, their hiatus over, while a shepherd child was summoned, bewildered yet luminous, toward a future newly cleared of mirrors. [754]
