I found Marlen halfway up the infinite staircase. [8]  
He sat on a step that had no number, because numbers ended miles below. [22]  
Clouds moved under us like discarded thoughts, yet he stared upward, grim and oddly hopeful. [37]  
Marlen was what he called a grim optimist, balancedly daring and stubbornly alive. [50]  
His knuckles clutched a pair of dice, one chipped, edges glinting with worn ivory. [64]  
Each time the staircase bent into mist he tossed them, recorded the sum in chalk, and climbed. [81]  
He claimed he was measuring perpetual motion not by wheels, but by the statistics of chances. [97]  
I scoffed, and he answered with a notebook fattened by cramped equations. [109]  
Through mathematical proofs he insisted the staircase ascended itself, spending nothing, refusing entropy. [122]  
If he could confirm the loop, he said, we might rupture the secret of regret. [137]  
I asked why regret mattered more than escape. [145]  
He smiled the way broken clocks smile: because they still know noon passes twice. [159]  
"I missed one chance," he murmured, rolling the chipped die along his palm. [172]  
The stair below us flickered, reminding me that gravity had lost its appointment here. [186]  
He would not say what chance he lost; instead he asked me to audit his logic. [202]  
So we sat, chalk between us, dice clicking like nervous beetles. [213]  
Every roll, every sum, every proof, he chained to the next riser as though constructing rails. [229]  
He argued that a staircase without end is motion without travel, and thus the perfect machine. [245]  
Yet something in him kept looking down, as if perpetual motion could rewind the past. [260]  
Night never arrived here, but a darker brightness settled, and our shadows lengthened upward. [274]  
Marlen's voice turned brittle. [278]  
"Each proof closes a wound," he whispered, "yet the final seam refuses." [290]  
I asked him what seam. [295]  
He opened his palm: the chipped die showed a scarlet six, the other glittered blank. [310]  
"Probability is memory," he said. [315]  
"This chip marks the one evening I failed to gamble for her forgiveness. [328]  
So I froze, and the dice fell from my pocket onto stone, scarring this edge." [343]  
"Now I roll until the staircase loops and carries me back to that hour." [357]  
I realized then that boundless confinement was his chosen climate, not his prison. [370]  
He pursued geometry like others chase locksmiths, hoping the right angle would unlock time. [384]  
I felt the staircase pulse underfoot, an arterial thud that made numbers bleed into one another. [400]  
Perhaps his proofs were rewriting the architecture, teasing a closed loop from an open wound. [415]  
I worried what would rupture if the loop succeeded: the stair, the sky, or Marlen himself. [431]  
Still, I could not abandon him to infinite ascent. [440]  
I offered a compromise: throw once more, but let me choose the question we asked the dice. [457]  
He agreed, weary eyes kindling with the coal of possibility. [467]  
I asked not for a reversal, but for the texture of his missed opportunity. [481]  
Could a number reveal feel, scent, weight, the subtle give of skin against fate? [495]  
He shook the dice as if rattling doors in a windstorm. [506]  
They leapt, clattered, spun, and halted on the edge of a step that leaned toward dusk. [522]  
The unchipped die showed zero, a face I had never seen; the chipped showed a trembling one. [539]  
Marlen inhaled sharply, as if the numbers exhaled the lost evening's perfume. [551]  
He described the scent of rain on bakery bricks, the weight of apology unsaid, the warmth of her hand withdrawing. [571]  
Each detail folded around us, and the staircase paused, as though listening. [583]  
He wept, but the tears were equations too, charting acceleration of longing toward release. [597]  
I saw then that perpetual motion could be halted only by embracing stillness, not by outracing it. [614]  
We erased the sums, wiping chalk from stone and skin until the numbers lost voice. [629]  
The staircase shuddered, no longer certain which direction meant forward. [639]  
Treads unfolded into terraces, and clouds drifted in to lay themselves like carpets. [652]  
Marlen placed the dice on a landing that widened into a quiet room neither of us remembered climbing past. [671]  
There he sat, breathing fully for the first time, no longer ascending, no longer hunting. [686]  
The chipped edge caught the dim light and looked healed. [696]  
I felt the loop loosen from the world, untying both of us from its iron necklace. [712]  
Freedom arrived not as flight but as a landing wide enough to stand beside regret without falling. [729]  
We watched the staircase continue upward without us, endless yet oddly finite when no desire chased it. [746]  
Marlen thanked me, voice steady, optimism still grim but finally at rest. [758]  
I answered by sitting beside him, and together we listened for the silence between probabilities. [773]
