The skiff nosed through pearlescent fog as brackish waves slapped its hull in a restless meter. [16]  
Iona, the spirited driftwood sculptor, leaned over the prow, tasting salt like punctuation on her lips. [32]  
She had set out at dawn to deliver a commission, but every bearing vanished after the GPS fails. [50]  
Now the sea sounded like a hidden turbine-hum reverie, equal parts lullaby and subtle threat. [65]  
Her only landmark emerged suddenly: a storm-tossed archway of basalt, its keystone dripping with foam. [80]  
Iona rowed beneath the dark lintel, feeling as if she were crossing from linear hours into braided ones. [98]  
On the far side, the water stilled and revealed a cove lit by violet sky, as though twilight had nested early. [119]  
An abandoned lighthouse crouched at the beach, broken glass glittering like scattered codes. [132]  
Drawn by both fear and curiosity, she hauled the skiff onto sand and trudged toward the door. [149]  
Inside, wind moaned down spiral stairs, yet a single beam of light streamed from a dusty cabinet. [166]  
There she found a brass-framed magic lantern slide, its glass etched with overlapping silhouettes of ships, trees, and faces. [185]  
When she tilted it toward the beam, the room blurred, and the etchings projected onto the salt-stained walls. [203]  
Ships sailed across plaster, trees sprouted along mortar seams, and faces whispered in half-heard languages. [218]  
Iona felt the slide inviting her to reimagine not only the room but chronology itself. [233]  
She was perpetually learning from wood grain and tide rhythms; now she would learn from light sewn with shadow. [252]  
She rotated the slide a fraction, layering a nineteenth-century brig atop a present-day freighter, and understood the phrase timewoven alliances. [272]  
The images cooperated, masts and antennas knotting together until two crews saluted across stitched decades. [287]  
A simple turn produced complexity, yet the gestures remained elegant, as if history wished to scaffold complexity with simplicity. [306]  
That wish echoed her own artistic credo, hammered into every gull-winged sculpture she had ever assembled from storm debris. [325]  
But the lantern demanded more than admiration; it pulsed, urging movement like a conductor raising a baton. [342]  
Iona inserted herself into the projection, letting silhouettes consume her outline until she stood amid the conjoined ships. [360]  
Sailors in oilskin and engineers in neon vests conversed, their speech weaving through layered meanings she barely grasped. [378]  
They spoke of currents that spiraled downstream and upstream at once, of deals struck between mornings and memories. [396]  
These were the timewoven alliances, compacts that allowed different eras to share resources so none would founder alone. [414]  
In exchange, each era pledged a craftsperson to interpret the agreements into tangible art, so future eyes might read them. [434]  
The crews gestured toward her calloused hands, recognizing her as that emissary. [446]  
Accepting, Iona felt the cove pivot; tongues of violet light licked the hull of the imaginary flotilla. [463]  
Through the archway, thunder roared, yet inside the lighthouse a hush bloomed, airy as freshly planed cedar. [480]  
She withdrew the slide, and with it the projections, but their impressions lingered like fingerprints on water. [497]  
Outside, the fog had thinned, revealing driftwood strewn across the beach in serpentine patterns that felt deliberate. [514]  
Remembering her vow, she gathered the pale logs, selecting limbs already curved by tide into cursive gestures. [531]  
She would carve a gate echoing the basalt arch, but light enough for children to swing open with one hand. [551]  
Within its frame she planned to inlay slender panes cut from the magic lantern slide, each shard a semaphore between centuries. [572]  
Creating it would require navigating paradox, yet her aim stayed simple: to scaffold complexity with simplicity, as the alliances taught. [592]  
Days bled into nights while she worked beside the lighthouse, the turbine-hum reverie of wind and waves her metronome. [611]  
She was perpetually learning new balances, how to let a chisel pause so the wood could propose its own angle. [631]  
At completion, the gate rose on the sand like an opened book, pages made of grain and glass. [649]  
She dragged it to the waterline and anchored it with braided kelp ropes, aligning its threshold to the basalt arch beyond. [670]  
When dawn poured rose light through both apertures, the wood shimmered, and silhouettes of mingled sailors and engineers marched across the tide. [692]  
Villagers arrived by fishing boat, awestruck, and stepped through the gate to feel time loosen, then retie itself kindly around them. [713]  
From the sand dune, Iona watched, satisfied that the once-lost voyage had summoned a harbor larger than longitude. [731]  
The tide hummed, the lantern glowed faintly in her pack, and the future awaited the next hand willing to reimagine everything. [752]
