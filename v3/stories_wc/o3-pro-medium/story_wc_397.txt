Mara stepped onto the creaking pier of the drift-ice marina, the sky humming with gulls and distant propeller drones. [19]  
She carried only a stamped passport marking her as a euthanasia tourist and the heirloom lace parasol tip she had pocketed from her grandmother's attic. [44]  
The fragile ivory knob, once hidden beneath looping embroidery, clicked in her palm like a metronome measuring the remainder of her resolve. [66]  
Since the mudslide, she gripped reality loosely, as if every surface were coated in melting sleet that might betray her fingers. [87]  
She had volunteered in the valley out of distant guilt, and through disaster relief volunteering she had been reborn amid sirens and soil. [110]  
But after waking up changed beneath a makeshift tarp, cradled by strangers, she discovered her pulse beat a quieter rhythm than before. [132]  
In that hush she first heard what she thought was the edge of endings, a silk rustle beneath the thunder. [152]  
Now she had come here to learn the sound of approaching endings, hoping the sea ice might echo the same syllables. [173]  
The receptionist at the clinic would not open for three days, a fold in patience she had been instructed to endure. [194]  
So Mara offered her remaining hours to the harbor crew who trawl shattered fishing crates from between the bergs, exchanging paperwork for work gloves. [218]  
The foreman, a woman with frost on her eyelashes, accepted with a nod that felt older than the mountains. [237]  
Windborne solace drifted around the docks, a breathing hush between clinks of chains and the brittle crack of moving ice. [257]  
Each morning she helped guide the small trawler past floes the size of rooftops, snagging splintered planks, lost photographs, and once a child's red boot. [282]  
Every salvage brought a different timbre of finality, as though endings had many dialects and she was slowly becoming fluent. [302]  
During breaks she sat on a bollard, turning the heirloom lace parasol tip between gloved fingers, listening to wind scud through its tiny holes. [326]  
Sometimes the tip whistled softly, and the note resembled the sigh she had heard the landslide release before the valley fell. [347]  
She wondered whether any belonging, once detached, became an oracle for those willing to place an ear against its wound. [367]  
On the third evening a blizzard closed the roads, trapping the crew aboard the maintenance shack that floated on pontoons. [387]  
Snow hissed against corrugated walls while the marina groaned like a tired leviathan shifting armor. [402]  
Inside, a coal stove glowed, and conversations curled upward with steam from mugs of tar-black coffee. [418]  
The foreman passed Mara a harmonica battered by salt and asked if she knew any songs for listless nights. [437]  
Mara placed the parasol tip beside her, lifted the harmonica, and exhaled a wavering chord that reminded her of ambulance sirens fading uphill. [460]  
The crew fell silent, not from sadness but from recognition, as if someone had opened a curtain on the stage of their own memories. [484]  
When the note tapered off, Mara heard another sound, faint yet sure, rising outside—the distant snap of ice calves breaking free. [505]  
She excused herself and stepped onto the deck, the storm having softened into swirling crystals that caught lantern light like drifting seeds. [527]  
Across the black channel, slabs parted with a throaty crack, then hummed as they rubbed together, a tectonic lullaby only the sleepless hear. [550]  
Mara closed her eyes and realized the marina itself was speaking in the plural accents of endings, not cruel but utterly certain. [572]  
She felt no urge to hurry the clinic visit; instead she sensed a new shoreline unfolding inside her, one lined with patient bells. [595]  
Perhaps the final lesson was not an isolated tone but a slow chord you must trawl from ordinary hours, letting water rinse each note. [619]  
She turned the parasol tip in her pocket once more, feeling a fold in patience settle, and listened to the ice breathe alongside her own lungs. [645]  
Windborne solace carried the mingled sounds over the water, and Mara understood she had already begun to learn what she had come for. [668]  
Not every voyage ends at the expected harbor, she mused, but the horizon still lowers its lantern when you arrive. [688]  
Behind her the crew started to sing, their voices threading through the stove pipe and along the rim of the night like warm rope. [712]  
Mara waited until the song settled, then whispered thanks to the cold and walked back inside, bearing the quiet weight of postponed departure. [735]  
Somewhere beyond the shutters the ice continued to speak, but its syllables now harmonized with her breath instead of overshadowing it. [756]
