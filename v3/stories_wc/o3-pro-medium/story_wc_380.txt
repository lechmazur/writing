Gleaming silence settled over Tideford after the whale beaches, muffling even gull cries. [13]  
Kerrin, the dock-side lantern lighter, trimmed her wick-knives without striking a spark. [25]  
Night demanded light, but the harbor wanted darkness to brood over its dead leviathan. [39]  
She obeyed the harbor, folding her tinder into the apron pocket where pressed wildflowers lay. [54]  
They were brittle souvenirs from summers she could no longer recall, petals locked yet scentless. [69]  
Every year memories vanished from Tideford minds like gulls blown beyond the headland, destination unknown. [84]  
Kerrin wished to find where deleted memories go, before hers drained away entirely. [97]  
The whale's stranded bulk, rumor said, hid a clue. [106]  
So she slipped past cordons, carrying her unlit lantern and a dented tin of coffee. [121]  
Kerrin believed answers could be read through patterns in coffee grounds, if brewed where gravity was uncertain. [138]  
Her grandmother had once whispered of pockets of gravity beneath stranded giants, places where time tilted. [154]  
If gravity itself fluctuates mysteriously, perhaps memory falls into those hollows, she reasoned. [167]  
Wind rattled fish scales on drying racks, but inside the maw was warmth and hush. [182]  
She crouched beside ribs bigger than masts, unpacked her kettle, and lit a single coal. [197]  
Steam curled upward yet slid sideways, proving odd gravity already tugged at water and breath. [212]  
She poured coffee, waited, then upended the cup onto a saucer of whale-bone she chipped free. [228]  
When she lifted the cup, grounds formed spirals like constellations collapsing into a black-pit center. [243]  
Within that dark core she saw a salt crystal growing chamber, lit by sourceless moonlight. [258]  
The vision pulsed, and she heard no sound, only the gleaming silence of dissolving sodium stars. [274]  
There, flickering like moths under glass, fluttered memories: fishermen's first kisses, schoolyard shames, songs unborn. [289]  
They drifted until crystals caged them, preserving but erasing from waking minds. [301]  
To free them, the grounds insisted, she must exhume the earliest crystal core before dawn. [316]  
Kerrin blinked, and the saucer dissolved into sand; she now knelt at the tidal flats. [331]  
The dead whale was gone, leaving only a crater rimmed with shimmering salt. [344]  
Pockets of gravity still dimpled the air, tugging her lantern-hand toward the pit's center. [358]  
She descended carefully, boots crunching over fresh crystals that chimed like tiny bells. [371]  
At the bottom stood a glass coffin woven of salt branches, its lid etched with tide calendars. [388]  
Within, an infant lantern lighter slept, miniature wick-knives clutched against her chest. [400]  
Kerrin recognized her own scarab-shaped birthmark glowing on the child's collarbone. [411]  
The chamber had harvested her earliest memory of self, locking it away to keep gravity balanced. [427]  
Without that anchor, she had drifted through life fogged but obedient to the harbor's wishes. [442]  
She drew a wick-knife, pried at the lid, and salt fractured like hoarfrost. [455]  
Crystals wailed in frequencies below sound, yet the world above remained in gleaming silence. [469]  
She lifted the infant and felt weight surge; pockets of gravity stitched themselves into coherence. [484]  
Memories cascaded back: her mother teaching constellations, her first lantern lit against monsoon night, her laughter. [500]  
Tears blurred the crater, turning salt paths into slick mirrors. [510]  
She realized other townsfolk also wandered half-alive, their cores interred somewhere deeper. [522]  
The child in her arms stirred, eyes reflecting lanternless stars, and merged into Kerrin's chest like smoke. [539]  
The coffin dissolved, releasing a rush of scents: pressed wildflowers regained fragrance, sea-salt bloomed sweet. [554]  
Gravity steadied, though the air seemed lighter, as if grief had burned away. [567]  
Kerrin packed shards of salt into her apron with the flowers, proof for skeptics. [581]  
She climbed from the pit, lantern still unlit, because dawn painted silver over waves. [595]  
Fishermen gathered, squinting at the vanished whale and the sudden clarity in their eyes. [609]  
Some began humming tunes they had forgotten during winter storms, startled yet comforted. [622]  
Kerrin knew the salt chamber still held endless coffins, but now she possessed a map. [637]  
Spirals in the grounds had etched coordinates onto her memory, shimmering behind every blink. [651]  
She would return with allies, exhume each buried core, and heal Tideford thought by thought. [666]  
Until then, she resumed her rounds, lighting lanterns now with steady hands and steady past. [681]  
Every flame mirrored the salt crystals' glow, reminding her that even silence can gleam with promise. [697]  
And across the harbor, unseen yet certain, the pockets of gravity waited in patient accord. [712]
