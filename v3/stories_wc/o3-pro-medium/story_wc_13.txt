<story>Gray dawn pooled over the city of Harkhar, where rooftops rose like overlapping shelves. [14]  
Between them ran a shallow canal system, silver threads weaving between towers at dizzying height. [29]  
Eira Lorne, a natural history illustrator, balanced her sketch satchel on the lip of a sluice. [45]  
She had come not to paint waterbirds, but to find the place where echoes are born. [61]  
Around her neck hung an infinity symbol pendant, two silver curves locked in perpetual pursuit. [76]  
It glowed faintly, pulsing with a rhythm whose interrupted cadence had haunted her dreams for weeks. [92]  
Whenever the pulse stalled, roofs shuddered, and gulls paused mid-cry as though time itself hiccuped. [107]  
Eira understood, better than anyone, that she was the cause. [117]  
The pendant was her chisel, and she sculpts time itself with strokes most cannot even name. [133]  
She did not create minutes from nothing; she borrowed them. [143]  
Below the masonry, a stone giant lay curled under the entire metropolis, snoring hurricanes into subway tunnels. [160]  
His nap lasted centuries, and each exhalation released spare seconds Eira could pry loose. [174]  
By borrowing time from that slumber, she advanced or delayed local moments, sketching chronology like charcoal lines. [191]  
Tonight she meant to uncage something older than speech: the first resonance that ever bounced off stone. [208]  
Her notes claimed the birthing-room of echoes floated where the rooftop canals converged into a quiet whirlpool. [225]  
To reach it, she had to ride the water during the brief stillness between the giant's inhalation and exhalation. [244]  
That stillness was the heart of the interrupted cadence, a hollow beat in the city's hidden drum. [261]  
Rain began, soft as eraser crumbs, greasing the tiles. [270]  
Eira stepped onto a narrow punt moored to a chimney and unfurled a canvas wing to catch the drainage flow. [290]  
Water lifted the craft, and she pushed off, her stylus tucked behind her ear like a conductor's baton. [308]  
Roof after roof slipped beneath, the canal a ribbon of ink between pages of slate. [323]  
She listened for the giant's inhale, a deep subterranean drawl that set windowpanes trembling. [337]  
When that breath ended, silence clapped shut like a sketchbook, and every droplet hung motionless. [352]  
Borrowed seconds flooded her pockets, warm and granular, ready to be kneaded into shape. [366]  
Eira pressed the infinity symbol pendant, twisting the loops so they overlapped in impossible perspective. [381]  
The water ahead lengthened like pulled glass, forming a corridor beyond ordinary geometry. [394]  
She guided the punt into that corridor, borrowing more of the nap to keep the passage open. [411]  
The cadence lurched, one half-beat missing, and the city lights flickered in alarm. [424]  
Somewhere a bell began to toll, then stopped mid-peal, its voice imprisoned in still air. [439]  
She had no guilt; uncaging required first proving the bars existed. [450]  
Far ahead, the corridor opened into a courtyard sized like a raindrop but suspended above dozens of spires. [468]  
Here water spiraled without falling, a quiet whirlpool wrapped around a single stone cage. [482]  
Inside that lattice hovered a trembling mote of sound, visible only because time wore no skin there. [499]  
Eira recognized it from childhood caves, from seashells, from the hush after thunder. [512]  
It was the proto-echo, the ur-sound every later echo merely imitated. [523]  
She understood why it had been jailed: cities need delayed voices to measure distance, and raw echo would end that commerce. [544]  
Yet the illustrator in her longed to sketch the unmediated world, where call and answer shared the same breath. [563]  
She pulled the stylus, dipped its charcoal tip into borrowed seconds, and drew a continuous line around the cage. [582]  
The line formed an infinity symbol that overlapped itself, matching the pendant's impossible twist. [596]  
Time thinned where the charcoal lay, and the bars dissolved like sand washed from glass. [611]  
The mote of sound slipped free, a silver gasp blooming outward in concentric ripples. [625]  
Ripples struck tower walls, and every balcony sang the words last spoken upon it. [639]  
Lovers relived confessions, merchants rebartered, infants re-cried, all within the single borrowed moment. [652]  
Then cadence resumed with a thunderous double-beat, as if to catch up on paused heartbeats. [667]  
The corridor behind her collapsed, water splashing back into linear time, and the giant turned on his side. [685]  
Eira's borrowed seconds emptied; her stylus cracked, but she heard the newborn echoes scattering like starlings. [701]  
She opened her sketchbook and began drawing what she heard, for illustration now required no sight at all. [719]  
High above the waking city, her lines fluttered across the pages with an uninterrupted cadence that belonged only to freedom. [739]</story>
