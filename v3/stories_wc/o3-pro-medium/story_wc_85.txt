Elias Marr stood alone on the cobalt terrace at dusk, listening to the sea echo through the arches of the abandoned villa. [22]  
The salt air carried a sieved hush, as though each wave held back a confession it refused to name. [41]  
Tempered regret pressed on his ribs, a familiar ache he had earned in a decade of forging bloodlines for the desperate rich. [63]  
He was, after all, a guilt-ridden black market genealogist who quietly manufactures false memories to match the papers he sells. [83]  
Tonight his trade felt like a shackle rather than a craft. [94]  
In his pocket lay the broken watch hand that had unsettled every certainty he had sold. [110]  
It belonged, legend whispered, to a child erased from the grand Valcouer lineage he had fabricated last winter. [128]  
The mother had insisted the boy never existed, and Elias had helped her quell the last archives of his being. [148]  
Yet the watch hand surfaced in a pawnshop three days ago, ticking faintly with unanswered blame. [164]  
Its single gear turned against the laws of rust, pointing Elias toward the coast he had fled as a youth. [184]  
So he returned, under the weight of unspoken words, searching for testimony no registry could burn. [200]  
The villa, crumbling above the tide, was the only roof left from his childhood village. [215]  
Below the cliff a narrow path twisted to a forgotten shore where fishermen once carved saints from driftwood during long storms. [236]  
Elias descended, guided by the faint click of the watch hand in his palm. [250]  
The beach stretched silver under the moonrise, littered with warped figurines half buried in sand. [265]  
He began his penance by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore, hoping shape and grain would speak. [284]  
Each figurine he lifted seemed to breathe, the hollows between splinters forming mouths too tired for accusation. [301]  
Still, the silence felt narrower than before, as though the shore itself practiced confession. [315]  
He sorted the carvings into piles: sailors, serpents, saints, and children, allowing patterns to reveal themselves. [331]  
The children had holes in their chests, as if something vital had been scooped out before the wood dried. [350]  
Elias pressed the watch hand into one hollow, and the carving shuddered like a heart restarting. [366]  
Suddenly the piles shifted in a hush deeper than the first, a hush sifted, sieved hush, leaving only the densest echoes behind. [388]  
The figurines arranged themselves into a corridor pointing toward a cave at the end of the inlet. [405]  
Elias followed, heartbeat clashing with the surf. [412]  
Inside the cave, phosphorescent algae illuminated a bench carved from bleached roots. [424]  
Upon the bench lay a ledger bound in kelp twine and a single page torn free. [440]  
His name scrawled the heading, ink steady, judgment calm. [449]  
Below, the story of the erased child unfurled not as fiction but as history: a twin brother Elias had let drown when they were seven. [474]  
Terror swallowed the cool cave air. [480]  
All his adult frauds, all the genealogies he had doctored, began to spiral around that first omission. [497]  
He realized he had never invented new lies, only rehearsed the original one in different coats. [513]  
The watch hand ticked once, soundless, then fell dead. [522]  
In that instant Elias understood his drive to discover the weight of a withheld truth was simply an urge to measure his own. [545]  
He clutched the ledger, trembling, and stepped back into the moonlight. [556]  
The figurine corridor had collapsed, yet the carvings now floated upright on the tide like mourners. [572]  
Elias knelt and spoke his brother's name, a syllable kept silent for twenty years. [586]  
The sea answered with a ripple that climbed his shins and cooled his nerves. [600]  
He felt something inside him quell, not disappear, but settle like sand after a storm. [615]  
From the shifting water one child carving drifted into his hands, its chest no longer hollow. [631]  
He placed the broken watch hand where a heart should be and felt it fuse to the wood. [649]  
A pulse of weak light flickered beneath the grain, then faded into calm. [662]  
Elias did not know whether he had summoned magic or madness, but he sensed the ledger would now alter itself. [682]  
Perhaps it would write a truer memory, or leave blank space where grief could breathe. [697]  
Either way, Elias resolved never again to sell lineage like counterfeit silk. [709]  
He would walk the coasts cataloging what was, not what wallets wished had been. [723]  
Behind him the forgotten shore exhaled, and the sieved hush became simple night wind. [737]  
Tempered regret remained, but it no longer commanded him; it simply reminded him which tides to respect. [754]  
With the ledger under his arm and the carving on his heart, Elias began the long climb back to the terrace, already feeling dawn loosen the dark. [781]
