Silas Ning crouched at the base of the glass spire by the frozen lake, listening to how the wind skimmed its panes like tentative fingertips. [25]  
Every vibration hinted at a note, and every note belonged to a symphony that no orchestra had yet agreed to hear. [46]  
His ambition, secret and relentless, was to become the conductor of unheard symphonies, air-borne movements legible only to resonant surfaces. [66]  
For funds he penned cryptic fortunes, sliding them into cookies baked by night vendors who never read the riddles they sold. [87]  
Yet each fragment of advice was really a rehearsal mark, a whispered cue for the spire to remember what to sing. [108]  
At dawn the lake turned to liquid mirror, and the horizon doubled itself until sky and ice exchanged faces in perfect, bewildering symmetry. [131]  
Silas called that apparition a mirrored horizon, the threshold where echoes were loudest because light itself was undecided about direction. [151]  
On this particular morning he carried a nautilus shell segment he had polished until its chambers glowed like small crescent rooms. [172]  
Within those curling rooms lived the oldest lullaby he remembered, sung by a mother whose face time kept deliberately blurry. [192]  
Silas was chronologically homesick, grieving not a place but the vanished grammar of ages that no longer fit their sentences. [212]  
By mapping childhood memories onto the spire's crystalline facets, he believed he could tune the structure like a harp of glass. [233]  
He pressed the nautilus piece against a pane, and frost traced the spiral as if taking shorthand from a forgotten lecturer. [254]  
Notes, inaudible to most, rippled through the spire and tickled the ice below, causing subdued cracks that harmonized rather than threatened. [275]  
The world held an upturned hush, a delicate silence curved like palms cradling a newborn secret. [291]  
To keep that hush alive, he recited the latest fortune he had written: 'When reflections breathe, follow the second breath, not the first.' [314]  
At the spire's summit a narrow balcony jutted over the lake, inviting him to step into the very rim of replication. [335]  
He climbed the inner corkscrew stairway, counting heartbeats against each crystalline rung, determined to finish his experiment before exhaustion hits. [355]  
From the balcony he could see dawn re-painting the clouds, their colors sliding down the mirrored horizon like timid acrobats. [375]  
He lifted the shell segment to his lips, not to blow but to let the wind tunnel through its vaulted corridors. [396]  
A chord, shy yet unmistakable, threaded outward and struck the panels of glass, which shimmered as though drowsy eyes had fluttered awake. [418]  
The spire answered with overtones, layering frequencies like translucent veils until the frozen lake quivered and began to hum. [437]  
Beneath the surface, air bubbles arranged themselves into staves, and tiny icefish darted along them like notes fleeing a restless page. [458]  
Silas raised his arms, imagining a baton between his fingers, and let every ache in his lungs translate into tempo. [478]  
The composition unfurled forward and backward in time, soothing his chronologically homesick heart with overlapping eras of melody. [496]  
Listeners might have heard only wind across ice, but the conductor felt thousands of silent throats opening in solidarity. [515]  
He pictured concert halls carved from glaciers, each seat occupied by the memory of a year that humans had misplaced. [535]  
The fortune cookie vendors would never decode how their tiny slips had summoned this auditorium of eras, and he cherished their ignorance. [557]  
Snow began to fall, each flake catching the aurora that crept over the mirrored horizon and stamping it with prismatic applause. [578]  
But Silas dared not linger; the delicacy of inspiration was measured in breaths, and he sensed the final echoes thinning. [598]  
He gathered the shell, the hush, and the mirrored dawn into his coat, promising the spire he would return with fresh fortunes before another cycle of forgetfulness descended. [626]  
As he descended, panes still resonating above him, he realized that somewhere inside the nautilus chambers a new measure had formed, waiting for the next horizon to mirror it. [655]
