Silas Haddon rode the last night convoy across the salt flats, the dreamless freight guard who never closed his eyes to sleep. [22]  
He had once believed he merely suffered insomnia, but now, after the last forest burns, he accepted that dreams themselves had fled the world. [46]  
The convoy braked on a glowing dune in bloom, a hill of radiance where bioluminescent grains opened like flowers under the starless sky. [69]  
Silas dismounted, boots crunching petals of light, and checked the cargo hatches for leaks of heat or hope. [87]  
Within the armored wagons waited the divergent archive, thousands of glass slivers etched with histories that had branched away from ours. [108]  
Scholars said the archive recorded possibilities that might still sprout if a caretaker found the right soil. [125]  
Tonight Silas carried it toward the rumored nurseries beneath the desert, driven by a private vow to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners. [149]  
He knew nothing of botany or prophecy, yet the vow hummed in his chest like a broken lullaby trying to recall its tune. [172]  
As he inspected the seals, he noticed a chess clock frozen at midnight lying beneath a loose strap. [190]  
Neither he nor the quartermaster claimed it, yet the minute hand quivered, sniffing seconds it could no longer bite. [209]  
Silas slipped the clock into his coat, feeling its arrested heartbeat echo his own perpetual wakefulness. [225]  
A hush rolled over the convoy, the kind of silence that is occasionally everywhere, like gravity or guilt. [243]  
Then waves shimmered across the dune, not of sand but of probability, and a woman stepped out of them as though through wave functions given flesh. [269]  
Her eyes glowed blue, fracturing into softer shades when she blinked, like someone both drowning and singing a cradle song. [289]  
She introduced herself as Lira, an archivist from a path the fire never found, and she asked permission to examine the freight. [311]  
Silas, startled yet charmed despite the static in his blood, nodded and unlocked the nearest hatch. [327]  
Inside the wagon glass shards glimmered like wet feathers, and Lira touched them lightly, humming counterpoints that soothed the sharp edges. [348]  
She said each shard was a seed dreaming of entire civilizations, but their slumber required tending, lest they fracture into nonsense. [369]  
Silas admitted he did not dream and feared he could not keep them alive. [383]  
Lira smiled with a sadness older than the dune, explaining that dreams travel best in waking vessels who choose vigilance over comfort. [405]  
She offered to guide him, tracing safe corridors that were invisible but resonant, mapping them by listening to the ticking that no clock made. [429]  
The chess clock in his coat began to warm, though its hands stayed locked at twelve, as if midnight were a direction rather than a moment. [455]  
Silas realized the frozen device was their compass, aligning to possibility instead of latitude, pointing wherever the archive most needed soil. [476]  
To test the theory, he held the clock high; its brass shell pulsed, casting faint chimes that dispersed like pollen into the desert night. [500]  
Particles of sound landed on distant dunes, and where they fell, the sand blushed, opening new veins of light that led downward. [522]  
Lira called the path a subsong, a melody buried under scorched melodies, and she urged Silas to drive the convoy along it before dawnless cold returned. [548]  
Engines roared, freight cars rattled, and Silas felt himself charm the machinery with gentle taps, coaxing rhythm from rust just as mothers soothe children. [572]  
He did not know if the act was skill or prayer, only that the gears responded like listeners grateful for storytime. [593]  
The convoy descended through a throat of shifting sand into caverns lit by subterranean algae, whose glow sang against the metal hulls. [615]  
There, beneath the glowing dune in bloom, chambers unfurled like lungs, ready to breathe archives into being. [632]  
Silas and Lira unloaded the shards onto stone tables warmed by geothermal veins, and each sliver refracted entire dawns onto the damp ceiling. [655]  
The air rippled with half-born syllables, equations, and lullabies that floated like motes then arranged themselves into rows, as if shelves built from echo. [679]  
Silas felt the wave functions threading through him, braiding his wakefulness to the archive until he became a hinge between what was lost and what might arise. [706]  
He thought of the clock still stuck at midnight and understood that frozen time was exactly the soil the seeds required: a pause long enough to imagine. [733]  
Lira sang, a fractured lullaby mending in real time, and sparks flitted from the cavern corners, settling into the shards like fireflies choosing homes. [757]  
When the song ended, Silas finally closed his eyes, not to dream but to listen, knowing that vigilance sometimes means guarding beginnings rather than endings. [782]
