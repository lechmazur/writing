Low tide delivered me to the fog sculpture garden, where statues dissolved in brine and mist like half-remembered vows. [19]  
I came clutching a malfunctioning tape recorder, hungry to capture the sound of growing older before it slipped away. [38]  
Even the gulls were silent, as if the hush of old videotapes left unwatched had leaked into the air. [57]  
Somewhere inside the swirling gray, a figure rearranged driftwood with the gravity of a cartographer drawing borders on soft clay. [77]  
He was the junkyard prophet, locally famous for predictions he forgot moments after uttering them. [92]  
Rusty license plates dangled from his coat like devotional medals, clinking a rhythm older than the harbor itself. [110]  
He looked up, eyes bright with tidal longing none of us landlocked listeners could ever fake. [126]  
Without greeting, he pressed a piece of plain chalk into my palm, its surface sea-cold and stubbornly dry. [144]  
Keep this, he murmured, because you will forget why you need it before you need it. [160]  
The paradox tasted like salt on my tongue, but I pocketed the chalk and followed him deeper among the statues. [180]  
He located our path by arranging driftwood as directional markers, each branch pointing to the echo of a footprint rather than the footprint itself. [204]  
I wondered how one could navigate by echoes, but the prophet answered questions before I could voice them, then promptly forgot he had. [227]  
Precognitively forgetful, he called it, a curse that let tomorrow flash open like a match, then drop into water. [246]  
Still, every match left smoke, and he clung to those faint spirals the way driftwood clings to a tide. [265]  
Clinging to echoes, he said, was the only reliable cartography for places memory feared to name. [281]  
We stopped beside a marble whale whose blowhole exhaled nothing but fog, and he lifted my recorder like an offering. [301]  
Listen beyond the stone, he whispered, for the grain of time scrapes louder in silence. [316]  
I pressed record, yet all I heard was the soft chord of blood in my ears and the distant lift of surf. [338]  
Frustration rose, but the prophet scrawled a spiral on a nearby plinth, using the chalk I thought still nested in my pocket. [360]  
The spiral glowed not with light, but with an older sound, like a childhood conversation remembered only in rhythm. [379]  
As it shimmered, statues around us began to vibrate, releasing notes too weathered to be music yet too deliberate to be noise. [401]  
Those notes braided into a tide-born melody, and in them I heard knees creak, letters yellow, and birthdays recede like buoys at dusk. [424]  
The recorder needle quivered, engraving invisible grooves that promised to hold age itself if I did not breathe too loudly. [444]  
Then the prophet staggered, as though remembering a future misstep, and the melody faltered into scattered shells of sound. [463]  
He asked where we were, eyes fogged like the seashore after ships depart, and I realized the match had drowned again. [484]  
Desperate to anchor him, I replayed the recording, but only wind hissed, erasing every wrinkle the melody had etched. [503]  
He smiled sadly, saying that forgetting was the price of knowing where to place the driftwood, and now he owed more driftwood. [525]  
I wanted to protest, but the statues had already rotated, their faces pointing toward a horizon we could not see. [545]  
He gathered fresh branches washed ashore, arranging driftwood as directional markers in a new geometry I failed to decode. [564]  
Each marker showed him where the next memory would be forgotten, guiding us deeper, looping us back, like an undertow disguised as guidance. [587]  
Nightfall fused with the fog until distance and darkness became synonyms, and the old videotapes in my satchel finally began to whir. [609]  
Their unwatched stories leaked through plastic casings, layering new hush over the garden, muffling even our footfalls. [626]  
The prophet touched one cassette and whispered a date I did not yet live, then shrugged, already unsure why his lips were moving. [649]  
I realized the true recording was never meant for magnetic tape but for marrow, carved by moments we could only half-hear. [670]  
So I opened my ears wider than my doubts and followed him, clinging to echoes that felt like tomorrow's rust beneath today's fingertips. [693]
