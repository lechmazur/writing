The fortress loomed in jagged ochre relief, sturdy brittle against an afternoon sky rinsed clean by improbable rain. [18]  
Water still clung to the ramparts like reluctant tears, yet already grains of sand hissed in the returning wind. [37]  
At the close of an unspoken dream, the chef who can taste memories crossed the drawbridge with salt on his boots. [58]  
He called himself Kilor, though names mattered less to him than flavors murmuring inside other people's tongues. [75]  
His commission was singular: to sandpaper rough memories from the garrisoned heart of General Sel, veteran ruler of this parched bastion. [96]  
Sel waited in a banquet hall whose tapestries dripped desert blossom water, the air still smelling of ozone and rust. [116]  
Between them stood the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes, retrieved weeks ago by expedition and now thawing slowly on sledged iron. [138]  
Its ragged walls glimmered with imprisoned sea-flowers, and every melt-drop rang like a pinched bell across the silent courtyard. [157]  
Kilor approached, knowing the pavilion stored remorse in each fossilized ripple, grief compressed by centuries of frost and forgotten tide. [177]  
To unlock the taste he would employ his oldest method, analyzing tidal pool formations sketched on the coral's interior like maps of lost throats. [201]  
General Sel steadied himself, aware the process was emotionally contagious through touch; one brush of palm could drown an army in borrowed sorrow. [224]  
Kilor bowed, then laid his fingers upon the coral gate, letting the melting brine subsume his own recollections until only Sel's remained. [246]  
Flavor flooded him: charred dates, gunpowder, and the metallic sweetness of a thousand issued orders never revoked. [263]  
Behind each taste lurked images of torch-lit trenches where young lieutenants waited for a dawn charge that never came because the sky forgot to blush. [288]  
Sel watched the chef's trembling jaw, sensing how his own regrets traveled across skin, and his voice rasped like dry parchment. [309]  
He whispered that no campaign had haunted him more than the defense of Ravin's Well, where he ordered the floodgates shut, trapping refugees outside. [333]  
Kilor tasted the moment: limestone dust, panicked sweat, children's bread still warm in pockets they never finished. [350]  
The memories scraped his throat like shards, yet his task remained—to sandpaper rough memories, smoothing edges until they ceased bleeding into the present. [373]  
He breathed onto the coral, mapping Sel's guilt against the pavilion's own long-frozen grief, looking for grooves where one might fill the other. [396]  
In that lattice of salt and echo he saw a pocket of hollow foam, perfect to house the general's most corrosive recollections. [418]  
With a sigh he pressed Sel's shaking hand to the niche; remorse flowed out like cold ink, and the coral glowed faintly, accepting the deposit. [443]  
Instantly, the emotional pressure in the hall lightened, yet Kilor staggered, for the extracted sorrow had clung to him in transit. [464]  
Sel caught him, their palms meeting, and through that contact the sorrow ricocheted back, proof that regret remained a feral taste unwilling to be caged. [489]  
Frightened, the general pulled away, but the contagion lingered, trickling up his arm like ants bearing coals. [506]  
Kilor realized a universe of remorse could not be removed, only redistributed, and he had merely taught it new paths. [526]  
The pavilion cracked, spilling vapor that smelled of shipwrecks, as though displeased by meddling tongues. [541]  
Sel barked for the guards, but Kilor lifted a steady hand, his voice rugged as a whetstone. [558]  
He declared that the pavilion demanded payment: a living echo to buffer its ancient grief, else it would unfreeze completely and drown the fortress in prehuman tides. [585]  
Sel, who had survived storms of steel, balked at water, yet the choice now perched brittle on his tongue. [604]  
Kilor offered himself instead, promising to stand vigil inside the coral until every bead of remorse faded into foam. [623]  
His motivation was no longer merely professional; he wished to sandpaper rough memories from the world, starting with his own hidden inventory. [645]  
Sel, shamed, nodded, and the guards stepped back as the chef walked into the pavilion's mouth, letting coral jaws seal behind him. [667]  
Rainwater hissed on the cooling shell, forming minute mirrors in which the fortress walls looked both sturdy brittle and suddenly skeletal. [688]  
Inside, Kilor closed his eyes and tasted only silence, a flavor like unmixed flour, blank and waiting. [705]  
He began to hum, low as tide under ice, hoping the note would churn the pavilion's remorse into music the desert wind might scatter. [729]  
Outside, Sel listened, taste of iron remains on his lips, uncertain whether the melody praised him or judged him. [748]  
Either way, the fortress after rain sighed, and for the first time since the siege of Ravin's Well, he breathed without armor. [770]
