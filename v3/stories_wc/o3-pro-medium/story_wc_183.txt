Gray fog curled like tired serpents around the abandoned carnival ship drifting in a foggy bay, and the vessel groaned with half-remembered music. [23]  
I stepped aboard, heart hammering a rhythm caught between panic and hope. [35]  
The gangplank snapped behind me, sealing me inside a mood of trapped freedom. [48]  
That oxymoron had followed me since childhood, ever since my brother and I were labeled the chimera twin discoverer by a newspaper too startled to choose plural. [75]  
He had vanished last winter, pursuing a rumor that this ship hid the path to find the garden of forgotten names. [96]  
I followed, clutching my only clue, an emerald swatch card whose shade matched the impossible eyes of the carnival's papier-mache sphinx. [117]  
The card warmed whenever I stepped in the right direction, like a compass forged from light and longing. [135]  
Tonight it pulsed so hot I thought it might burn a hole through my palm. [150]  
Calliope whispers drifted from the carousel, twisting into voices that invited me deeper, promising unkindled solace if I dared remember properly. [171]  
Solace without flame sounded wrong, yet my brother's research said the garden bloomed only where sorrow was gentle enough not to ignite. [193]  
Every corridor on the ship looped back, corridors painted with murals of crowds who never aged, their smiles blissfully aberrant and slightly smeared, as though time kept editing its own brushstrokes. [224]  
I feared I would join those murals if I hesitated. [234]  
So I followed the emerald glow down a stairwell where mirrors replaced steps, and every reflection showed me older or younger, as memories alter mid-breath. [259]  
The final mirror fractured, revealing the theater at the ship's core, curtains stitched from drowned ticket stubs. [276]  
There he stood, my twin, spotlighted by wan lanterns, weaving invisible yarn with both hands. [291]  
Narrative threads, he called them once, strands of story capable of sewing doors where walls insisted. [307]  
Now those threads swirled around him like tame comets, and each comet carried a name I had forgotten the moment our parents died. [330]  
He smiled, but the smile was taped together by fatigue. [340]  
"Help me recapture the ones that escaped," he whispered, and several threads snapped toward me, seeking fingerprints to anchor them. [360]  
I understood then that he had found the garden but could not leave, because every name he planted sprouted a fresh labyrinth. [382]  
He was gardener and prisoner, king and scarecrow. [390]  
Trapped freedom again, wearing his face. [396]  
I stepped forward, and the emerald swatch card flared, pouring green over the stage like dawn through stained glass. [415]  
The lingering audience of painted specters gasped, then dissolved into seedlike motes that drifted upward, searching for soil beyond the ceiling. [436]  
I asked him to come home, to rewrite our childhood without the accident, but he shook his head. [454]  
"Someone has to remember the lost, and memory is lighter in two bodies," he said, extending half the swirling comet yarn to me. [477]  
Accepting meant staying; refusing meant abandoning him to his blissfully aberrant throne. [489]  
So I chose a third line, sliding the yarn through narrative threads he had not noticed, stitching an exit only chimeric siblings could decode. [513]  
We walked side by side, pulling the new seam behind us, and the theater peeled open into a botanical corridor glowing with bioluminescent names. [537]  
They rustled like leaves made of syllables, thanking him for care and me for rescue. [552]  
Past the corridor, moonlight revealed a courtyard of blank headstones awaiting future letters. [565]  
The ship's hull cracked, and seawater surged in, but instead of drowning us it blossomed into lily pads of shimmering ink. [586]  
We stepped across them, each pad supporting only remembered weight, forcing us to keep telling our story aloud so the ink knew where to solidify. [611]  
Through that delicate bridge we left the carnival ship behind, watching it fold into mist like a chapter closing itself. [631]  
He asked if the garden would survive without its caretaker, and I told him gardens prefer wanderers to wardens. [650]  
The answer pleased him, though sadness lingered like distant calliope notes. [661]  
Together we watched dawn bleed across the bay, the first real sun we had shared since the accident. [679]  
Its light did not erase our sense of trapped freedom, but it widened the cage until walking felt like flight. [699]  
Ahead lay the shore and perhaps the garden's next gate; behind us stories repaired themselves, waiting for other seekers. [718]  
I tucked the emerald swatch card into my brother's pocket, and its warmth spread between us like a promise we would keep rewriting until it finally became true. [746]
