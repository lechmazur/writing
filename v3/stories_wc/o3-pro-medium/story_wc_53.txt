After the carousel halts, the fractured stillness settles like dust upon Marlo's shoulders. [13]
He is a resolute scavenger by trade, rummaging through abandoned wonders that cling to the stratosphere. [29]
Yet here, on the rim of a kinetic lagoon above the clouds, even his boots seem unsure of chronology. [48]
Time has snagged on the lagoon's churning eddies, leaving Marlo chronologically confused but painfully aware of his eroded ambitions. [67]
He once dreamed of mapping the secret hydraulics that kept such impossible water aloft; now he only regrets the rust on his notebooks. [90]
Regret, however, is a currency accepted by ghosts, and Marlo has come to negotiate with his own. [107]
Legend says a person can bargain for direction if they confront the echo of what they could have been. [126]
Marlo gathers clues the only way he trusts anymore, by collecting fragments of overheard stories that drift across the lagoon like gulls. [148]
Each fragment he pins inside his coat, where the yarn of tellers untangles into directions, warnings, and sometimes mournful jokes. [168]
Tonight's trove whispers of a disposable camera wheel lodged somewhere in the lagoon's orbit, still holding the last light painted by the living Marlo. [192]
If he can retrieve that wheel, the stories insist, the ghost may finally recognize him. [207]
Recognition is the first step of any negotiation, or so the broken philosophers say when their bottles are empty. [226]
Marlo steps onto a causeway of revolving lily pads, each pad spun by the lagoon's hidden currents, each rotation erasing several seconds from his memory. [251]
Chronologically confused or not, he marks progress by the tightening ache in his calves. [265]
Halfway across, the water beneath him accelerates, transforming quiet ripple into a miniature storm that slaps mist into the sky. [285]
Within the mist he hears voices, pieces of stories he never meant to steal: a child's giggle, a widow's sigh, a pilot cursing wind shear. [310]
He pockets them anyway, because that is what scavengers do when the world forgets to post guards. [327]
The final pad deposits him upon a pier made of carousel horses jammed nose-first into planks, their painted eyes revolving like compass needles. [350]
Here, fractured stillness deepens; the horses no longer move, yet their shadows gallop beneath the boards as if refusing the halt. [371]
At the pier's end hovers the disposable camera wheel, caught in a gauze of light that spins without sound. [390]
Marlo reaches, and the wheel breaks free, sending a pulse through the lagoon that feels like someone unshelving an overdue memory. [411]
Images flicker across the cloud ceiling: Marlo as a boy photographing thunderheads, Marlo older bargaining away maps for spare film, Marlo tonight wringing hours out of regret. [438]
From the carousel horses rises a silhouette shaped like him but hollow, its edges shimmering with the same sepia as the captured photographs. [461]
"We have unfinished exposures," the ghost murmurs, its voice spliced from every fragment Marlo ever pilfered. [477]
The lagoon calms, yet the sky reels, as if the roles of motion and rest cannot agree on chronology. [496]
Marlo offers the camera wheel, hands trembling with the magnitude of unprinted futures. [509]
"I want to negotiate," he says, voice barely louder than the hush between carousel songs. [524]
The ghost tilts its head, matching his posture with uncanny symmetry, and exposes a cavity where a heart would once tick. [545]
"Fill this, and I will guide you into days that have not yet spoiled," it intones. [561]
Marlo hesitates, for the only material he possesses in abundance is regret, and he fears contaminating the cavity with his own corrosion. [583]
But the lagoon begins to rotate again, faster this time, demanding a decision before chronology tears completely. [600]
Remembering the child's giggle he stole from the mist, he reaches into his coat and releases that sound into the ghost. [621]
The giggle spirals within the cavity, turning like the camera wheel, illuminating ribs with innocent echoes of beginnings. [639]
Next he surrenders the widow's sigh, which settles over the giggle like dew, giving shape to endings that know how to let go. [662]
Finally he plants the pilot's curse, a raw wind that stirs everything into motion, binding beginnings and endings with fearless turbulence. [683]
The ghost's cavity closes, and from its chest blossoms a strobing compass pointing toward paths Marlo has yet to erode. [703]
In that fractured stillness he understands the bargain: he may keep moving if he carries stories, not just steals them. [723]
The carousel horses beneath the pier lift their heads, and the entire structure begins to turn, reinvigorated by an unseen engine of reconciled timelines. [747]
Marlo steps onto a rising horse, clutching the camera wheel now glowing with shared memory, and the ride launches him across the lagoon toward dawn. [772]
Behind him the ghost waves, no longer hollow, and its voice merges with the carousel's revived tune, promising that this direction will hold until the next halt. [799]
