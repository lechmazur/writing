<story>The druid Inyara crouched at the rim of the cursed lake, cloak drawn tight against the warlike serenity of dawn. [20]  
She was guarded not by walls, but by silence, honed from years spent listening to trees remember battles. [38]  
Today she sought what mirrors refuse to show—a memory lost beyond reflections, waiting beneath swirling water. [54]  
But first she needed the orchard vortex hidden at the lake’s heart, and the seed it protected. [71]  
Her last attempt had ended after the magic trick failed, leaving her frozen in shame on the shore. [89]  
That failure, like a frozen confession, still ached behind her ribs, urging her to unbend and try again. [107]  
She touched the water, whispering the old pattern that summons circles within circles upon any still surface. [124]  
Ripples spread through expanding circles, each ring glowing green, guiding her path like mossy stepping stones. [140]  
She stepped onto the first, and the lake accepted her weight, solid as orchard soil in spring. [157]  
Around her, skeins of mist twisted into branches laden with spectral fruit, spinning a corridor toward the vortex. [175]  
The spectacle might have startled any traveler, yet Inyara could find lost things; wonder was her compass. [192]  
She remembered finding a king’s sigh in a broken lute, a child’s laugh at the bottom of a well. [211]  
Those triumphs steadied her now as the mist corridor thickened and the lake beneath roared with hidden teeth. [229]  
At the corridor’s end waited the swirling orchard vortex, roots and waters coiling together like two armies embracing. [247]  
Unripe apples spun through the air, their skins etched with runic thorns that glinted hungrily. [262]  
In the vortex’s eye floated a single ivory pod—the flesh-eating plant seed she sought. [276]  
Legends claimed it could devour lies as easily as meat, and within its husk hid truths unswallowed by light. [295]  
Yet the seed never revealed itself until someone proved the courage to face what no mirror reflects. [312]  
Inyara inhaled, feeling her guarded heart thud like a drumline for a coming war. [326]  
She spoke to the apples, acknowledging their threat, praising their vigilance, promising she would bleed only honesty upon entry. [345]  
The thorns dimmed, granting passage, and the rippling rings spread wider, stairs formed of pale water and dusk. [363]  
Step by step she descended, mind emptying of chatter, filling instead with the lake’s martial calm. [379]  
At the final stair she found a mirror of ice, blocking the pod, flawless except for a faint pulse. [398]  
It held her reflection frozen mid-breath, mouth open, as though her earlier failure still commanded time. [414]  
The frozen confession materialized: she had once abandoned her sister to save seedlings from fire, choosing trees over blood. [433]  
Memory wracked her, and the mirror thickened, hungry for self-punishment. [443]  
But Inyara had come to unbend, not to break. [452]  
She knelt, palms outward, tracing expanding circles on the ice as she had on the lake. [468]  
With each circle she named a truth lost when she caged her guilt: sister’s laughter, ash scent, night rain. [487]  
Words became petals, drifting into the mirror, thawing its surface like spring sunlight on a battlefield’s frost. [504]  
Cracks spidered, and water rushed out, carrying the confession into the lake’s deeper memory where lost things belong. [522]  
The ice collapsed, revealing the seed, which drifted into her hands as gently as a surrendering sword. [539]  
Its surface unfurled like a pale blossom, showing a vision no mirror could hold. [553]  
She saw her sister alive within a distant grove, roots bandaged around burned legs, still singing to saplings. [571]  
Hope, once lost, returned through the expanding circles of unbent will. [582]  
Holding the seed, Inyara rose, her posture straight but not rigid, like a bow loosened after battle. [599]  
The lake calmed, yet the orchard continued to whirl, escorting her homeward along new, widening rings. [615]  
She departed with warlike serenity in her step, carrying a future that mirrors would never dare confess. [632]</story>
