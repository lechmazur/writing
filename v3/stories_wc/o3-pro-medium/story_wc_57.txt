An oceanic hush swallowed the world the morning I reached the golden dock under snow. [15]  
Mist blurred mastheads, and gulls stitched pale circles in the sky as fog rolls across the harbor. [32]  
I am Sera, a philosophical seed collector, and my satchels clinked with sleeping harvests from forgotten orchards. [49]  
The journey had carried me here not for trade, but to preserve ancient methods whispered only by riverbanks. [67]  
Some said those methods were tended by the secret weavers, creatures or people no tale could decide. [84]  
Others swore the weavers were merely winds blowing patterns through reeds, yet I followed every rumor. [100]  
I believed patience could coax truth out of silence the way sun draws green from a buried bean. [118]  
So I waited, infinitely patient, leaning against a bollard glimmering with frost. [130]  
A fisherman in a crimson parka hauled a coil of rope nearby, its knots elaborate as constellations. [147]  
When he noticed my gaze, he smiled with chipped teeth and said the rope spoke better than he could. [166]  
His words rang like a bell inside me, for legend claimed the secret weavers left messages in mariners' lines. [185]  
I asked permission to study the cord, and he shrugged, glad for pause from the cold labor. [202]  
Kneeling, I traced the twists, remembering an old primer that taught speech by decoding knot patterns in a fisherman's rope. [222]  
The primer's ink had faded, yet muscle memory guided my fingers over hitches, bends, and splices. [238]  
A hidden grammar emerged: crossings for vowels, loops for breaths, tension for emphasis. [251]  
The rope said, 'Turn east beyond the breakwater, where lightning chiseled glass from sand'. [265]  
Fulgurite glass, I realized, forged when storms drive fire into beaches, might be the relic the weavers prized. [283]  
I thanked the fisherman, tucked three apple seeds in his palm, and promised they would sprout crimson as his coat. [303]  
He laughed, a foghorn in miniature, and returned to stacking crates while I boarded my modest skiff. [320]  
Snowflakes drifted like stray feathers, yet the water remained black and calm, reflective as obsidian. [335]  
My oars dipped soundlessly, and the harbor's mouth opened onto gray swells that smelled of iron and sage. [353]  
Even miles out, I felt the golden dock under snow pulling at my thoughts like a lodestone, urging me not to forget the beginning. [377]  
After two hours, the sky cracked with a distant rumble, and an ivory flash speared the dune ahead. [395]  
Steam rose where lightning had struck, and when I stepped ashore the sand was still glassy warm. [412]  
I followed a trail of vitrified tubes, hollow roots of frozen thunder, until they converged around a shallow pit. [431]  
Inside, woven from cattail fibers and moon-snail threads, lay a small cradle cradling nothing but possibility. [447]  
I understood then that the secret weavers were not guardians of objects, but of instructions. [462]  
Their looms were storms, their shuttles sand, their message a silent order for the patient to fulfill. [479]  
Drawing the longest fulgurite glass tube free, I tapped it and heard a faint seedpod rattle within. [496]  
Lightning had sealed the pod inside a mineral shell, preserving its code until someone could read the knots of the sky. [517]  
I pressed the tube to my ear and promised, in the hush between breakers, that I would sow it when the world was ready. [541]  
The pledge felt like germination itself, tiny roots gripping my ribs. [552]  
Night drifted down, but the fulgurite glowed softly, guiding me back to the skiff. [566]  
I rowed toward the harbor lights, trusting the fisherman's rope to tangle another traveler once my task began. [584]  
Some wisdom grows only by relay, hand to knot, knot to storm, storm to seed, seed to soil. [602]  
I, infinitely patient, would guard that chain until the cradle inside the earth rocked open. [617]  
And when it did, perhaps the golden dock under snow would bloom, and everyone would hear the secret weavers without ropes or storms. [640]  
Until that season, the oceanic hush inside my ribcage will remind me why I listened at all. [657]  
For every answer worth sowing begins as fog rolls across the harbor, unreadable to haste yet clear to the patient. [677]
