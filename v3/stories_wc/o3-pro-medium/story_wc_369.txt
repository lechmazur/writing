Silver rain lashed the stormlit tower by moonlight, yet the labyrinth below still demanded its nightly upkeep. [17]  
Eron, senior labyrinth maintenance worker, trudged down the spiral stairs with a mop, a toolbox, and an astronomer's broken sextant. [37]  
The sextant's brass arc was cracked, its mirrors cloudy, but Eron carried it like a relic salvaged from drowning stars. [57]  
He had promised the tower's long-dead astronomer to mend it once quantified sorrow stopped distorting its readings of heaven. [76]  
Quantified sorrow was the labyrinth's secret fuel, measured in glimmering droplets that seeped from visitors' footprints and settled into gutters. [96]  
Eron knew every coil of the maze, yet he knew almost nothing about the moonlit orchard of ancient trees above the roof. [118]  
What do trees witness when storms scrape stars, he wondered, and that question tugged him through corridors more surely than any duty. [140]  
Tonight he meant to discover the answer, even if it required dismantling the very labyrinth he maintained. [157]  
First he paused at the threshold where torches always sputtered out, listening for the pinpoint silence that signaled shifting passageways. [177]  
A pin fell somewhere deep, striking stone with the faintest tick, and in that moment a pin was heard in a silent corridor. [200]  
Passages froze, walls stopped breathing, and the maze allowed him one brittle chance to walk unhindered. [216]  
He stepped forward, ankle aching from yesterday's fall, trusting that the pain would heal in moonlight once roofs peeled away overhead. [237]  
The sextant rattled inside his satchel like a caged thunderclap, reminding him that sorrow still haunted its fractured spine. [256]  
To release that sorrow he intended to deconstruct the labyrinth's memory vaults by mapping scattered dreams gathered from every visitor. [276]  
He fetched chalk from his toolbox and began sketching imperfect constellations across the flagstones, each based on a dream he had once swept away. [300]  
There was the falcon of unfinished letters, the whale of lost names, the tree whose roots clutched forgotten lullabies. [319]  
Lines glimmered with runoff sorrow, and when the patterns closed, the floor opened like a gently sighing book. [337]  
Eron descended into a chamber no custodian's map acknowledged, its ceiling woven from moonlit branches that seemed to be dreaming of daylight. [359]  
Actual trees stood here, impossibly alive beneath masonry, their trunks opening into knot-hole eyes that regarded him with weathered patience. [379]  
He bowed, aware that his own heartbeat thumped like a broom against cathedral pews, and offered the broken sextant across his palms. [401]  
The oldest tree, cedar-barked and lightning-scarred, reached a twig to the instrument as though tasting starlight residue. [418]  
Sap touched brass, and sorrow crystals hiding in the hinge flickered into numbers, the first successful attempt at quantified sorrow since the tower's construction. [442]  
Eron watched columns of digits whirl above the sextant, each numeral damp with grief yet gleaming with possibility. [460]  
The trees murmured in rings of wind, and he understood they were showing him what they had witnessed. [478]  
Storms, migrations, lovers carving initials, executioners sharpening axes, children releasing kites, centuries of ordinary miracles layered like bark. [496]  
He realized the labyrinth had hoarded sorrow because no one had ever bothered to ask trees how to release it kindly. [517]  
At the cedar's urging, he placed the sextant upon a stump that glowed where moonbeams slipped through cracked stone. [536]  
Little by little the brass regrew, mirrors cleared, and sorrow converted into a cool vapor that drifted up toward the orchard's leaves. [558]  
The vapor condensed upon needles and buds, mending storm scars, so the trees themselves healed in moonlight alongside Eron's tender ankle. [579]  
When the final droplet lifted, the labyrinth above rearranged with a sigh, corridors straightening as though exhaling centuries of convoluted grief. [600]  
Eron climbed back through the open floor and found the path to the orchard now a simple stairway cut in fresh stone. [622]  
He locked the maze's service gate and set his mop aside, because there were dew-soaked constellations to chart and no sorrow left to clean. [646]  
Taking the restored sextant, he stepped onto the tower balcony where clouds parted, and he aimed the instrument at the orchard canopy. [668]  
Starlight bounced through its mirrors, reflected again from glistening leaves, and mapped a sky only trees could see; finally, Eron witnessed with them. [691]  
He laughed at how mundane miracles merely require good maintenance and the right moment to hear a falling pin in silence. [712]  
Far below, the labyrinth glistened clean and straight, ready for tomorrow's footsteps, but tonight the maintenance worker and the trees shared the same horizon. [736]
