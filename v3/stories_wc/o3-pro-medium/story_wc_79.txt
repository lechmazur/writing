My name is Corin Rells, spiral-shell cartographer of the Chelonic League, and the sun has never felt heavier than today. [20]  
I stand on Balcony Twelve of Shellward City, a city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles drifting across the inland sea. [42]  
The streets below glow with salt-pale sunlight, yet a hush clings to the tiles like damp linen, a sunwashed dread we pretend is breeze. [66]  
Everything changed after the gate rusts shut, sealing the harbor arch where the turtles once crawled to molt. [84]  
With that final clang, the city realized our explorers had not returned, and the expedition was officially declared lost. [103]  
I was quietly driven before, mapping spiral growth on living carapace, but mourning has sharpened my compass into a spike. [123]  
I must follow the route of the lost expedition, not to rescue them, but to question the silent watchers on the horizon who stared as they vanished. [150]  
The watchers look like spearpoints of glass at dusk, unmoving, perhaps statues, perhaps witnesses, perhaps the last audience my cartography will meet. [172]  
To reach them, I must descend through the labyrinthine scutes where the turtles overlap, reading currents and fault lines like letters. [193]  
Navigation is only possible through pattern languages, the colored inlays older cartographers hammered into keratin centuries ago to describe tides of meat and stone. [217]  
I trace the amber triangles that mean 'descend', the cobalt spirals for 'hollow', and the vermilion dots warning of fracture. [237]  
Each mark glows faintly when sunlight hits, as though the turtles themselves remember the language and offer approval. [255]  
I carry little: a reed whistle to call seamoths for ferry rides, two ink coils, and the cracked sextant of my mentor, Elyth. [278]  
She led the lost expedition, so her instrument now feels like both a map and a wound. [295]  
Rumor says the watchers sounded a single note when Elyth's crew approached, a note that made every hinge in their armor crack open. [318]  
City scholars call it myth, but I have dreamed that note every night since the gate closed, and I believe dreams plot truer courses than rumor. [344]  
At dawn I step onto the lower scute, where barnacle towers shimmer like broken obelisks. [359]  
Here the pattern language flickers into gaps, as if someone tried to erase directions, and I feel the absence like hunger. [380]  
I unroll one of Elyth's secret charts, drawn in milk-ink only visible under turtle-light, and overlay it on the shells. [400]  
Lines converge toward the horizon watchers, describing a geometry of refusals, loops that almost touch but never merge. [418]  
I whistle a mournful chord, and a seamoth surfaces, its fins translucent like stained glass underwater. [434]  
We glide across the caramel shallows while noon pours molten light on the turtles' backs, baking algae into incense. [453]  
Closer to the horizon, the watchers grow distinct: thirteen basalt figures, each holding a mirror of polished shell that never flashes. [474]  
Elyth's notes say they spoke through reflection, a pattern language of light, but only if approached without weapons or certainty. [494]  
I leave the sextant behind on the seamoth's seat; even brass ambition might look like a blade to stone prophets. [514]  
As I step onto their platform of fused sand, the reed whistle hangs at my neck like a promised apology. [534]  
Sunlight ricochets off the mirrors into my eyes, arranging dots and lines; I realize they are writing questions across my retinas. [555]  
I answer through pattern languages I learned from shells, moving my hands in spirals that mean 'seeker', 'alone', and 'why'. [575]  
Their mirrors tilt; a single beam touches the reed whistle, heating it until sap crystals inside begin to crack and sing the forbidden note. [599]  
The air quivers, the turtles shudder, and in that vibration I sense Elyth's final coordinates, a place beneath the plastron called the Listening Vault. [623]  
Grief surges forward, but the mirrors flash again, telling me the expedition is neither alive nor dead, only waiting for the right question. [646]  
I breathe harsh salt, steady my hands, and let the sun write across my palms: 'show me the road'. [665]  
In reply they angle their mirrors seawards, projecting a spiral of light down through the translucence of the turtles, illuminating arteries of bone-cooled water. [689]  
The path is impossible for armies or machines, but perfect for one quietly driven cartographer bearing only ink and longing. [709]  
I bow, feel sunlight burn answers onto my scalp, and know I will go below, even if every hinge in my own soul must crack open too. [736]  
The seamoth circles, impatient, but I spare one glance back at Shellward City gleaming above like a fragile map drawn on moving flesh. [759]  
If I return, the gate will have to open, but gates are only doors in metal; questions are doors in light, and they never rust. [784]</story>
