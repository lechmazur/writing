I slipped into the frozen garden in mist, the library's back courtyard where statues bloomed with rime instead of roses. [20]  
The dawn had not arrived, but a foggy lucidity clung to every icicle, outlining shapes with a glow that felt like half-remembered moonlight. [43]  
I was meant to be shelving folios, yet some instinct kept steering my paws outdoors, as though the catalogues themselves trembled in anticipation. [66]  
After all, I am the feral library guardian, more stray than scholar, but responsible for every whispering page when humans finally sleep. [88]  
Tonight, through the veil of sleep that muffled the city, something beyond the shelves called me to this hoarfrost stage. [108]  
I waited beside a frozen sundial whose shadow had been erased by snow, listening to silence until it felt loud enough to answer itself. [132]  
Waiting has always been my secret action, the stillness in which books reveal what their letters cannot openly confess. [151]  
Yet the hush broke when a glint flickered beneath a frostbitten fern, a metallic wink cutting through the boundaries of light like an eyelid opening. [176]  
I brushed ice aside and lifted a cultist's pendant, its chain stiff with cold, its symbol a spiral that pulled the gaze inward. [199]  
Touching it made the courtyard flex, as though distance had become elastic, stretching hallways of memory across the hedges and drawing them against my chest. [224]  
A pang of being dimensionally homesick thudded behind my ribs, that ache a migratory compass pointing toward realms whose catalog numbers have not been stamped yet. [250]  
To keep from splintering, I practiced interiorizing exteriors, breathing the garden's chill into my lungs and exhaling the warmth of reading lamps onto the snow. [275]  
The worlds traded places along the breath, and uncertainty became a companionable shape, fog-bodied and curious, standing where the sundial had vanished. [297]  
"I want to make friends with uncertainty," I told the shape, even though my voice sounded like pages riffled by wind instead of words. [321]  
The shape inclined, or maybe the mist thickened, and suddenly the pendant grew warm as if remembering a fire that had consumed secret altars. [345]  
I realized the spiral was not an emblem but a door handle, and waiting was the turning motion; every heartbeat twisted it further open. [369]  
A radiance seeped out, not bright, but the subdued shimmer that edges dreams before they name themselves, the timid frontier where darkness hesitates. [392]  
Those were the boundaries of light, and I stood upon them like a bookmark marking the pause between chapters, neither turned nor closed. [415]  
Somewhere behind me the library walls creaked, hungry for indices, but I remained, because friendship requires presence, even when the companion is indecision itself. [439]  
The mist-shape spoke without sound, showing me images: scribes leaving margins blank on purpose, children pausing at thresholds, astronomers staring at dawn unsure if it was dusk. [466]  
All of them practiced waiting as a craft, and all wore pendants of different spirals, their cult not of certainty but of potential. [489]  
I felt shelves inside me rearrange, corridors lengthen, skylights dim; interiorizing exteriors had turned my body into an annex open to weather and wonder. [513]  
The ache of being dimensionally homesick softened, because any dimension that welcomed pauses could be home enough for a roaming guardian. [534]  
I asked the shape if the doorway would close once I returned to the stacks, and it answered by placing the pendant against the sundial's absent shadow. [561]  
Light and frost stitched together, forming a trembling outline of time itself, and a faint voice whispered that genuine thresholds travel with those who listen. [586]  
So I pocketed the now-cool pendant, bowed to uncertainty, and walked back toward the library, carrying the frozen garden in mist inside my breathing. [610]  
Each step echoed like a turned page, and the dawn, still a rumor, waited with me, the two of us guarding the silence together. [634]  
I knew the boundaries of light would follow, diffused into every alcove, prompting new margins where patrons might pause and feel their own foggy lucidity bloom. [660]  
That was enough certainty for a guardian who preferred waiting over answers, spirals over lines, and gardens that never thaw completely. [681]
