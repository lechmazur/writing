Silva Threnody was known among the desert canyons as the canyon echo singer, her low notes bouncing like orphan ghosts between stone walls. [23]  
Travelers gathered at dusk, hoping to hear how her voice twined with wind into a melody that left the sand vibrating long after silence returned. [48]  
Yet Silva never sang for applause; she performed to read the echoes themselves, for she was richly perceptive to stories hidden in returning sound. [72]  
Every rebound carried fractured rumors, as though the canyon walls wove webs of intrigue from whispered secrets shed by passing caravans. [93]  
One evening an aged merchant pressed into her palm a cracked ivory curve, calling it a whispering seashell half and begging her to keep it close. [119]  
He claimed it once belonged to his twin who vanished in the dunes, leaving only the other half blinking with faint phosphorescence when starlight struck. [144]  
Silva pressed the shell to her ear and heard not ocean roar but a careful voice counting down from ten as if rehearsing courage. [168]  
The merchant vanished before dawn, and the shell's countdown began again, one digit lower, persuading her that time, rather than numbers, was being measured. [192]  
Disturbed, she left the familiar gorge and followed the shell's pulse across moon-bleached flats until cliffs knotted into a serpentine nexus under starlight. [215]  
There the air quivered with harmonics too quiet for ordinary travelers, yet Silva sensed them the way night animals scent distant springs. [237]  
She recognized the place from half-remembered lullabies that spoke of doors opening only while the universe hums its secret song. [257]  
The countdown reached zero, the shell warmed, and a fissure split the canyon floor, revealing steps that spiraled downward like a flute's carved interior. [281]  
Driven by her motive to learn why some people echo, she descended, singing one sustained note to test the path. [301]  
The walls responded, overlapping her voice with others: a child's laugh, a warrior's oath, the trembling farewell of the merchant's vanished twin. [323]  
Each reflection arrived slightly before her own timbre faded, a violation of physics that confirmed consciousness was stored here like dust in crevices. [346]  
Silva realized that echoes were not merely sounds returning but memories seeking mouths to retell them. [362]  
Some people, blessed or cursed, had bones tuned to receive these stray remembrances, and so their speech rang with voices not their own. [385]  
That was why the merchant's twin faded, why caravans whispered, and why Silva herself feared her throat was becoming a communal well. [407]  
To ensure she kept agency, she needed to negotiate with whatever intelligence nested below. [421]  
The stairwell ended in a chamber shaped like overlapping petals, each petal a polished slab that shimmered faintly when she breathed. [442]  
Voices tensed in the air, awaiting her first word, and she spoke through progressive disclosure, unveiling her purpose layer by careful layer. [464]  
She admitted the shell guided her, confessed her dread of losing herself, and offered her vocation as mediator between stone memory and living mind. [488]  
In answer, the slabs vibrated, knitting sound into luminous threads that hovered like a loom of moonlit cobweb. [506]  
Images wove across the threads: broken instruments, lost travelers, and finally Silva herself standing above the canyon mouth, her voice turning to mist. [529]  
The intelligence offered a pact in stillness rather than speech, but she understood it by the ache in her sternum. [549]  
The canyon echo singer would carry chosen memories to the surface, releasing them as song so they could dissipate instead of haunting the catacombs. [573]  
In return the depths promised to cease hijacking random throats, giving those above freedom from involuntary resonance. [590]  
Silva accepted, though reed-blown melancholy fluttered through her ribs at the price: every performance would now end with memories that were none of her own. [615]  
She ascended carrying the quiet loom of threads inside her lungs, and at the canyon rim dawn was smudging the stars. [636]  
Her first post-pact note drifted upward, half grief, half release, and the walls answered not with stolen voices but with a single, grateful silence. [660]  
Somewhere beneath, the secret chamber sighed, the countdown reset, and the shell cooled against her heart like a promise kept. [680]
