Liora Cane stepped barefoot onto the velvet observatory at midsummer, inhaling dust that smelled of stars. [16]  
Officially, she was the museum's senior provenance researcher, hunter of origins and forgotten signatures. [30]  
Unofficially, the roses climbing the western dome whispered their thorns-and-all opinions straight into her skull. [45]  
She had been accidentally telepathic with plants since a greenhouse lightning storm in childhood. [59]  
In the lotus-skein hush of the observatory, their murmurs wove a constant, opinionated counterpoint. [73]  
Tonight, her motive outshone curiosity: to weigh a dream against an empire. [85]  
The dream belonged to Solon Reign, last violinist of the glacial courts, now erased. [99]  
All records said his masterpiece, a transparent violin made of ice crystal, had melted with him. [115]  
Yet the empire's new anthem claimed motifs only that instrument could voice, frost-bright and brittle. [130]  
Where had they hidden the violin, and at what cost to its creator's memory? [144]  
Liora aimed to find it before the promise loses its glow, as Solon had once pleaded in coded letters. [163]  
But proofs scarce as midnight pollen required stranger tools than ledgers and lyceum registries. [177]  
Therefore she unfolded her chipped tin kettle, brewed pitch-dark coffee, and let the drips freestyle across porcelain. [194]  
Reading the future in coffee stains was frowned upon by the archivists but adored by begonias. [210]  
The saucer spiraled sepia runes spelling: propagate, corridor seven, midnight minus two. [222]  
Corridor seven plunged beneath the observatory, past velvet walls that muffled every footfall like heavy snow. [238]  
The roses hummed caution, their scent turning peppery with fear, yet Liora pressed on. [252]  
Her pulse throbbed a mulberry ache, half grief, half anticipation, wholly hers. [264]  
At the corridor's terminus waited a door of perforated destiny, bronze punched with random constellations. [279]  
Through each hole seeped moonlike vapor, hinting that fate itself had been aerated for easier breathing. [295]  
Liora traced a familiar star, the Weaver, and the panel sighed open like a tired chest. [311]  
Inside, cold radiance ignited shards of something propped on a pedestal of black peat moss. [326]  
The transparent violin made of ice crystal stood unbowed, humming softly, neither melting nor fully solid. [342]  
Its music, unheard by ears, blasted straight into the ivy roots coiled beneath the moss bed. [358]  
They greeted Liora: We remember frost kingdoms; coax us and we shall remember louder. [372]  
She understood the plant-chorus, her secret shame and gift, and felt the walls listen too. [387]  
Somewhere above, the empire's anthem echoed from parade loudhailers, bright as sunlight on broken glass. [402]  
That brightness imposed amnesia, replacing Solon's dream with triumphant brass, and Liora's lungs tightened. [416]  
She lifted the violin; ice crystals chimed, petals of sound flaking onto the peat. [430]  
The ivy asked what she desired to propagate, root to root, leaf to leaf. [444]  
She answered with a silent chord, the contour of a promise still glowing on Solon's last envelope. [461]  
Roots absorbed the music like ink, and perforations in the bronze door widened, exhaling misty archives. [477]  
Across the city, every garden trembled as the underground network carried the chord upward. [491]  
Balconies of geraniums shuddered, street poplars clacked their hollow trunks, and window-box mint exhaled crystallized melodies. [507]  
Crowds paused, hearing not brass but the ghost of ice vibrating through chlorophyll and stone alike. [523]  
Empire banners wilted as creeping vines found new footholds, perforating fabric the way destiny was perforated downstairs. [540]  
Liora feared collapse, yet the violin remained cold and whole, its transparency inviting rather than withholding. [556]  
She realized the instrument was never meant for performance halls but for botanical conduits, nature's hidden auditoriums. [573]  
Solon had designed it to let the earth itself remember his melodies after kings forgot. [588]  
The empire had stolen the violin, sampling fragments for an anthem, then locked it away to melt quietly. [606]  
Their accountants miscalculated ice that refuses integers, and destiny leaked through every fiscal perforation. [620]  
Now the chord kept rising, passed from petunia to cedar, until even palace laurels trembled with recollection. [637]  
Liora lowered the violin onto the peat, trusting the moss to guard its slow, perpetual resonance. [653]  
She returned upstairs as dawn bled mauve, feeling the mulberry ache soften into tentative plum hope. [669]  
Outside, citizens listened to gardens singing the lost concerto, and an empire began remembering whose dream it had trampled. [688]  
In that remembering, Liora heard a promise regain its glow, and destiny, though perforated, finally breathed true. [705]
