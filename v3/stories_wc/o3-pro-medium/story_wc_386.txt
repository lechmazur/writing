Mara Nivens had never feared the hush beneath icebound hulls. [10]  
She was a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, speaking with echoes trapped in splintered steel. [23]  
Years among drowned corridors taught her to weave truth carefully from rusted lies. [36]  
Tonight she surfaced beside the Glacier of Bells, breath shimmering like borrowed starlight. [49]  
Above her, monks chipped a narrow stair into the blue wall of ice. [62]  
They guided her to a candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice, fragrant with resinous smoke. [77]  
Petals frozen mid-fall decorated alcoves, turning every flicker into a trembling constellation. [89]  
The monks had requested her because their prayers returned only silence and soft dripping. [103]  
Something restless prowled the glacier, they said, something yearning for a voice. [115]  
Mara unpacked the melted snow globe she had lifted from the wreck of the freighter Lumen. [131]  
Inside the warped glass, glitter floated in tepid water, drifting around a miniature lighthouse. [145]  
It seemed trivial, yet the object hummed with unfinished memory, one of several windows of connection. [161]  
She placed the globe on an ice pedestal and let its watery light refract across candles. [177]  
Meditation began not with chanting, but with sleep. [185]  
The monks reclined against fur rolls, trusting Mara to navigate their open dreaming. [198]  
Her own eyes closed, and the shrine's darkness turned inward, becoming a theatre of borrowed stars. [214]  
She drifted among their visions like a quiet seamstress, stitching the shards she found. [228]  
By analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, she could chart currents of haunting. [241]  
Tonight every dream held a recurring figure: a lighthouse keeper with frostbitten hands. [254]  
He knocked upon invisible glass, pleading to be seen before the sea returned. [267]  
Mara followed him through those flickering rooms until she recognized the perspective. [279]  
They were the inner chambers of the snow globe, now melted and distorted. [292]  
The keeper was the final soul of the Lumen, still watching for ships that would never arrive. [309]  
He had tended the miniature beacon in real life, then crafted replicas for tourists. [323]  
When the freighter sank, one snow globe cracked against his chest, fusing glass, ice, and memory. [339]  
Mara sensed his purpose: to salvage something pure from the wreckage, a single unbroken light. [354]  
Yet the glacier absorbed his signal, turning windows of connection into mirrors of loneliness. [368]  
She knew what she must expose. [374]  
In waking life, the monks venerated the glacier as flawless, ignoring the wreckage entombed within. [389]  
Their denial chained the keeper more tightly than steel. [398]  
Mara surfaced from trance, breath fogging the shrine, and spoke before the monks could stir. [413]  
Your glacier is a tomb wearing a halo, she said, hands on the melted globe. [428]  
Within it a keeper waits, beacon extinguished by your polished legends. [439]  
Let the truth breathe, and his light will rise for all of us. [452]  
Some monks recoiled, fearing desecration; others felt the glacier tremor as if listening. [465]  
Mara lifted the snow globe, its water now swirling with faint radiance. [477]  
Place this in the courtyard, she instructed; let pilgrims see the frailty inside beauty. [491]  
Reluctantly, they agreed, carrying the fragile sphere through tunnels that sighed with thawing air. [505]  
As the snow globe met moonlight, Mara returned to the shrine for one final vigil. [520]  
The candles guttered low, but their reflections danced high overhead, like signals passed along ice. [535]  
Suddenly the glacier walls grew translucent, revealing corridors of trapped air blinking with memory. [549]  
Each pocket became one of many windows of connection, glass upon glass, soul upon soul. [564]  
At their center stood the lighthouse keeper, hands warm, lantern blazing like first dawn. [578]  
He bowed to Mara, then strode toward an opening horizon of aurora and sea-spray. [592]  
His departure loosened the frozen petals, which tumbled through the shrine as gentle rain. [606]  
Monks entered, awestruck, witnessing the glacier cry and glitter simultaneously. [616]  
Mara said nothing; she only listened to the runoff, gauging whether the silence felt lighter. [631]  
For the first time, it sounded like space instead of absence. [642]  
She smiled, her motive fulfilled, knowing even wrecks could birth hymns if truth were given room. [658]  
Outside, pilgrims gathered around the globe, exposed to its delicate storm, each seeing themselves reflected in drifting glitter. [676]  
In their widened eyes Mara glimpsed new cameo dreams already forming, bright pathways she would one day map. [694]  
For now, she extinguished the last candle and stepped into the night, carrying only borrowed starlight. [710]
