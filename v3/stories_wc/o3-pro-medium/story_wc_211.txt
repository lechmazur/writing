The foghorn fell silent at dawn, and the city held its breath. [12]  
High above the smothered streets, an ancient orchard garden spread across the glassy crown of Calyx Tower. [29]  
Among twisted quince and quietly rusting irrigation pipes walked Loranth, the venerable oath scribe. [43]  
He had awakened earlier than usual, compelled by a glinting sliver beside his brass desk. [58]  
It was a wax cylinder phonograph shaving, curled like a fingernail yet singing with grooves of forgotten voice. [76]  
The shaving should have been locked downstairs in the phonotheque, but Loranth, sworn to archive emotional patterns, recognized its urgency. [96]  
He speaks dead languages as easily as breathing, and sound, to him, is merely script that floats. [113]  
When he placed the shaving against the stylus, a tremor of velvet disquiet passed through the leaves. [130]  
A voice rasped out a tongue lost since the basalt kingdoms, predicting rain of glass and rivers burning backward. [149]  
Loranth transcribed the utterance in scarlet ink, half listening, half remembering. [160]  
The shaving's cadence nudged open a door he had bolted for decades via a curious third-grade field trip memory. [179]  
He saw himself as a lanky child riding a rattling elevator to this very roof, following a teacher in a canary scarf. [201]  
Back then the orchard had seemed impossible, pears dangling where thunderclouds should be, and the experience had soaked into him like warm dye. [224]  
Now, after the foghorn falls silent, that same boyish awe returned, tinged with the prophecy the shaving chanted. [242]  
He realized the voice referred not to apocalypse but to the orchard itself, to its sap running with orphaned emotions. [262]  
Someone long ago had immersed grief and wonder into these trees, and the grooves merely replayed that buried storm. [281]  
His task, he knew, was to archive the orchard's emotional patterns before the branches split under their invisible weight. [300]  
Yet something in the prophecy twisted like ivy around his resolve. [311]  
This had been an accidental prophecy, born not from deliberate augury but from a misfiled shaving swept up by last night's wind. [333]  
If chance could conjure doom, chance might also undo it. [343]  
He pocketed the shaving, took a ladder, and descended to the irrigation cistern hidden beneath the pear roots. [361]  
Down there, the air tasted of copper pennies and moldy parchment. [372]  
He slid the cistern lid aside and felt warm mist rise, inviting him to immerse his hands. [389]  
Liquid memory glowed beneath, neither water nor sap but a distillation of every laugh and sigh ever breathed here. [408]  
He whispered words from a dead alphabet, each syllable a key that unfastened the orchard's aching heart. [425]  
The mist condensed into spinning discs, miniature wax cylinders awaiting inscription. [436]  
But the grooves remained blank until another memory surfaced, again via that curious third-grade field trip. [452]  
He recalled the teacher pointing at a single sickly apple and telling the children it would outlive them all. [471]  
Loranth had laughed then, but now the apple dangled overhead, shriveled yet stubborn, resonating with a low hum. [489]  
He reached up, plucked it, and pressed its brittle skin to the stylus of his portable recorder. [506]  
A tremolo of children's laughter erupted, looped backwards, resolving at last into a single clear instruction. [522]  
Plant the apple core where the foghorn once stood, the message said, and the city will remember joy before fear. [542]  
He hesitated, sensing that archiving emotion sometimes meant releasing it, not shelving it. [555]  
Outside the cistern, dawn light sliced through the lattice of branches like new parchment under a blade. [572]  
He climbed back up, apple core in pocket, every step echoing with that velvet disquiet. [587]  
The roof door swung open, and the muted city lay beneath, awaiting its first siren of the day. [605]  
He crossed the orchard to the parapet where the old foghorn sat like a rusted tusk. [621]  
Years of salt air had eaten holes in its bell, and no ship trusted it anymore. [637]  
Loranth knelt, digging with a pruning knife until the rooftop soil crumbled open. [650]  
He planted the withered core, covered it, and set the wax shaving like a silver mulch atop the mound. [669]  
For a moment nothing moved, but then the grooves on the shaving caught the breeze and whispered. [686]  
The sound was neither cry nor song, more the exhale of a relieved library. [700]  
Below, traffic lights flickered from red to amber, and strangers felt unaccountably lighter, though none knew why. [717]  
The accidental prophecy had resolved itself into a gentle revision, archived not on paper but in living streets. [735]  
Satisfied, the venerable oath scribe turned back toward the orchard, ready to begin a new ledger in the tongue of dawn. [756]
