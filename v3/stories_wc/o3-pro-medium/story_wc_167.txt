Pearl Bay exhaled a silver breath as dawn stretched over the sleeping boats and damp wharves. [16]  
Mira, the reflective harbor glazier, stepped onto the pier, her pockets clinking with shards of yesterday's broken panes. [34]  
She saw stories inside each fragment the way other people saw their own wincing reflections. [49]  
That knack for reading between lines of splintered glass made her the quiet oracle of the docks. [66]  
Today, before everything shifts, she intended to finish the work her mother began. [79]  
At the edge of town rose the prism atrium in mist, a half-forgotten lighthouse of colored glass panels. [97]  
It once showered the fish market with rainbow geometry, but storms had webbed its panes with cracks too fine to notice from afar. [120]  
Mira believed those spidering fractures mirrored the town itself, and that by mending them she could mend what lived behind them. [141]  
Yet she needed guidance, because glass never lies and therefore must be bargained with. [155]  
So she walked inland toward the lily pond where the old salt sages used to commune with coming weather. [174]  
Her mother had taught her the method: toss a stone, watch the rings, and let patterns answer. [191]  
By translating concentric tremors, a glazier could overhear tectonic murmurs no ear could record. [205]  
Locals called these noctilucent reckonings, because on the darkest nights the pond ripples caught ghostly sky-glow and wrote ledgers of consequence. [226]  
Dawn light lacked those opalescent flames, but Mira trusted memory to provide the shine. [240]  
She selected a flat fragment of green bottle, colder than the air, and flicked it into the still water. [259]  
Circles bloomed outward, bending reflections of rusted cranes, gulls, and the distant prism atrium drowning in its veil of vapor. [279]  
Mira knelt, fingers hovering just above the surface, and began to commune through the patterns in the rings. [297]  
First ring spoke of hairline seams, splitting yet salvageable; second ring whispered of weight, that every pane remembered the wind that bruised it. [320]  
The third, faintest ring carried a chill: repair must finish by nightfall, otherwise all alignments would tilt. [337]  
She heard, beneath that warning, another plea, fragile as a child tracing letters on fogged glass. [353]  
It begged her to illuminate value in the mundane before the town forgot how to look. [369]  
Purpose clarified her breath; she rose and hurried back toward the coast, morning gulls unspooling threads of salt behind her. [389]  
By the time she reached the atrium, sun shards speared the mist, making the glass labyrinth glow like reef coral. [409]  
Inside, silence held the taste of minerals and old prayers. [419]  
She unpacked her satchel: lead strips, soldering wand, and dozens of salvaged fragments she had polished until ordinary daylight backed away. [440]  
Mira worked, not replacing but reweaving, sliding blue beside dull brown, slipping a chipped beer bottle crescent into a cathedral-grade rose. [461]  
She read between lines of lead came, tracking how each new seam bent sunbeams toward crates, nets, and bored deckhands outside. [482]  
Men who had never noticed anything but tide schedules suddenly paused, faces lit by shifting mosaics that painted their wrinkles gold. [503]  
They did not know why their chests lifted, only that something common had refracted into astonishment. [519]  
Outside the atrium, clouds thinned, and a translucent veil stretched across the upper sky like a hidden notebook page. [538]  
Night scientists would later label the phenomenon pre-noctilucent formation, but Mira felt the pond's prophecy unfolding. [554]  
When the final pane snapped into place, a single ray broke through, ricocheting inside the atrium until every fracture gleamed. [574]  
The structure no longer hid its wounds; it sang through them, turning error into aperture. [589]  
Harbor bells rang noon, but inside the glass cathedral dawn kept happening, each second scattering first light across coils of rope and puddles of fish-scale dust. [615]  
Deckhands laughed without reason, gulls circled like thrown confetti, and even the accountant at the pier booth lost count on purpose. [636]  
Mira stepped outside, feeling the atmosphere tilt, yet steadied by what she had coaxed from glass and guidance. [654]  
She realized the shift the rings foretold was not calamity but calibration, a reminder that beauty adjusts the axis of perception. [675]  
As afternoon advanced, the sky ignited with early noctilucent filaments, pale blue fire scratching signatures onto the horizon. [693]  
Villagers pointed upward, wonder flowering where routine once sat heavy, and Mira smiled, seeing glimmers of atrium color in their pupils. [714]  
The mundane had been given back to them enwoven with light, just in time for night to arrive different than before. [735]  
And somewhere behind the warehouses, a pond settled, its rings closing like gentle eyelids, satisfied that the message was received. [755]
