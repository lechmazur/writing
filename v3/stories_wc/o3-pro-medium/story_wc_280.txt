The mall where I manage nighttime maintenance empties by nine, and I lock the glass doors behind the last cashier. [20]  
After the business closes, I wander its forgotten corridors the way a child revisits a summer creek now quiet. [39]  
Lately the corridors have whispered colors into my ears, a synesthetically blessed tingle I never asked for. [56]  
Tonight the whispers insist I exit through the emergency gate and cross the parking lot to the abandoned adjoining theater. [76]  
The theater once hosted touring musicals before streaming swallowed the town, but its courtyard hedge still hides a secret maze. [96]  
I duck into the breach left by gardeners long laid off and feel branches knit behind me, sealing daylight away. [116]  
Moonlight drips through lattice leaves onto a mystic orchard garden concealed within the hedge maze, each apple glowing faint indigo. [136]  
The colors sing C-sharp in my nostrils, and nostalgia rises like chimney smoke from winters I have yet to live. [156]  
At the clearing's center waits an antique prop trunk and, atop it, a hand-painted tarot coin shimmering with wet lacquer. [176]  
Its face shows The Fool stepping simultaneously forward and backward, as if the artist believed time itself might stutter. [195]  
When I lift the coin, velvet curtains materialize between pear trees, and a ghost in tailcoat bows to silent applause. [215]  
He glows gray as chalk dust, yet his smile is bright enough to paint scents of trumpet flourishes across my tongue. [236]  
"I am Lazzaro, encore-seeking stage ghost," he declares, his voice ringing visible in concentric silver ripples through the orchard. [255]  
Decades ago he collapsed mid-aria, denied a final ovation, and now he hunts ears willing to clap him home. [274]  
But tonight his ambition is larger than applause; he says the timeline is fractured, and only a witness can mend it. [295]  
Each performance he gives spirals backward into his death scene, trapping him at the brink of despair just before encores arrive. [316]  
He needs me to lure possibility from that brink, to intertwine the audience's future with his aborted past. [334]  
I ask how a janitor can manage such braidwork, and he shows me the coin's obverse: a theater mask split like yinyang. [356]  
Lazzaro presses the mask against my sternum, and my heartbeat becomes a metronome whose ticks I can taste as saffron. [376]  
"When you breathe," he says, "breathe echoes, not air; that is how we rescore time." [391]  
I inhale, exhale, and orchard shadows mimic the motion half a second late, as though reluctant memories are catching up. [411]  
The delay widens until two distinct presents run beside each other like twin rails, sparks of overlap zigzagging between them. [431]  
In one rail I stand alone; in the other, Lazzaro belts an impossible high note that smells unmistakably of seawater and brass. [453]  
The note ricochets through both rails by producing echoes, gathering momentum until it resembles a corridor of infinite mirrors. [472]  
These echoes intertwine with my saffron heartbeat, braiding sound and pulse into a rope thick enough to haul realities together. [492]  
As the rails merge, I glimpse a loop: Lazzaro dropping onstage, audience gasping, ambulance siren, curtain forever stuck half-open. [511]  
I throw the rope of sound toward that scene, and possibility grabs it like a drowning swimmer accepts a hand. [531]  
The loop snaps; applause erupts across the orchard, sudden as summer rain on tin roofs my childhood never actually had. [551]  
Light spills upward, rewinding dusk into noon, yet the nostalgia that rises inside me feels earned, not borrowed. [569]  
Lazzaro stands upright, no longer chalked but rosy, and he nods toward the hedge where sirens once wailed. [587]  
"Your encore," I whisper, and begin clapping; each slap of palm against palm releases citrus light that perfumes the recovered afternoon. [608]  
Crowds fade in around us, patrons from every lost show, their clothing decades apart yet harmonized by shared relief. [627]  
Time is no longer fractured but facet-cut, shining different eras toward one center the way apples once glimmered indigo. [646]  
I pocket the tarot coin, its lacquer dry now, and sense the orchard will wait nightly for any heart gone color-deaf. [667]  
My shift technically begins again at dawn, but the mall's linoleum will never echo like this remembered applause, and I decide to be late. [691]  
Some debts, after all, are settled only when possibility hears its own name shouted back across the maze. [709]  
And tonight, echoes are plentiful. [714]
