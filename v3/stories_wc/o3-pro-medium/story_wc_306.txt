After the campfire's last spark dies, I hike toward the breezy lighthouse at dawn. [14]  
The path smells of wet cedar and possibilities, but my pocket feels heavier than hope. [29]  
Inside rests a hollow mirror shard that refuses to show me anything except what is missing. [45]  
I meant to discard it, yet its silence sticks like burrs to my thinking. [59]  
Tonight I am meeting someone advertised as a conscience for hire, because mine retired in exhaustion. [75]  
The listing promised protected vulnerability, whatever that means to a heart already wearing chainmail. [89]  
At the lighthouse door, brass wind chimes ring out twelve distinct notes, then wait for my reply. [106]  
I have studied the coded manual, so I answer by deciphering wind chime selections with gloved fingers. [123]  
Low note, high note, silence—permission granted. [129]  
The door unhooks itself from a rusted chain, and sea air drapes around me like explanation. [145]  
Inside, a man sits on an overturned bucket, shoulders shrouded in what he calls the cloak of doubt. [163]  
The fabric seems woven of fog and second thoughts, yet feels oddly reassuring to behold. [178]  
"Welcome nuance into certainty, and certainty will not break you," he says, voice sincerely insincere, like truthful mockingbird song. [197]  
I hand him the hollow mirror shard, hoping for a prescription stronger than reflection. [211]  
He holds it up, but the shard shows only the kneeling moon withdrawing through a cracked window. [228]  
"Your problem isn't what you see; it's what you assume about what you don't," he murmurs. [244]  
I consider arguing, but his cloak ripples, scattering my resolve like gulls startled off a pier. [260]  
Instead, I ask for instructions. [265]  
"Listen to the tower," he says, gesturing upward where stairs spiral into dimness thick with salt. [281]  
"My fee is simple: decide nothing until dawn is full, and pay me with the conclusion you reach. [299]  
Even as he speaks, the first coral stripe of sun presses through the horizon slit. [314]  
I climb the stairs, trailing echoing steps and half-formed judgments I am practicing not to trust. [330]  
The lantern room is glassy and brightening, its windows framed by wind chimes identical to those below. [347]  
When the breeze slips through, every chime offers a note, and meanings jostle like crowded constellations. [363]  
I sit cross-legged and begin deciphering wind chime selections exactly as the manual described. [377]  
Low, low, pause: hold judgement. [382]  
High, middle, low: suspect conclusions offering comfort before complexity. [391]  
The chimes compose an ethic more musical than legalistic, and every phrase loosens another knot in me. [408]  
Soon the lighthouse feels less like a guidepost and more like a lung, inhaling and exhaling arguments. [425]  
Through the window, the ocean keeps secrets without locking them, the very model of nuanced certainty. [441]  
I realize the hollow mirror shard never lacked reflection; it merely waited for me to supply context. [458]  
With the insight, something inside unhooks—a rusty certainty dangling too long across my inward doorway. [473]  
I descend as a slate sky blushes under the full arrival of morning. [486]  
The conscience for hire still waits on the bucket, examining barnacle patterns as though reading scripture. [502]  
"Payment time," he says, sincerely insincere grin shining like flotsam polished by weather. [515]  
I give him neither coin nor verdict, only the cloak of doubt, which I now wear comfortably within. [533]  
He laughs, unoffended, and drapes the fog-gray fabric over his arm as though retiring a prop. [549]  
"You welcomed nuance into certainty; that is worth more than answers," he says, standing to leave. [565]  
As he passes, the wind catches the cloak, swelling it to a sail that ferries his silhouette away. [583]  
He vanishes beyond dune grass while the lighthouse gleams like a kept promise behind me. [598]  
I slip the mirror shard into the surf, letting its hollowness fill with moving sky. [613]  
Walking home, I carry no artifacts, only a breeze that suggests decisions can breathe, not ossify. [629]
