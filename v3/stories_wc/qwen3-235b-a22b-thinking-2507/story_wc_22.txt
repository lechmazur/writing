The gloom-hill coachman stood alone on the blooming jetty at twilight, his knuckles white on the rail as he surveyed the dead reef’s skeletal remains stretching into the ink-black sea. [28]  
After the reef dies, the silence becomes a physical thing, pressing against the ears like deep water, and Elias remembered when the submerged concord of coral and fish-song filled these waters with life. [60]  
He clutched his only treasure—a collection of dried seed pods rattling softly in a burlap sack—to his chest, the brittle husks holding the promise of green defiance against the salt-scoured battlefield that once echoed with artillery. [98]  
His motivation burned simple: to let a garden reclaim this scarred earth, transforming the killing ground where he’d hauled the wounded and the dead in his carriage during the Coastal War. [134]  
Elias spoke dead languages fluently, a skill learned from his grandmother who whispered to spirits in tongues forgotten by the living, and now he needed it to hear what the birds knew. [171]  
For the method to fertilize this barren strip was not shovels or compost but understanding bird calls—the terns’ cries held secrets of soil health, the herons’ guttural croaks mapped hidden veins of nutrients beneath the sand. [215]  
He closed his eyes and listened, the narrow vastness of the jetty making the endless ocean feel intimate yet crushing, as a lone sandpiper piped a query in Proto-Thalassian, a language of drowned coastal tribes. [259]  
"K’tara valin," Elias murmured back in the dead tongue, meaning "the earth thirsts," and the bird cocked its head, recognizing the ancestral words lost to modern ears. [295]  
The sandpiper hopped forward, pecking insistently at a patch of grey soil near the jetty’s crumbling pilings—a signal the earth there could be revived. [328]  
Elias knelt, the dried seed pods spilling into his palm as he recalled the submerged concord: the reef’s symphony of clicks and pulses that maintained balance, now silenced forever by the war’s chemical tides. [368]  
He understood this new concord must rise from land, not water, so he scattered the pods—sea holly and saltwort—into the spot the bird indicated, then crushed others to fertilize the soil with their powdery insides. [409]  
The action felt sacred; each pod’s release was a vow to heal where cannons had torn the earth. [438]  
As he worked, a flock of oystercatchers descended, their red beaks flashing, calling in the guttural dialect of the First Mariners, another dead language Elias knew from his grandmother’s lullabies. [478]  
"Y’shal maren," he replied, "the garden wakes," and the birds began dropping tiny shell fragments they’d carried from distant shores, enriching the soil with calcium like ancient farmers once did. [517]  
This was how the land would remember: not through monuments to war, but through roots drinking in the birds’ gifts, turning the battlefield into a tapestry of blooms. [555]  
The jetty itself, once a military supply point, now overflowed with evening primrose and sea lavender, their purple heads nodding in the twilight breeze—a fragile victory against the dead reef’s shadow. [597]  
Elias felt the narrow vastness deepen as stars pricked the violet sky; the ocean’s emptiness stretched infinitely, yet the jetty’s three hundred feet held a universe of renewal. [636]  
He’d driven coaches through Gloom Hill’s foggy valleys for fifty years, ferrying mourners to graves, but here he was finally building life instead of bearing death. [672]  
A curlew’s mournful cry echoed the reef’s lost harmony, but Elias answered in Atlantean, "Neru solas," meaning "new roots bind," and the bird spiraled upward, scattering seeds from its feathers. [714]  
This ritual—fertilizing by understanding bird calls—was slow, patient work, but the garden was gaining ground, inch by inch, reclaiming trenches and shell craters with wildflowers. [752]  
He thought of the reef’s submerged concord, how its collapse had doomed the coast, and knew this narrow strip of land must become a new anchor for balance. [788]  
As the last light bled from the sky, Elias poured the final seed pods into the earth, whispering thanks in a language older than the hills, and the birds fell silent in reverence. [828]  
The garden would grow, he knew, because even in narrow vastness, life finds a way to listen, to heal, to rise from what the dead have left behind. [865]  
He turned toward Gloom Hill, the empty sack light on his shoulder, already planning tomorrow’s journey to gather more pods from the inland dunes. [899]
