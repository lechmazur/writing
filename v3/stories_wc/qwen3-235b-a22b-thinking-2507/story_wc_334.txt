<story>Dr Aris Thorne adjusted her salt-crusted goggles, surveying the skeletal remains of the Glasshaven Orchard greenhouse through the murk. [18] Decades later, the flooded valley still held its breath beneath twenty feet of brackish water, the structure’s iron ribs coiled like a serpent’s spine among drowned apple trees. [44] Shipwrecks—rotting schooners and a rusted trawler—ringed the site like broken teeth, their prows buried in silt where the river had swallowed the hillside. [71] Aris, a hands-on folklorist who’d scraped lichen from standing stones and whispered to river spirits in three continents, felt the familiar prickle of her chronically curious nature. [104] She’d returned to this sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks not for academic papers but to recover stolen memories—her own childhood recollections of harvest festivals, siphoned away when the floodwaters surged. [143] The disaster had shattered routines overnight; when habits break, she’d learned, ghosts fester in the cracks. [168] Now, at sixty-two, she’d spent years chasing whispers of a water-witch who traded memories for safe passage through storms. [196] Her only clue lay in the local tale of the fairy ring mushroom, a circle of poisonous Amanita muscaria said to bloom where time frayed. [228] Aris kicked downward, her fins stirring clouds of sediment that dimmed the weak sunlight piercing the surface. [254] Above, through the greenhouse’s shattered glass dome, constellations should have been visible—Orion’s belt, Cassiopeia’s chair—but the flood had fractured the panes into jagged shards. [293] This was her method: to detect the witch’s lair by studying broken constellations. [315] She’d mapped the original star alignments from Glasshaven’s blueprints; now, distorted reflections in the glass fragments would reveal where reality had torn. [348] Pulling a waterproof journal from her dive bag, she angled a brass sextant toward the fractured sky. [374] One pane magnified Vega into a smear; another split Polaris into twin points like a broken promise. [398] Her pulse quickened—this disarray wasn’t random. [413] Comparing it to her chart, she traced the aberrations: the shattered Pleiades cluster pointed directly toward the orchard’s heart. [442] Where habits break, folklore warned, the land remembers what people forget. [463] She swam toward the coordinates, her headlamp catching the glow of phosphorescent algae clinging to apple boughs. [490] There, nestled among skeletal roots, the fairy ring mushroom glowed faintly—a perfect circle of crimson caps ringed with white flecks, untouched by decay. [522] Aris hovered above it, recalling her grandmother’s stories: such rings were doorways, memory vaults for entities who fed on nostalgia. [554] Crisp nostalgia tightened her chest—the sharp scent of crushed mint from childhood picnics, the exact pitch of her mother’s laughter—fleeting, almost recovered. [588] The witch hadn’t stolen memories; she’d preserved them here, in the ring’s fungal network, to be reclaimed only when the stars realigned. [621] Aris reached out, her gloved hand trembling. [634] As a hands-on folklorist, she knew theory meant nothing without touch. [655] She pressed a palm to the central mushroom, its surface cool and velvety. [675] Instantly, the broken constellations above flared—not in the sky, but in her mind’s eye. [698] Shards of light reassembled into Orion’s belt, now whole, guiding her inward. [717] Visions flooded her: her seven-year-old self hiding in the greenhouse during the flood’s first roar, watching the witch—a woman woven from river reeds and starlight—press a hand to the glass as the waters rose. [762] The witch hadn’t stolen; she’d shielded Aris’s memories from the trauma, storing them in the ring for safekeeping. [791] Tears blurred Aris’s vision behind her mask, salty as the flooded valley. [810] She’d spent decades believing herself robbed, yet the truth was gentler: the witch had been a guardian. [836] Aris withdrew her hand, the fairy ring dimming as the memories settled into her bones—crisp, vivid, and finally hers. [864] Above, the shipwrecks stood sentinel as she ascended, carrying not just recovered recollections but the weight of forgiveness. [892] The valley would never dry, but its ghosts, like hers, were now at peace. [913] She broke the surface, sunlight sharp on her face, and breathed the air of a world where habits might yet mend.
