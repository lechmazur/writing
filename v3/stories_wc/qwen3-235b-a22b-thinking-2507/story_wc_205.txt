<story>Elara traced the jagged edge of the crystal vase shard, its facets catching the eerie glow of visible time—a slow, amber river now flowing through the baroque asteroid's crumbling corridors. [54] Once a fiery revolutionary who’d shattered the old theocratic order, she was now a ghost haunting the gilded ruins she’d helped create, her poetic soul drowned in burnished sorrow. [103] The shard, smuggled from the Grand Archive excavation, was the last piece of the Argent Chalice, proof the ancients hadn’t merely worshipped light but understood time’s new visibility after the Chronos Event. [163] Scholarly factions argued bitterly: the Pragmatists claimed the Chalice was mundane pottery, while the Luminists insisted it channeled temporal energy, a dispute threatening to reignite the civil war Elara’s failed revolution had sought to end. [228] Her motivation burned fierce beneath the sorrow—to reimagine the entire Celestine civilization not as dogma, but as a beacon of harmony with time’s new flow, a truth her youthful zeal had obliterated. [289] Outside the fractured dome of the Oratory, a temporal storm gathered, its winds distorting the visible time-rivers into jagged, dangerous rapids; the old ritual of covering every mirror during such storms, once dismissed as superstition, now made desperate sense. [357] Elara remembered her grandmother’s voice: "Mirrors fracture time’s reflection in the storm, child. Madness follows." [393] The Pragmatist delegation arrived at dawn, their leader, Varek, demanding the shard as evidence for their mundane interpretation, his eyes hard with ideological certainty. [442] "That fragment proves nothing but shattered glass, Elara," Varek sneered, gesturing at the asteroid’s decaying frescoes depicting mirror-covering rituals. [487] "Your poetic fantasies won’t rewrite history." [506] The Luminists would claim it next, twisting its meaning into mysticism; Elara knew the shard’s true purpose lay hidden, a key to understanding the ancients’ sophisticated temporal science, lost when her revolution burned the libraries. [567] She had to devise a demonstration—something undeniable—that would settle the dispute and reveal the shard’s role in the mirror ritual before the factions turned violent. [620] As the storm’s first temporal gusts rattled the stained-glass apse, she acted. [644] Ignoring Varek’s protests, Elara placed the crystal shard within the frame of the Oratory’s largest uncovered mirror, positioning it where the visible time-river bled through the broken dome. [702] She began reciting an old verse, her voice trembling with poetic precision: "When time’s stream churns, the shard aligns the fractured sky, / To shield the soul from fractured time’s reply." [749] The storm hit its peak; outside, the amber time-rivers flared violently. [773] Through the uncovered mirrors elsewhere in the asteroid, people screamed as distorted temporal reflections induced vertigo and panic—except in the Oratory. [815] The crystal shard, catching the chaotic light, refracted it into a single, steady beam that struck the mirror’s surface, not shattering the reflection but calming it, stabilizing the viewer’s perception against the storm’s temporal chaos. [878] Varek stared, his pragmatic certainty crumbling as the mirror showed only his own awestruck face, clear and undistorted, while the storm raged harmlessly around the focused beam. [932] "They didn’t cover mirrors to hide from time," Elara whispered, tears tracing paths through the asteroid dust on her cheeks, the burnished sorrow of her failure now absolute. [987] "They covered them to protect us from time’s rage—using science, not prayer. We destroyed the very wisdom we needed to survive this new age." [1043] The shard’s purpose was proven, the dispute settled not by ideology but irrefutable light, yet Elara felt no victory. [1086] She had reimagined the civilization, glimpsed its profound grace, only to confront the hollow cost of her revolution: she’d shattered the vase, and with it, the future. [1140] As the storm passed, leaving time’s rivers smooth and golden once more, she sat alone in the baroque silence, the crystal shard cold in her palm, mourning a world she could never rebuild.
