<story>The ritual had failed, leaving the druid stranded in the swirling orchard vortex at the heart of the cursed lake. [14] Around them, apple trees twisted mid-rotation, roots tearing free from the black water, branches snapping like brittle bones in the perpetual gale. [32] Kael, the guarded druid, stood motionless on a fragment of ice, his knuckles white on the staff that channeled his earth-song. [54] His eyes, sharp as flint, scanned the chaos—not with panic, but with warlike serenity, the calm of a soldier assessing a battlefield after the first volley. [82] He had come here seeking what mirrors didn’t show: the lake’s hidden truth, the reason reflections only revealed surfaces, never depths. [107] The magic trick—the ritual to pierce that veil—had shattered, freezing his confession mid-whisper into a jagged shard of ice now lost in the vortex. [138] That frozen confession held his shame: he’d caused the curse by stealing the lake’s heart-seed years ago. [162] To break the curse, he needed it back, for only by confronting what mirrors concealed could the lake heal. [188] His gift—to find lost things—was his only hope now, but the vortex fought him, its currents swallowing light and sound. [217] He closed his eyes, centering himself, and began the search through expanding circles. [239] First, a pulse of energy rippled from his feet, gentle as a breath, testing the nearest ice floes. [264] Then another circle, wider, brushing against gnarled roots and floating blossoms. [287] A third, stronger, reached the orchard’s whirling edge where the water churned like tar. [312] Each expansion tightened his chest, the lake resisting his intrusion with icy tendrils that clawed at his cloak. [339] On the fifth circle, his gift flared—a sharp, metallic tang in the air, the scent of decayed petals and hunger. [370] There. [373] Tucked beneath a submerged willow branch, half-buried in silt, glowed the flesh-eating plant seed he’d carried as a ward. [402] It pulsed faintly, its obsidian surface veined with crimson, drawn to the vortex’s malice. [428] Kael waded toward it, water numbing his legs, the seed’s presence a beacon in the disarray. [455] He plucked it from the mud, its cold weight a grim comfort. [475] This seed, stolen from the very orchard now consuming him, could devour the vortex’s lies—but only if he reached the frozen confession first. [510] The expanding circles had shown its location: deep in the vortex’s eye, where the water spun black and still. [541] But the path was knotted, reality itself bent by the curse into impossible spirals. [568] To walk it, he’d need to unbend the distortion. [585] Kael planted the seed into a crack in the ice, whispering an old growth-song. [608] The seed split open, unfurling a thorny vine that lashed toward the vortex’s core. [634] He gripped the vine, feeling its hunger vibrate up his arm, and pulled himself forward. [659] With each step, the vine tightened, forcing the twisted space to straighten—unbending the chaos into a narrow, temporary causeway. [696] Ice shards rained down as the vortex shrieked, branches whipping at his face, but he moved with warlike serenity, focused only on the glint ahead. [735] There, embedded in a pillar of frozen mist, was his confession: his own voice trapped in ice, mouthing the words he’d spoken to break the curse. [774] He reached out, the flesh-eating vine recoiling as he touched the cold surface. [799] To understand what mirrors hid—the lake’s true wound—he had to thaw this truth. [820] Kael pressed his palm flat against the ice and exhaled, his breath steaming in the unnatural cold. [847] The confession didn’t melt; it shattered. [860] Shards fell like rain, each fragment reflecting not his face, but the lake’s forgotten history: a child drowning, a promise broken, the moment he’d taken the heart-seed to save his dying village. [903] Mirrors showed only the present, but this truth was the curse’s root—the unspoken guilt that festered beneath. [934] The vortex stilled. [941] Trees settled into the water, blossoms drifting like snow onto the now-calm lake. [960] Kael pocketed a single ice shard, the seed’s vine withering to dust in his hand. [983] He turned toward the shore, the confession’s weight lighter now, knowing some truths could only be found when you stopped hiding from them. [1025] </story>
