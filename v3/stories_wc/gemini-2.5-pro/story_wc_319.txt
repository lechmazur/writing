Lyel did not remember names, but he remembered the garden. [10] It was a place of frozen, skeletal roses and statues weeping icy tears into a thick, perpetual mist. [26] He was its guardian, just as he was the guardian of the stone library that loomed behind it, a feral thing of sharp senses and forgotten softness. [50] His existence was a long, slow act of interiorizing exteriors; the garden's frost was the ice in his own veins, the mist was the fog that clouded his memory of home. [79] A deep, resonant ache of being dimensionally homesick was the only warmth he had left. [94] So he would wait. [98]

The transition always came through the veil of sleep, a slow drift where the garden outside his makeshift den became indistinguishable from the landscapes of his dreaming mind. [127] One night, a flicker of wrongness disturbed the grey calm. [137] A shape moved at the edge of the mist, a place where the boundaries of light were a frayed and uncertain suggestion. [156] Lyel rose, a low growl vibrating in his chest, his form a shadow within shadows. [172] The intruder, cloaked and chanting in a low whisper, reached for the library's ancient oak doors before Lyel’s silent charge sent them stumbling back into the fog with a muffled cry. [206] They were gone, but something dark and metallic lay gleaming on the frosted grass. [221]

He nudged it with a wary finger. [227] It was a cultist's pendant, a twisted spiral of silver and obsidian that seemed to drink the meager light. [245] As his skin made contact, a jolt of foul energy, a corrupted echo of the pathways between worlds, shot up his arm. [267] It smelled of ozone and desperate ambition, a stark contrast to the clean, sorrowful hum of his own displacement. [287] The pendant felt like a key to a door he desperately wanted to open, but he knew with primal certainty that the door itself was a lie. [315] He carried the object back to his nest of discarded book pages, its presence a cold weight against his chest. [335] His long wait was now poisoned by a terrible, specific hope. [346]

Days turned into a featureless cycle of mist and twilight, the pendant a constant, humming temptation. [362] It seemed to whisper to him, promising to sharpen the boundaries of light, to cut a path through the fog of his existence back to the vibrant, sun-drenched world he could barely recall. [396] He felt his resolve fraying, the deep-seated motivation to simply endure shifting into something more dangerous. [413] He had to make friends with uncertainty, but this object promised a terrible, absolute certainty. [429]

The change came, as it had before, through the veil of sleep. [440] Lyel was jolted awake not by a sound, but by a sudden, violent clarity in the mist. [456] The pendant on his chest burned with cold light, pulsing in rhythm with a tear that was opening in the heart of the garden. [479] It was not a gentle parting of the veil but a wound, a jagged rip in reality bleeding raw energy. [499] Through it, he saw it: the impossible cerulean sky of his home, the scent of blossoms he hadn't known he remembered. [522] The cultists were elsewhere, using the pendant as their anchor, their ritual a distant thrumming. [538] His entire being screamed to leap through, to end the ache, to go home. [553] The garden held its frozen breath. [559]

He looked at the violent, shrieking edges of the portal, and then at the quiet, sleeping stones of the library he protected. [580] He had interiorized this cold, silent exterior for so long it had become a part of him, a truth as real as his loss. [605] To leave it now for that violent promise felt like a betrayal of the stillness he had cultivated. [622] He would not trade one cage for another. [629] Grasping the pendant, Lyel didn't throw it or break it; he poured his own longing into it, his decades of patient, lonely waiting, his profound homesickness, using its energy to smother the cultists' signal. [665] He pushed the feeling of uncertainty, of mist and fog, into the tear. [678]

The portal wavered, the vision of home dissolving like a watercolor in rain. [692] With a final, sorrowful sigh, the rift sealed itself shut, leaving only silence and the gently swirling mist. [711] The pendant in his hand was just cold, dead metal now. [721] Lyel stood in the frozen garden, the air crisp and clean. [731] The ache in his chest remained, a familiar companion, but it was no longer a void. [747] He was still a guardian, still feral, still waiting. [756] But he was no longer waiting for home; he was waiting to see what the morning would bring. [772] He had made his peace with the fog. [780] </story>
