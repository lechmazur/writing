The last of my kind called me Kaelen, a name whose meaning had thinned to a whisper against the canyon's roar. [20] My skin, mapped with the faint blue-green of copper veins, felt the world more than saw it. [35] I lived among the towers of bone, colossal ribs and vertebrae of leviathans long dead, which clawed at a sky the color of dust. [57] This was the Chasm of In-An, the tunnel of echoes, where every sound ever made was trapped in a ceaseless, churning cascade. [78] The Old Tongue, my Old Tongue, was dying not from silence, but from being spoken all at once by a million phantom voices. [101]

I was a storyteller, though I had no one left to tell stories to. [115] My purpose, my quiet obsession, was not to tell the old tales but to save the language that formed them. [134] My elders believed meaning lived in breath and sound, but I knew they were wrong; it lived in the grain of things. [155] My motivation was to translate texture into sound, to read the world's skin and give it back its voice. [174] The ridged surface of a leviathan vertebra was a word, the grit of sandstone a phrase, the chill of shadow a sentence. [195] I had to find a way to make them heard above the din. [207]

My only tool was a stone the size of my thumb, a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed. [226] Outsiders, before they vanished, claimed it drained the life from a man's voice, but they misunderstood its function. [246] Its curse was its gift. [252] Deep within its heart was a fracture, a complex lattice that did not swallow sound but filtered it, if you knew how to orient it. [279] It could, I believed, catch a single true note from the hurricane of echoes. [294]

For years, I sought the key to its alignment. [304] I found the answer not in the dead rock but in the sky. [317] Every dusk, a flock of iron-feathered starlings would pour into the canyon, their flight a fluid, shifting tapestry against the fading light. [342] Their murmuration was not chaos but a script, a living syntax of the Old Tongue made visible. [360] I knew I must harness that fleeting geometry. [370] This was the method my heart had been searching for. [381]

I chose the tallest of the bone towers, a spire of fused spinal discs that vibrated with a deep, resonant texture I had never been able to decipher. [410] With the wind whipping my hair, I stood on the precipice, the entire history of my people's speech roaring up from below. [432] My copper-veined hands, usually steady, trembled as I raised the diamond. [445] I was quietly articulate in my thoughts, but this act was a prayer beyond words. [460]

The starlings arrived, a river of black ink flowing through the air. [473] I did not watch them with my eyes alone; I felt the pattern of their flight through my veins, a complex vibration that prickled my skin. [497] They swirled, contracted, and then formed a perfect, cascading spiral, a shape I recognized from the ancient glyphs for 'creation'. [520] At that moment, I twisted the diamond in my fingers, aligning its internal fracture with the axis of the flock's grand design. [543] I sought to harness the silent grammar of their movement to command the sound below. [559]

Silence. [560]
For the first time in my life, the canyon held its breath. [572] The endless echoes collapsed into nothing, the diamond having found the single thread required to unravel the noise. [591] Then, a new sound bloomed in the stillness, emanating not from my throat but from the stone in my hand. [612] It was a single, resonant tone, low and clear, like a plucked string the size of a mountain. [630] It was the sound of the bone tower's texture, the sound of its immense age and strength, the first true word of the Old Tongue spoken in a generation. [657] The language was not dead. [663] It had been waiting, etched in the substance of the world, for someone to learn how to read it again. [684] And I, the storyteller with no stories, now had the first line of a new one.
