The daydream unfurled like a bolt of grey silk, settling around Elian in the familiar quiet of the ruined orchard district. [22] Centuries of fog had claimed this place, muting the ghosts of apple blossoms and leaving only the damp scent of moss on crumbling brick. [45] In his hand, he cradled a fresco fragment, its surface cool and smooth against his palm, the only solid thing in this vaporous world. [68] It was a shard of a past life, showing a sliver of a painted smile he desperately needed to see in its entirety. [89] His motivation was simple, a quiet ache in his chest: to rediscover lost joy. [103]

He had been a vivid mural artist once, splashing walls with exuberant color, but the joy had faded from his hands, leaving them feeling empty. [129] Here, in the soft-edged logic of his own mind, perhaps he could find it again. [144] He closed his eyes, not against the fog, but to better see inward, connecting to the silent hum of the knowledge network. [165] It wasn’t a machine, but a shared current of thought, a library of every dream and skill ever recorded by his people. [186] He searched its ephemeral archives for the feeling of sun-warmed plaster and the specific hue of laughter. [202]

The network guided his steps past the skeletal remains of ancient espaliers, their forms like frozen lightning against the grey. [221] He found the wall, or what was left of it—a long, pockmarked stretch of stone at the district’s heart. [239] This was the canvas. [244] His tools were not brushes or pigments, for Elian’s unique attribute was that he could paint with light. [263] From his sleeve, he drew a small, polished silver cylinder that hummed with latent energy. [278]

He aimed it at the wall, and a soft beam of pearlescent light bloomed on the stone. [296] The core concept of his art was like working with exposed film; the memory he sought to project was a fragile, light-saturated negative, easily washed out or distorted by the very act of trying to view it. [335] Too much focus, too much desperation, and the image would flare into an indecipherable white. [351] He had to coax it out gently, letting the memory develop on its own terms. [366]

He began to paint, weaving strands of light into the shape of a gnarled apple tree, its branches heavy with spectral fruit. [388] The image wavered, colors bleeding at the edges as if the fog itself were trying to reclaim them. [407] Frustration pricked at him; the joy remained elusive, a phantom limb he could feel but not command. [425] The memory was incomplete, a photograph with a hole burned through its center. [438]

Then he remembered the fresco fragment in his other hand. [449] It was the anchor, the seed of the entire composition. [459] He raised the shard, letting the beam from his projector strike its surface. [473] For a moment, it absorbed the energy, and then it began to glow from within, projecting its own tiny, perfect piece of the puzzle onto the wall. [499] The fragment’s captured light resonated with the light he was painting, and suddenly, the entire image locked into place with a silent, breathtaking snap. [524]

His action was complete: to display the memory in its full glory. [536] The entire wall was now a vibrant mural of light, depicting two figures beneath the blossoming tree, their faces thrown back in a moment of pure, unburdened mirth. [563] One of them was a younger Elian, the other a face he hadn’t allowed himself to fully remember for years. [582] The soundless laughter was so powerful it seemed to press the air from his lungs. [598] A slow, pensive smile touched his own lips, a mirror to the joy on the wall but tempered with the soft sorrow of its passing. [623] This was it—not the boisterous glee of the past, but the gentle, bittersweet warmth of holding it close for just a moment. [645]

The edges of the daydream began to fray. [653] The light-mural flickered, the laughing faces dissolving back into the encroaching fog as the orchard district folded back into the recesses of his mind. [677] Soon, all that remained was Elian, standing in the quiet of his studio, the solid weight of the cool fresco fragment still resting in his palm. [703] The vision was gone, but the echo of its light, a pensive mirth, now warmed his chest, a joy rediscovered not in permanence, but in the beautiful, fleeting act of remembrance itself. [738]
