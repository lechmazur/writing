Elara had always been a hands-on folklorist, the kind who didn't just read about legends but dove into them, mud on her boots and notes scribbled in the margins of ancient tomes. [28]
Her chronically curious nature had led her to forgotten corners of the world, chasing whispers of the supernatural. [44]
But decades ago, in her reckless youth, that curiosity had cost her dearly in a place she'd tried to forget: the sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks. [69]
It was a relic of some long-ago catastrophe, where an experimental botanical dome had plummeted into a coastal abyss, surrounded by the skeletal hulls of vessels claimed by the same furious storm. [102]
Orchards of twisted apple trees still bloomed eerily underwater, their fruits glowing faintly through the glass, preserved by some quirk of pressure and forgotten science. [127]
Elara remembered the crisp chill of the dive suit, the nostalgic pull of adventure that had drawn her there as a young researcher. [149]
She'd heard tales of fairy rings in drowned places, portals to other realms, and her curiosity wouldn't let her resist. [168]
Slipping through a breach in the greenhouse dome, she'd found it: a perfect circle of fairy ring mushrooms sprouting from the silty floor, their caps luminescent in the dim light. [196]
Touching one, she'd felt a jolt, and then—nothing. [203]
Memories vanished, stolen by whatever entity lurked in that ring, leaving her with gaps in her life story, habits formed around the voids. [226]
For decades, she'd built a routine life, teaching folklore at a quiet university, her dives replaced by lectures, her curiosity tempered into safe academia. [250]
But now, when habits break—as they do in the autumn of one's years, with retirement looming and the weight of unfinished business pressing in—Elara felt the old pull return. [279]
Her daily walks turned into restless pacings; her neat lesson plans scattered like leaves in the wind. [296]
It was time to recover those stolen memories, to piece together the fragments of who she'd been before the ring took them. [318]
Decades later, she returned to the site, chartering a submersible to descend into the abyss where the shipwrecks formed a jagged corona around the greenhouse. [342]
The place hadn't changed much; the orchard trees waved in gentle currents, their blossoms a crisp reminder of lost summers. [362]
Nostalgia hit her like a fresh breeze, sharpening the edges of what little she recalled: laughter with fellow explorers, the thrill of discovery, all blurred at the edges by the theft. [392]
Suited up once more, she entered the dome, her hands-on instincts guiding her through the murky water. [408]
The fairy ring mushrooms were still there, encircling a patch of floor where sediment swirled like forgotten dreams. [425]
But she wouldn't touch them blindly this time; her motivation burned clearer now, fueled by years of wondering what parts of herself had been erased. [449]
To detect the way back into those stolen memories, she knew she had to approach it differently. [465]
Folklore spoke of fairies navigating by stars, and in this underwater tomb, the shipwrecks provided a twisted analogue. [483]
Their rusted frames pierced the dome's perimeter, portholes shattered into patterns that mimicked broken constellations, fragments of the night sky refracted through water and glass. [509]
Elara floated there, studying those broken constellations, mapping the irregularities where light from her submersible's beam diffracted off jagged metal and into the fairy ring. [534]
It was a method born of her chronic curiosity, piecing together how the "stars" aligned differently now, decades later, revealing shifts in the ethereal veil. [558]
One constellation, resembling a fractured Orion, pointed to a mushroom cap that pulsed faintly. [571]
Detecting the anomaly, she pressed it gently, not with greed but with the crisp nostalgia of reclaiming her past. [590]
Memories flooded back: a fairy encounter in the ring, their bargain for knowledge that she'd unwittingly agreed to, exchanging recollections for glimpses of hidden worlds. [615]
She saw her younger self, vibrant and unafraid, trading stories with ethereal beings amid the blooming orchards. [632]
The theft hadn't been malicious but a fairy's whim, memories held in escrow until she returned wiser. [648]
Now, with habits broken and curiosity undimmed, Elara emerged from the dome, whole again. [661]
The sunken greenhouse faded behind her as she ascended, shipwrecks whispering farewells. [673]
Decades later, she knew the real treasure was not the legends she chased, but the self she recovered in their pursuit. [693]
On the surface, under a true starry sky, she smiled at the crisp nostalgia of it all, ready for whatever curiosity beckoned next. [716]
