In the fading echoes of a world where the seas had given their last, Elandor the mage stood on the sapphire viaduct at dawn. [18]
He was a lukewarm mage, his powers tepid like half-boiled tea, never surging with the fire of legends but simmering just enough to get by. [42]
Earnestly naive, he believed that good intentions could mend any rift, even as the cosmic imbalance tilted the very fabric of reality. [64]
The viaduct, a glittering bridge of deep blue gemstone arching over the now-barren ocean, shimmered with the first light, its surface etched with ancient runes that whispered of forgotten tides. [92]
Below, the waves lapped emptily, for the last fish had been caught moons ago, signaling the end of an era and the start of chaos. [116]
Elandor's motivation burned within him: to right this cosmic imbalance, to restore the harmony between land and sea before the viaduct itself crumbled into the abyss. [142]
Clutched in his trembling hands was the broken ship's bell, its bronze cracked and silent, salvaged from a wrecked vessel that had once heralded bountiful catches. [167]
This bell, he knew from dusty tomes, held the key to rebuilding the fragile bond between worlds. [182]
But his devotion was brittle, a thin veneer of faith that could shatter under doubt, yet he pressed on, naive to the perils. [204]
As dawn's golden fingers stretched across the sapphire expanse, Elandor placed the bell at the viaduct's apex, where the gemstone pulsed like a living heart. [228]
The air hummed with plausible impossibility, a tone where magic felt as real as the salt on the breeze, defying logic yet fitting seamlessly into the world's weary logic. [256]
He had studied the method meticulously: understanding dripping rates, the precise tempo at which water—or in this case, liquefied sapphire—dripped from the viaduct's edges. [279]
Each drop carried essence of the sea's lost vitality, and by measuring their fall, he could synchronize the bell's reconstruction with the cosmic rhythm. [301]
Elandor knelt, his robes brushing the cool blue surface, and began the ritual. [312]
First, he traced the bell's fracture with a finger, channeling his lukewarm magic to heat the metal just enough to make it malleable. [335]
Drops fell from the viaduct's underside, where the sapphire wept in response to the imbalance, each plink echoing like a heartbeat out of sync. [357]
He counted them earnestly, naively trusting that his calculations were flawless, ignoring the whispers of doubt that his brittle devotion amplified. [376]
One drop every seven breaths for the first phase, accelerating to three per breath as the sun climbed. [394]
This understanding of dripping rates was no mere guesswork; it mirrored the ancient flow of fish through the seas, now stilled. [415]
With each measured drip, Elandor infused the bell with slivers of his magic, willing the cracks to knit. [432]
The viaduct trembled slightly, as if acknowledging the attempt to rebuild what had been lost. [445]
Memories flooded him: villages starving after the last fish, skies darkening with unnatural storms, the cosmic scales tipping toward oblivion. [463]
His motivation deepened, a desperate bid to right it all, even as his naive heart wondered if one lukewarm mage could truly suffice. [484]
Yet the tone of the moment held that plausible impossibility—why couldn't a broken bell, mended by dripping sapphire, call back the seas? [504]
As the rates quickened, Elandor sang a low chant, his voice earnest and unbroken despite the fragility of his devotion. [523]
The bell's surface began to glow, fractures sealing with veins of sapphire essence, rebuilding itself under his guidance. [539]
Sweat beaded on his brow, but he persisted, adjusting his spell to match the accelerating drips—now five per breath, then seven. [558]
The viaduct's hum grew louder, harmonizing with the bell's emerging tone. [568]
In that dawn-lit span, after the last fish had vanished, Elandor felt the cosmic imbalance waver. [582]
The rebuilt bell tolled once, a deep, resonant peal that echoed across the empty ocean. [595]
Waves stirred below, impossible yet plausible, as schools of spectral fish shimmered into existence, the first step toward restoration. [613]
His brittle devotion held, fortified by success, no longer so easily shattered. [623]
Elandor rose, the lukewarm mage transformed, having righted the scales through naive earnestness and precise understanding. [637]
The sapphire viaduct stood firm, dawn fully broken, heralding a new equilibrium. [647]
