In the drowned remnants of what was once a bustling metropolis, now a labyrinth of sunken city ruins where the plague had finally ebbed away like a receding tide, Elias dwelled in the twisting sewers that had become his philosophical sanctum. [38]
He was a wannabe philosopher, rationally rebellious against the surface dwellers who preached a sanitized version of history, their voices echoing down through grates as they rebuilt atop the wreckage. [67]
Elias's motivation burned steadily: to preserve ancient methods, those forgotten arts of precision and navigation that had guided humanity before the cataclysm, before the plague twisted everything into chaos. [96]
His tone was one of abrasive calm, a serene sarcasm that cut like a dull blade through the delusions of others. [117]
"Why rush to forget," he'd murmur to the dripping walls, "when the past ticks on beneath our feet?" [134]
The timeframe after the plague ends had brought a fragile peace, but also competing narratives: the official tale spun by the survivors above, claiming the sinking was divine retribution for hubris, and the whispered underground lore that blamed engineered folly, a botched attempt to control the seas. [184]
Elias rejected both with equal disdain, his rebellion rooted in reason, not rage. [196]
He sought evidence, something tangible to anchor his own narrative, one that honored the old ways without myth or blame. [215]
Deep in the sewers, where the ruins layered like forgotten epochs, he began his methodical descent through sedimentary layers, each stratum a chapter of buried time. [240]
The method was painstaking: sifting mud and silt, peeling back the compacted detritus of flooded streets, eroded buildings, and the plague's grim leavings—bones mingled with rusted relics. [267]
It was here, in this submerged archive, that Elias would agonize, his mind wrestling with doubts as his hands clawed deeper. [286]
Layer by layer, he uncovered fragments—a shard of porcelain, a corroded coin—but nothing that spoke to the ancient methods he yearned to revive. [308]
The competing narratives haunted him: the surface folk's pious fable painted the pre-plague era as sinful excess, while the sewer whispers accused shadowy elites of unleashing the flood deliberately. [337]
Elias agonized over them, his abrasive calm fracturing slightly as he muttered, "Fools above and fools below, both blind to the gears that truly turned our world." [363]
His rebellion was rational, a calculated defiance; he believed preserving the old navigational arts—star charts, compasses, chronometers—could prevent future disasters, not through prayer or conspiracy, but through empirical wisdom. [393]
Deeper he delved, through sedimentary layers thick with algae and the silt of centuries compressed into mere decades by the cataclysm's weight. [414]
Sweat mingled with the brackish water, his breaths measured and abrasive in their steadiness, like a philosopher dissecting fallacies amid ruin. [435]
Then, his fingers brushed something metallic, precise—a small, intricate cog, its teeth still sharp despite the encrusting sediment. [453]
He held it up to his lantern's flickering light: a seafarer’s chronometer cog, part of those ancient timepieces that once synchronized voyages across vast oceans, measuring longitude with mechanical poetry. [482]
This was it, a relic of the methods he sought to preserve, a tangible rebuttal to the competing narratives. [500]
But as he turned it in his palm, agony gripped him anew. [510]
Which story did it serve? [514]
The official narrative might claim it a symbol of hubris, a tool that tempted men to conquer seas they shouldn't have. [535]
The underground tale could twist it into evidence of elite sabotage, perhaps a chronometer tampered with to misguide fleets and trigger the floods. [558]
Elias agonized, his rationally rebellious mind rebelling against both, insisting on a third path: the cog as pure mechanism, a method to be studied, replicated, preserved for its intrinsic value. [587]
Through the sedimentary layers, he had unearthed not just an object, but a crossroads of thought. [602]
In his abrasive calm, he whispered to the shadows, "Let them compete; I'll forge the truth from what's left." [620]
Clutching the cog, he ascended back through the ruins, ready to challenge the narratives above and below, his philosophy no longer wannabe but forged in the depths. [647]
The plague had ended, but the real reconstruction began now, with ancient methods as his guide. [661]
