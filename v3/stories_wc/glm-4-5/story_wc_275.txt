Rhiannon slipped through the glass-domed enclosure, the desert heat trapped yet tamed by the transparent barrier that protected her desert roses. [20]
After the tower fell, chaos had reigned, but here, among the thorny beauties, she cultivated peace. [40]
Her father had been a bounty hunter, the most feared in the five provinces, but Rhiannon had chosen a different path, one that nurtured rather than captured. [70]
From a pocket of her linen tunic, she withdrew a scrap of fabric—weathered canvas and rough twine, all that remained of an airship ballast sandbag from her father's last expedition. [99]
Yet instead of using it as some hunters' trophy, she had repurposed it as a carrying pouch for seeds and cuttings. [120]
Rhiannon was senselessly perceptive, a trait that made her invaluable yet also a burden, as she noticed every withered petal, every drooping stem, every subtle shift in humidity within the dome. [161]
This perception served her greatest gift: inculcating plants with values, a method she had developed by focusing her energy and intention while touching each specimen. [190]
The roses responded to her touch, absorbing her tranquility, her resilience, her fierce desire to weave continuity through chaos. [219]
By the time she finished with a plant, its blossoms carried the essence of her intentions—courage, patience, hope—delivered through fragrant whispers to those who received them. [259]
Rhiannon believed that every living thing craved meaning, and in the fractured world left after the tower's fall, she provided anchor through her botanical artistry. [292]
Today, she moved to the central bed where her most prized specimens grew—desert roses that bloomed in shades impossible in nature, hues that reflected the values she had lovingly embedded. [336]
Her father had scoffed at her methods, unable to comprehend how she could sheathe her hunter-born instincts and instead nurture life. [362]
But Rhiannon had mastered what he never could: the engraved quiet, a state of being where silence became a tool rather than an absence, where stillness spoke volumes. [398]
In this state, she could hear the whispers of the plants, understand their needs, and guide their growth toward embodiments of human virtues. [431]
The dome itself seemed to breathe with her, condensation forming and dispersing like thoughts rising and falling in meditation. [460]
Outside, the desert stretched to the horizon, a landscape of harsh beauty that had been transformed by the tranquility she cultivated within. [492]
Rhiannon's visitors often spoke of the feeling that washed over them when entering her sanctuary—not just relief from the heat, but a sense of profound peace that belied the wild energy of her creations. [541]
They called her garden a tranquil blaze, a contradiction that perfectly described the experience of standing amid roses that seemed to embody both fierce survival and delicate beauty. [579]
Today she worked with a new cutting, focusing her intention of resilience as she wrapped the fragile stem in her airship scrap fabric. [606]
The sandbag material, once meant to weigh down a vessel of conquest, now protected a vessel of renewal. [632]
Rhiannon smiled as she sensed the plant already responding, its imperceptible vibrations aligning with her purpose. [660]
When the tower had fallen, taking with it the last remnants of central authority, many had determined that civilization itself would collapse next. [696]
But here in her glass-domed oasis, Rhiannon harvested not just flowers, but reminders of what humanity could be—connected, purposeful, beautiful even in harsh conditions. [739]
And as she moved between the rows, touching leaves, whispering encouragement, she knew that her greatest achievement was not in the roses themselves. [776]
It was in the continuation of goodness in a world that seemed determined to unravel, a thread of meaning woven through the tapestry of chaos. [813]
With practiced movements, she sheathed her pruning shears, another day's work complete, another step taken toward healing the fractured world one blossom at a time. [852]
