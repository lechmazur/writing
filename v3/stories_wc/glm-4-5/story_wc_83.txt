The geode crystal pulsed in Elias's hand, its fractured interior swirling with colors that shouldn't exist. [15]
He was a drone strike wedding survivor, the only one who had walked away from the ashes of what should have been the happiest day of his life. [34]
Now he lived in a floating observatory, suspended above the ruins of the city where his fiancée and fifty-seven others had perished. [52]
The observatory was his sanctuary and his prison, orbiting the wasteland that had once been home. [70]
Elias clutched the crystal tighter, feeling its intangibly tangible presence—a paradox that defied physics yet felt as real as his own heartbeat. [91]
He was on the hunt again, searching for where unused potential pools in the fractured landscape below. [108]
The geode was his compass, its unfiltered awakening had shown him the invisible currents of possibility that flowed through the broken world. [128]
Through perturbation theory, Elias calculated the coordinates of the largest potential pool he had ever detected. [146]
The observatory's systems had overloaded an hour ago, and now, while circuit breakers cooled, he had a narrow window before the shields would come back online. [172]
This was his chance to reach the surface undetected. [180]
The bleak exhilaration of his mission coursed through him—a strange cocktail of grief and purpose that had become his constant companion. [202]
Elias descended in the observation pod, a small craft designed for brief excursions to the surface. [223]
The geode crystal glowed brighter as he approached the coordinates, its light casting strange shadows on the pod's interior. [246]
He landed softly in what had once been a public garden, now overgrown with mutated vegetation and twisted metal structures. [269]
The crystal's unfiltered awakening had revealed that this place, where so many had dreamed and loved, had become a reservoir of unused potential. [295]
Elias stepped out, the air thick with the scent of ozone and decay. [310]
He followed the crystal's pull, moving through the wreckage with the confidence of someone who had nothing left to lose. [331]
The hunt led him to a collapsed amphitheater, its stone benches cracked but still recognizable. [350]
In the center, where performances had once enchanted crowds, the potential pooled like liquid light, visible only through the crystal's influence. [376]
Elias knelt and placed the geode at the heart of the pool, watching as the crystal began to absorb the dormant energy. [397]
The intangibly tangible nature of both the potential and the crystal created a resonance that vibrated through his entire being. [419]
Through perturbation theory, he had predicted this would happen—the convergence of lost possibilities creating a new kind of power. [443]
As the last of the potential flowed into the crystal, Elias felt a shift in the world around him. [463]
The geode had changed, its colors now deeper, its presence more substantial. [480]
He was no longer just a drone strike wedding survivor; he was becoming something else, something forged from loss and possibility. [502]
The bleak exhilaration intensified as he realized what he had accomplished. [517]
Back in the floating observatory, while circuit breakers still cooled, Elias examined the transformed crystal. [536]
It now contained the hopes and dreams of everyone who had ever gathered in that amphitheater, a condensed reservoir of human potential. [561]
He had found where unused potential pools, and more importantly, he had learned how to harvest it. [582]
The unfiltered awakening had shown him the way forward—not just for himself, but perhaps for what remained of humanity. [604]
Elias smiled, a rare expression that felt foreign on his face. [619]
The hunt had been successful, but it was only the beginning. [634]
There were other pools to find, other reservoirs of dormant possibility waiting to be awakened. [653]
The geode crystal would be his guide, its intangibly tangible nature the key to unlocking a future that had seemed impossible. [676]
Through perturbation theory, he would calculate the next location, then the next, until he had gathered enough potential to make a difference. [702]
The bleak exhilaration of his purpose sustained him as the floating observatory's systems began to hum back to life. [724]
Elias looked out at the ruined world below, no longer seeing just devastation, but infinite possibility waiting to be discovered. [748]
He was ready for the next hunt. [755]
