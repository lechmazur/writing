<story>Eleanor had always been a forgiving skeptic, willing to entertain extraordinary claims yet demanding extraordinary proof. [16]

The discovery of Arthur's substitute body three weeks ago had created the first cleft in certainty for her scientific mind. [42]

Even now, she held the peculiar iridescent luminescence of the changeling's baby tooth that had fallen from the false corpse's mouth, defying all rational explanation. [70]

As Eleanor navigated the intricate hedge maze behind the old Wembley estate, she yearned for answers that would restore her worldview or transform it entirely. [99]

The secret garden at the maze's center had remained hidden for decades, its ancient plants thriving despite the neglect that had befallen the rest of the estate grounds. [132]

With her shrewdly innocent approach to the impossible, Eleanor appeared to the gardener's boy as merely an eccentric lady collecting herbs, all while her mind constructed elaborate theories about dimensional barriers. [174]

The garden embodied nostalgic innovation, with Victorian-era botanical engineering giving rise to plants that bloomed upside down or glowed with captured firefly light. [205]

"Bone setting must work across realms too," she whispered, recalling her grandmother's teachings about how mending broken bones sometimes required touching the spirit. [239]

Eleanor had inherited this peculiar skill from generations of healers, though she'd only ever practiced it on humans and animals, never on what might lie between worlds. [276]

Arthur had been different for seven years, since the childhood fever that should have killed him but instead left him somehow too perfect, too observant, yet less himself. [310]

Eleanor, ever forgiving, had never blamed him for the changes that followed his mysterious recovery, though she mourned the loss of the boy who once called her "Ellie." [342]

She arranged the tooth carefully at the center of a circle of moonpetals that had just begun to open in the garden's perpetual twilight. [370]

Her motivation had evolved beyond simple rescue; Eleanor wanted to turn mistakes into constellations, mapping her errors in understanding into patterns that could guide others through similar impossible choices. [411]

As her fingers moved through the precise motions of bone setting, she called not just to Arthur but to the realm where his authentic self was presumably held captive. [448]

The tooth began to vibrate, humming with a sound that awakened Eleanor's deepest childhood memories, before logic had taught her to dismiss such sensations as imagination. [485]

 suddenly the garden's edges blurred between what was real and what might be possible. [502]

A figure emerged from nothingness—neither child nor adult, neither Arthur nor not-Arthur, but something impossibly in between that reached out with a hand that was simultaneously flesh and shadow. [542]

"My Ellie," it whispered, with a voice that contained echoes of the seven-year-old Arthur she remembered and something ancient and unknowable. [569]

Eleanor's fingers moved instinctively, practicing bone setting on the air between them, hoping to align realities as she might align a fractured limb. [600]

"Where have you been?" she asked, her skepticism finally and fully yielding to wonder. [616]

"Building," the figure answered simply, "turning mistakes into constellations." [631]

In that impossible garden behind the hedges, Eleanor discovered that forgiveness was more powerful than skepticism, and that the most profound innovations sometimes required looking backward with new eyes. [677]

The tooth dissolved into light as it fell from the figure's smile, completing the exchange and returning something more precious than certainty—renewal through mystery. [712]

Eleanor reached out to touch her friend, ready to understand whatever came next in their newly rewritten story. [733]

"My bones need setting," Arthur said with a vulnerability that seemed both ancient and shrewdly innocent in its calculated display. [761]

"And I," Eleanor replied, "have been preparing my whole life without knowing it." [781]

The garden around them shifted, the maze walls dissolving and reforming according to patterns only Arthur could perceive after his time in that other realm. [817]

As their hands joined fully, one human and one not quite yet, the boundary between worlds softened enough for Eleanor to glimpse the constellation they would become together. [859]
