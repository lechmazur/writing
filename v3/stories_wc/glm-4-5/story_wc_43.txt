I begin my morning rounds at Cloudcrest Hospice, the radiant haven above the clouds where patients spend their final days with breathtaking views rather than beeping monitors. [24]
The blood work came back yesterday for Mr. Anders, confirming what we already knew—his remaining time is measured in hours now, not weeks. [31]
As his music therapist, I bring my guitar and the small velvet pouch containing the most unusual therapy tool in my kit: a piece of his broken vinyl record from the 1960s. [30]
He'd been carrying it since his son accidentally broke the album during their last visit, a painful memory he couldn't fix before his health deteriorated. [28]
Today, I'll help reunify him with that past through the music that fragment represents. [18]
My colleagues often comment on my demeanor, calling me "serene," though I simply maintain what matters most in this work: a decisively kind presence for those transitioning from life. [32]
The scent of hope permeates the sterile room whenever I enter, a peculiar mixture of Mrs. Anders' lavender lotion and the cedar chest where she stores her husband's mementos. [30]
This aroma intensifies as I arrange the chairs in semi-circle, anticipating the family's arrival for what must be a flawless goodbye. [24]
Mr. Anders had been specific—no tears, no profound statements about life, just his family and his music. [21]
"My last dance," he'd called it, and in the pulsing stillness of hospice, dances are our specialty. [18]
When the Anders family arrives, I place the vinyl fragment on the small table beside the bed. [16]
Mrs. Anders touches it gently, her finger tracing the crack that divided their world before all of it might end. [22]
"In his depression after the accident," she tells me, "he'd sit for hours hymning the mundane—finding melodies in the hum of the refrigerator, the rhythm of rain against windows." [30]
My fingers find the guitar strings, playing softly the tune from that broken record, the one his son never heard him play completely. [22]
I understand now why this piece of vinyl matters—not for what it played when intact, but for what it represents: a childhood memory his son carries, a father's love held in fragments. [30]
The room falls into that characteristic pulsing stillness of transition spaces, where breathing becomes the only metronome counting what's left. [24]
I play louder, not to fill the silence but to honor it. [11]
Mr. Anders opens his eyes, the scent of hope apparently more powerful than medication today. [14]
His son kneels beside the bed, hands cupped to receive the broken record piece. [14]
"I'll fix it, Dad," he whispers, "when you're feeling better." [14]
We all know better times aren't coming, so I keep playing, creating the bridge between understanding and acceptance. [19]
In this radiant haven above the clouds, reunification isn't about physical presence but about connecting fragments of love, memory, and music into something whole again. [26]
When Mr. Anders finally closes his eyes, his son still holds the vinyl piece as if it's a holy relic rather than broken plastic. [22]
I continue playing softly, hymning the mundane beauty that exists even in last moments—and it is decisively kind, I think, that we can call this goodbye flawless in its imperfection. [28]
The scent of hope lingers as I pack my guitar, the pulsing stillness enfolding the Anders family in their first moments without him. [22]
In hospice work, we don't hope for miracles but for meaning—which is why, as I leave Cloudcrest, I whisper gratitude for being allowed to witness such ordinary magic. [26]
Some days the radiant haven above the clouds doesn't need to be a physical place at all, but rather the space between notes where love lives on. [23]
