Milo lived in the damp sewer tunnels beneath Poseidonis, a city now mostly submerged after the Great Plague. [21]
As a wannabe philosopher, he had chosen this humble dwelling not out of necessity but principle, rejecting the gleaming spires above that housed those who had chosen to forget the lessons of history. [33]
Since the plague ended thirty years ago, the survivors had rebuilt society on the foundation that the past was poison, and ancient methods the source of all suffering that had nearly extinguished humanity. [31]
Milo, being rationally rebellious, questioned this narrative through carefully constructed arguments rather than emotional tantrums, presenting logical refutations to anyone who would listen during rare trips to the surface world. [34]
Each day, he would descend through sedimentary layers of what once were streets and pathways, often chest-deep in the murky waters that now claimed most of the sunken city ruins. [31]
This exploration was both his research and his rebellion, cataloging artifacts the new world had deemed dangerous but which he preserved in his underground sanctuary. [25]
Today, his fingers brushed against something unusual in the centuries of accumulated silt: a perfectly preserved seafarer's chronometer cog. [24]
The tiny brass wheel glinted in his lantern light, its teeth still precise despite decades underwater, numbered markings still visible beneath the patina of time. [28]
This discovery would force him to agonize over competing narratives that had defined his existence since he'd come of age in this post-plague world. [24]
The Council taught that such instruments represented humanity's fatal hubris, the belief that precise measurement could conquer natural forces that should remain mysterious and respected. [28]
Yet Milo's rational mind could not dismiss the engineering genius required to create such precision without modern technology, the mathematical beauty in its design. [26]
"They condemn what they don't understand," he muttered to the dripping pipes, his voice maintaining its characteristic abrasive calm despite the turmoil in his thoughts. [28]
He did not shout or rage when faced with ignorance; instead, he dissected it with the same precision he used to clean relics from the past. [22]
He pocketed the chronometer cog with deliberate movements, his motivation clear: to preserve ancient methods not merely for nostalgia but for the knowledge they offered of mathematical principles and mechanical truths. [32]
Above him, in what remained of the world's tallest skyscraper before the plague changed everything, the Council would soon be discussing another destruction of "dangerous knowledge." [30]
Milo ran his thumb over the cog's teeth, each one meticulously crafted by hands long dead, by methods the modern world had deemed inferior and useless. [27]
The journey back through sedimentary layers of the sunken city required concentration, for the waters had shifted overnight, creating new passages while sealing old ones. [27]
His rationally rebellious nature had led him here, trusting evidence over dogma, even when evidence meant centuries-old brass retrieved from layers of collective forgetting. [26]
The city above might have forgotten how to navigate by stars or measure time with mechanical precision, but Milo would remember, and he would teach others if given the chance. [29]
In the abrasive calm of his underground sanctuary, surrounded by the ghosts of a civilization wiped clean by plague and then by choice, the philosopher wannabe made his choice. [29]
The chronometer cog was not merely an object but a question posed across centuries, and he would answer not with destruction but with preservation. [22]
For what was wisdom if not the respectful compilation of all methods, ancient and modern, dredged up through layers of sediment and time? [22]
As Milo placed the seafarer's chronometer cog among his other treasures, he knew the competing narratives of his world would not be resolved in his lifetime. [27]
But one day, someone else would agonize over the destruction of knowledge, and they might find his preserved treasures, continuing the rationally rebellious work of memory against forgetfulness. [27]
Milo's fingers traced the brass cog once more before turning to his notes, where he had documented similar finds, creating alternative histories through sedimentary layers of evidence. [25]
The wannabe philosopher knew his battle was quiet, fought not with weapons but with preservation, not with grand speeches but with the abrasive calm of someone who trusts reasoning over revolution. [26]
Above, Poseidonis gleamed in the artificial light of progress, while below, in the sewers and sunken ruins, the true chronometer of human knowledge continued its silent turning. [24]
Tomorrow, he would continue his agonizing work, moving through sedimentary layers of the fallen city, seeking more artifacts to preserve against the competing narratives that sought to erase human complexity. [29]
What others discarded as dangerous or useless, Milo preserved with the meticulous care of a conservator, knowing that someday the wisdom contained in these ancient methods would once again be needed by humanity. [30]
