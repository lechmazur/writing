<story>The turbines cast slow shadows over the farmhouse, like clock hands that forgot their point. [15]
I live here now, after the happiness mandate, where cheer has measurable wattage and fines. [30]
I am a blank-faced performer, certified, graded, and broadcast when required. [41]
They like my neutrality; it looks like victory in certain lighting. [52]
The inspectors say I am morally ambiguous, which plays well on state screens. [65]
Ambiguous means available, or so my manager smiles when he counts the tokens. [78]
There is a dried flower bouquet on the mantel, brittle as paper breath. [91]
It came from the funeral that the city renamed a Gratitude Transition. [103]
I want to cultivate lightness in grief, not happiness, which skims like insect wings. [117]
Lightness can carry; happiness is ballast disguised as song. [126]
Morning is my work, recorded for the mandate channel, narrated like apocalypse for a spoon. [141]
I begin with the sink, dramatically narrating mundane tasks so the algorithm hears zest. [155]
Behold, a dish, I declare, wet crescent of responsibility, slipping toward redemption. [167]
Behold, a sponge, I say, valor rising from pores. [176]
The feed blinks hearts; the inspectors annotate; the turbines keep carving their breeze. [189]
Between takes, silence saunters in, thin as a foal, and stands by the stove. [203]
I am trying to make a remade hush, one that earns its floorboards. [216]
Not the hush they punish, which is seditious, but the hush they cannot measure. [230]
For this, I whittle in the evenings when the turbines are just bones against dusk. [245]
I shave curls from orchard scraps and make small things that do not expect applause. [260]
A spoon for the absence, a bird for the window, a cameo of nobody. [274]
I do not smile; the blank face is my costume and my insurance. [287]
Children from the ridge come to watch and learn compliance postures. [298]
I teach them angles of light that read as joy without needing the organ underneath. [313]
This is the ambiguous part, because I am paid, and their parents need the tokens. [328]
But I also teach them the pause between breath and speech, which is not flaggable. [343]
We name that pause our remade hush, and we let it carry the dead. [357]
The bouquet listens; petals fall like clipped syllables, making small brown shrapnel around the mantel. [372]
Once, an inspector arrived unannounced, nasal with duty and the turbine whine in his suit. [387]
He asked for evidence of happiness and a live narration of laundry. [399]
I held up the dried flower bouquet and announced a saga of stains and weather. [414]
Behold, I said, the shirt that caught the rain, a hero wrung by circumstance. [428]
Behold, I said, the socks that marched through mud like medics. [439]
He nodded, his pen relieved, while the turbines thumped their giant applause beyond the barley. [454]
When he asked who the bouquet mourned, I said gratitude, which is always perishable. [468]
He left satisfied, and I felt the familiar vacancy where victory should sit. [481]
Night drew an outline around the farmhouse, and the wind bent the barley like kneeling. [496]
I put a child to bed on the couch while her parents sorted permits. [510]
She asked if the turbines make the dead dizzy; I said they are just arms. [525]
Arms do not hold forever; they circle and release; we practice the release. [538]
In the morning, my feed needed content, and grief needed a vessel that was not surveillance. [554]
I staged a lesson at the sink, but we turned off the microphones. [567]
We narrated with our hands only, dramatic arcs of plate and towel, crescendos of rinse. [582]
Between gestures, the hush gathered, remade by intention, brave enough to stand upright. [595]
It held until the turbines lost their rhythm and had to start again. [608]
I placed the dried bouquet on the table and let the child take a stem. [623]
She thumbed the petals, learning how weightless a remembrance becomes when it accepts being brittle. [638]
Then I whittled a small flute from peach wood, pith bright as a wound. [652]
We did not play it, because sound is a ladder, and we needed ground. [666]
We left it on the sill to learn waiting, like a bird with no sky. [681]
Afternoon shimmered; the inspectors scrolled past; we ate barley bread without ceremony. [693]
The child slept again, and the turbines kept time for a calendar nobody trusted. [707]
I swept the shavings, narrated them as comets, then stopped speaking until silence learned my outline. [723]
When night came, I turned to the camera and delivered one true line. [736]
Behold, I said, not joy, but lightness, which is grief without the anchor. [749]
Then I let the blank face hold, and the remade hush held with it. [763]
Outside, the wind kept working, but inside, something finally did not. [774]</story>
