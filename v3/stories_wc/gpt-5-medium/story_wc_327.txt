<story>At dusk I arrived among towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes, carrying a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed. [22]
I am the copper-veined storyteller they sent, quietly articulate because the valley favors words that do not bruise the air. [42]
My task is to translate texture into sound, to gather the last voice left across the death of a language. [62]
The elders claimed the canyon remembered stories as grain, scar, and dust, and that only echo could read such braille. [82]
I found a notch in the cliff where sound did not disperse but turned, a tunnel of echoes that swallowed my name. [104]
In that hush I pressed the flawed diamond rumored to be cursed against the wall and felt a pulse like patient rain. [126]
The gem had a feathered fracture, and through it the stone ribs of the canyon trembled with unread syllables. [145]
I needed more than touch, so I climbed a ridge where swifts were schooling, ready to harness their choreography for listening. [166]
I watched through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight until the wind stitched a grammar between wings and cliff. [188]
Each turn of their bodies mapped a ridge, each dive pressed a pause, and the canyon answered with careful returns. [208]
I lowered the diamond into the echo-tunnel again, aligning the fracture with the flight, so the canyon's textures could speak. [228]
The first sound was a rasp like bark scraped by winter, and it resolved into a word for water lost on salt. [250]
I repeated it, quietly articulate, and the tunnel offered another, thinner than silk, the name of shade that refuses ownership. [270]
The language was dying, not from silence but from overuse, its words worn smooth by barter, prayer, and apology. [289]
I could hear the wear as a fuzz at the edge of every echo, and I knew my time was narrow. [310]
The last speakers had traded their vowels for grain; the canyon kept only the textures, which I had promised to translate. [331]
I gathered reed, cloth, and bone to build small listeners that rode the updrafts like kites, each tuned to a separate scar. [353]
The birds circled them, teaching them to bank and wait, and their shadows braided the ground into a metronome of attention. [374]
Through this choreography I coaxed the tunnel to widen, until it held not only sound but the faintest trivia of touch. [395]
The wall spoke of heat trapped in summer bones, of cold that cracked a priest's oath, of blood dried to powder. [416]
I translated texture into sound, then sound into a braid of notes, each note a salvaged word weighted with its own erosion. [438]
The flawed diamond rumored to be cursed warmed in my palm, as if remembering a throat it had once betrayed. [458]
I ignored the fear, because a curse is only a contract without punctuation, and I had learned to supply the pauses. [479]
As the echo-maps deepened, visions flickered: traders counting lies on knuckles, a child naming dust storms, lovers encrypting tenderness into weaving. [500]
The canyon resisted when I reached for law and war, and the birds broke pattern, scattering like torn script across the sky. [522]
I retreated, quietly articulate with apology, and fed the listeners my breath, inviting the tunnel to choose the order of testimony. [543]
It answered by folding itself around the diamond, and I felt a thirst like dry ink, demanding payment in voice. [563]
I offered my name, the small one used for travel, and the curse took it, leaving a ringing cavity where it had perched. [586]
In exchange the canyon settled, and a flood of textures became choir, a treaty recited by stone on behalf of the voiceless. [608]
I set the notes to spiral around the bone towers, and the flock returned to curtail the escape of fugitive meanings. [629]
The recording was never ink on page, but a moving concord that rose at dawn and nested in the evening's cold seams. [651]
Travelers learned to ask permission of the echoes, and the echoes, pleased, taught them how to carry questions without bruising them. [672]
I stayed, copper-veined storyteller without a travel-name, tending the listeners and the birds, because endings need caretakers as much as beginnings do. [694]
When storms came, I set the diamond in a niche and let rain score the rock, then translated its staccato into shelter. [716]
When drought stretched thin, I listened for the soft syllable of dust, turning it into a music that eased the cattle's gulps. [738]
Sometimes the curse flickered, wanting more, but I fed it only the names that had already died, and it quieted. [758]
Thus the canyon's tunnel of echoes became a school where texture learned to sing, and the dead language learned to travel again. [780]</story>
