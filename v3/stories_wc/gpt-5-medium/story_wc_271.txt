<story>An arboretum perched on a seaside cliff breathed salt and sap into the wind that combed its glass roofs. [19]
Below, an automated lighthouse blinked, a metronome installed after the last lighthouse keeper locked the door and let his boots echo away. [41]
Rafi worked mornings, quietly talented with grafts and trellises, scrubbing fog from panes so the citrus could drink the shy sun. [62]
He had chosen the job for its patient tasks and the way the ocean said nothing false. [79]
In his pocket traveled a crumpled photograph, the single thing that made it through the heat and dust of a drone strike at his wedding. [104]
He did not take it out often, because the bodies crowded the edges when he unfolded it. [121]
Some days the whir of the vent fans made him freeze, a skein of air snarling into the old pitch of rotors. [143]
He knew what to do, learned through somatic markers from a counselor who had only soft chairs and a sharper memory than he wanted. [167]
He named sensations, put them where he could see them, and waited until they shrank like snails under a fingertip's shadow. [188]
Then he would move again, trimming the madrona, sketching notes to himself in pencil that left the least arrogant mark. [208]
Tourists came slowly after the storms, asking where the lighthouse keeper had gone, and Rafi would point at the blinking eye and say, retirement. [232]
The truth was simpler, a switch thrown, a salary gone, another human unfastened from a railing and a view that had held him upright. [256]
Rafi swept the fallen petals and thought about what to add rather than what to erase. [272]
He wanted to anchor optimism in realism, to plant species that would survive the hotter years yet still bloom like small promises. [294]
He had begun collecting seeds that took wind as a partner, not an enemy, and teaching interns how to hear the leaves sweating. [317]
There was a girl named Leda who pruned with the patience of a tide and spoke as if she were waking a sleeping fern. [341]
He recognized how quietly talented she was, her hands tipping towards solutions before she could explain their reasoning. [359]
One afternoon they found a gull tangled in fishing line near the cliff path, its eye fixed like an unblinking planet. [380]
Rafi heard the drone of a training helicopter offshore and the white noise wrapped his ribs in wire. [398]
He felt his body freeze, the memory loading like an old program, stuttering frames of fire and sugar and a bride's gold dress. [421]
Leda spoke the gull's pain into a task list, and he followed her voice back across the bridge of numbering. [441]
Cut this knot, hold here, breathe, and he did, noting through somatic markers the loosening in his shoulders like a tide pulling away its claim. [466]
When the gull rose, a ragged kite that somehow found direction, he felt inside his sternum a pearl of stillness, weightless and strong. [489]
He kept working by that feeling, a compass that did not promise safety, only bearings, and the gardening went straighter for it. [511]
Storm season returned, which meant more glass to tighten and more visitors who believed the ocean could be commanded by an app. [533]
He met a woman who had been the last lighthouse keeper's niece, carrying a box of logbooks that smelled of diesel and kelp. [556]
She asked if the arboretum could host an exhibit, and when Rafi saw the tide tables inked by hand he felt respect grow vines. [580]
They cleared a corridor and hung the logbooks above the succulent wing, pairing each entry with a plant that shared its temperament. [602]
Visitors traced the handwriting and then the veins in the leaves, seeing weather become choice, choice become care, care become shelter. [623]
One evening, after closing, the niece found Rafi sitting by the glass, the photograph open like a wound that had decided to scar. [646]
He told her, not heroics, only how the air burned and how strangers carried him, and how a year later he chose a job that required watering. [673]
He said he was learning to build rooms that storms could enter without wrecking, and that optimism meant doors, not denial. [694]
She nodded, and asked about the citrus, and he showed her the new grafts, the seams neat and brave as stitches. [715]
When the moon rose, the lighthouse blinked its unmanned blessing, and the ocean lifted its shoulders and settled like a giant animal. [737]
Rafi folded the photograph once more, the paper new only in the way his hands now held it, steady as a trellis in wind. [761]
He slept in the caretaker's room, where the walls hummed with pumps and the plants breathed, and the next morning he woke with work ready to meet him. [789]</story>
