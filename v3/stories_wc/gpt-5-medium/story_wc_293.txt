I am the bridge-song fiddler who plays where crossings tremble, and today I play for a disappearance. [17]
It is after the hitchhiker vanishes, on a mountain scenic pullout whose guardrail stares like a tired eyelid. [35]
Wind frays the tourist maps, traffic shushes below, and luminous disbelief braids itself through my bow hair. [52]
I came here dynamically observant, tuned to edges, because he whistled a code between thumb and chipped tooth. [70]
He joked he chose me for my bridges, because I could stitch cliffs that refused to address each other. [89]
Then he slid from my passenger seat like mist, leaving only a door click and a promise shaped maybe. [108]
I set my fiddle case on the hood and recount the eight meanest turns we climbed to reach this shelf. [128]
Recount the two coffees, the three names he tried on like jackets, the five times he looked back downvalley. [147]
A construction shroud trembles over the overlook pavilion, a fabric city of warnings stitched to aluminum bones. [164]
In it, a secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters, shapes forming when gusts align stencils like conspirators. [181]
Arrows of paint appear only in motion, pointing between slats to a niche where something glints under leaf-litter. [199]
I kneel and lift a wet-plate collodion glass flake, its emulsion peeling like a moon shedding languages. [216]
On the shard is a face ghosted by time, a jawline I know better than the key of D. [235]
He is there younger and laced with silver cracks, a negative begging to be forgiven by light. [252]
Pixelated amnesty, he called it once, forgiveness rendered in blocks, the past blurred until only motion survives. [269]
He swore the mountains ran a ledger, and that images, film to phone, were the currency that canceled debts. [288]
Bring the right note, the right face, and the cameras would blink, and a border would forget its own name. [308]
I did not believe, until disbelief became luminous, trembling with proof pressed between glass and ghost. [324]
The highway hisses a verdict, but my hands vote otherwise, and the bow finds the bridge like a homing bird. [344]
I reel the first phrase across the pullout, a ribbon for cars to drive under and emerge altered. [362]
The tune is a recount of every breath he borrowed, minor at the edges, major where he smiled sideways. [381]
Wind answers, tugging the scaffold wrap into alignment, arrow meeting arrow, the map sketching toward the bridge below. [399]
I follow with careful boots and a heart making drum corps noises, past orange cones and sleeping equipment. [417]
Under the bridge, river light pixelates through latticework, turning my reflection into a witness with missing squares. [434]
He stands where shadow and sheen meet, more rumor than man, and the glass flake in my pocket burns cold. [454]
You found the ledger, he says without speaking, the words arriving as ripples in the bars my bow draws. [473]
The debt was old, he had been told, older than his first lie about names, older than asphalt. [491]
He vanished to spare me the tally, trading himself for pixelated amnesty, and now the system is listening. [509]
I play the measure that forgives, not erasing but resolving, and the glass in my pocket starts to clarify. [528]
Emulsion knits, silver threads pulling taut, and the face becomes present tense, no longer an absence posing as history. [547]
River mist beads on my fiddle, every drop a votive, and the sheeted scaffolds take up a soft applause. [566]
He steps toward me, each pixel resolving into grain, each grain into lines a lens might have once caressed. [585]
You did not have to, I hear him say, but I did, I answer, to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never". [607]
My answer folds into the river and skates the trusses, and the mountain ledger hesitates, then signs a receipt. [626]
The receipt is a warmth where his arm meets mine, a pressure not possible under any normal accounting. [644]
I laugh a little, a bridge laughing, and the bow keeps writing, because the system reads music as policy. [663]
Together we climb back toward the pullout, the scaffold map now still, its secret spent, its fabric at ease. [682]
Traffic returns with its brazen memoirs, ravens comment, and the horizon melts into squares of pale approvals. [699]
I am still dynamically observant, counting what remains, but my counting now tends toward futures rather than losses. [717]
He asks for one more tune, and I give him the bridge-song that first found him, now untrembling, now ours. [737]
The day keeps its light, disbelief keeps its glitter, and the ledger closes, if only until another crossing. [755]
