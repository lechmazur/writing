<story>After the anesthesia wears off, I wake beneath a canopy of cold trees that burn in a light my skin cannot name. [22]
The ultraviolet forest hums with a color that does not exist until it touches scars and makes them glow like confession. [43]
I feel displaced, but rooted the way a graft is rooted, uncertain which sap now runs in me. [61]
My hands find the pewter mask strap looped around my wrist, a leftover tether from the clinic hut downhill. [80]
They said it would keep the dressing on; I kept it because it keeps the dream on a leash I can pull. [102]
I brace on an elbow and the world spins like a compass dropped into a field of hidden magnets. [121]
Proprioception sings in me, louder than pain, a set of angles mapping ribs, tendons, and the tilt of my jaw. [141]
They call it proprioceptively enhanced, the gift I did not ask for, the way I can feel where I am before I arrive. [164]
It makes falling safer and standing unforgiving, because there is no lie between gravity and a body that knows itself. [184]
I survived enhanced interrogation by listening to sensations no one else could hear, a private morse in tendon twitches. [203]
When the lights flashed and the questions came, I wove answers out of muscle flinch and breath timing and counted heartbeats. [224]
Now I use the same method, remembering through trauma responses, plucking memory from the reflex that once kept it hidden. [244]
Every leaf here fluoresces a letter when my shadow passes, a scripture of ultraviolet penance translated by skin, not eyes. [264]
The forest is a cathedral designed by refugees of science and faith, and I am both its pilgrim and specimen. [284]
They brought me here because numbers bloom where apologies are honest, and I am seeking the mathematics of mercy. [303]
If I can find it, I might learn when to stop the turn of the screw before a soul fractures. [323]
I stand, the pewter mask strap whispering as it brushes bark, and the trees answer with a chorus of faint equations. [344]
Symbols rise in the air like gnats, arranging themselves around my breathing pattern, aligning with the shake I cannot hide. [364]
The algorithm demands honesty from the body, so I step deeper until the undergrowth paints my shins with cobalt fire. [384]
I remember the room where they strapped the mask, how pewter buckles gleamed like little moons, and how I left myself. [405]
I remember the lie I told to save a name, and the scream I did not let out until the sirens. [426]
My chest tightens and the forest flares, each trunk veined with ultraviolet as if remorse were a river inside wood. [446]
I brace again, palms on dirt, sensing the torque that runs from shoulder to hip like a drawn bow. [465]
The equations reach into that line and pluck a fraction, the ratio of intention to harm, simplified by the scrape of bark. [487]
I write with no pen, only breath, assigning constants to thresholds my body knows, angles where pain changes flavor. [506]
There is a point at which a person must brace, and that point counts as infinite cost, a wall the function cannot cross. [529]
Mercy begins where that wall first appears, earlier than cruelty thinks, a margin wide enough for a name to survive. [549]
The forest accepts this, letters fading to stems, and in their place a path brightens like bone under a skin of night. [571]
I knot the pewter mask strap around a branch as a boundary marker, a limit I am sworn not to exceed again. [593]
The metal warms, and a ripple passes through the leaves, like applause shared by beings who photosynthesize regret. [611]
I follow the path, proprioceptively mapping my intentions, testing each step against the formula the forest and I composed together. [631]
A caretaker waits in a clearing, her robe the black of unprinted pages, her voice gentle enough to keep the past walking. [653]
She does not ask for confession, only for proof, and I offer the theorem as a breath held and then released. [674]
The trees dim to normal green for a heartbeat, a kindness that says the lesson will not always scorch. [693]
But the ultraviolet penance is not punishment; it is calibration, a way to keep the living from becoming instruments. [712]
I have been an instrument, a flute played by the wind of fear, and now I ask to be wood again. [733]
The caretaker nods as if to say roots can grow in a displaced heart, given light in the spectrum where truth appears. [755]
I leave a copy of the rule etched on bark, not words but angles, a geometry anyone can feel when they must. [777]
Then I turn toward the valley, toward the ones still turning screws, carrying a forest inside me that refuses to be silent. [799]</story>
