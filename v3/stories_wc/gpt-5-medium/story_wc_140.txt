<story>On the docks, where the city stacks its cargo like secrets, I walk without a name through steel alleys. [19]
The towering labyrinth of shipping containers is my neighborhood and my memory palace, both rusted by salt and shuffled by cranes. [40]
In this port city, paperwork moves faster than tides, and one sheet once announced that I had stopped existing. [59]
The death certificate error made me a survivor of my own erasure, a ghost unclaimed by statistics and relatives. [78]
People say I filter reality differently, as if my eyes are sieves and their eyes are pitchers. [95]
Maybe that is true, because what I want is not truth but the texture of memories, coarse and fine like rope. [116]
I gather them by collecting fragments of overheard stories, the way stevedores gather spilled grain with bent shovels. [134]
Across the rhythm of tides, the port speaks in clanks and low vowels, telling me where to search next. [153]
At night, the water glows with oily constellations, and I walk the catwalks tracing their mirrored sky across the corrugated walls. [174]
The guards forget me because their clipboards say I am gone, and the cranes forget me because I move like a shadow. [196]
From the vents of a refrigerated unit, I heard two cleaners whisper about a widow who claimed an insurance fortune. [216]
They said the doctor was sloppy, the clerk hasty, the death too quiet for a man who never stopped arguing with the sea. [239]
Their words slide into my pockets, and I layer them with other scraps I have rescued from the rust. [258]
One scrap is a label from a poison bottle, sun-faded but legible, wedged under a magnet in a foreman office. [278]
It has a skull and a name I half recognize, an import line matching the container stack where I sometimes sleep. [299]
When I touch the paper, my fingertips taste bitter, the way lies do when you first remember telling them. [318]
I was poisoned once, I think, or nearly, and the certificate recorded the attempt as success because the clerk feared overtime. [339]
My widow would have been glad to bury me with a stamp, but the ocean coughed me back onto the quay. [360]
The problem with surviving bureaucracy is that it believes its own fiction, and so everyone else believes it too. [379]
Erased histories thrive here, crated and numbered, shipped outward or inward depending on who pays for the forgetting. [397]
To find mine, I listen for gaps in sentences, silences with fingerprints, and I follow them between the red and blue corridors. [419]
A night mechanic tells a joke about a man who drowned on paper and walked home in rubber boots, and nobody laughs. [441]
He looks at me sideways, and I know he knows me, but I have no name to return to his look. [462]
Instead I show him the label and the import line, and he rubs his thumb across the skull as if polishing judgment. [484]
He says the shipment was medical supplies diverted to a private warehouse upland, and that a widow supervised the inventory personally. [505]
Her name collects in my mouth like iron, but I still cannot say it, because the certificate made it illegal for me to remember. [529]
What I can do is walk, and layer steps over the map I keep inside, a palimpsest etched by cranes and currents. [551]
Across the rhythm of tides, I return to the same stack where the label points, and I wait for her car. [572]
She arrives in mourning colors that have faded into commerce, counting boxes with a clerk whose pen scratches like a small animal. [594]
I step from the shadows and watch recognition unbutton her throat; the world sifts through me, and I filter reality differently again. [616]
I say nothing about the certificate, only that I came to return something she lost, and I hold out the label. [637]
Her hand trembles, not for me but for the skull that proves a route, and she whispers that the bottle was never opened. [660]
I know better; the bitter memory on my fingers returns, bringing with it the taste of hospital light and gulls. [680]
I tell her the ocean kept my name since the doctors refused to, and it returns names only when paid in fear. [702]
She reaches for a phone, but the clerk has already walked away, because no witness wants their own records to unravel. [723]
I place the label on a crate like a small verdict and leave, letting her choose whether to inventory truth or keep the ledger balanced. [748]
The tides pull me along the aisles, and the city stacks its cargo again, layering new stories over the old until morning. [770]
I am not a man with a name, only a listener, and the erased histories keep speaking if I keep walking. [791]</story>
