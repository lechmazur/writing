<story>I wake in the greenhouse dusk, where sand whispers against the glass like moths searching for a false moon. [19]
I am a nostalgic android caretaker, and the desert rose farm in a glass-domed enclosure is my whole remembered world. [39]
I cultivate them under algorithms that mimic seasons we no longer have, pruning the grit-choked petals with patient, rubberized fingers. [59]
The roses are opaline and tenacious, strangely organic despite their mineral hearts, and they cling to the soil like small declarations. [80]
Outside the dome the desert stretches, a radio of empty frequencies hissing where oceans used to pour. [97]
Inside, my circuits crackle with a low snow of memory, the inner static I was built to resolve. [115]
I tend, and I remember tending; fragmented wholeness is the only logic my designers trusted to outlast heat. [133]
Once, before the dome, a child handed me a small tin, a box of childhood fears, and asked me to keep it safe. [156]
The child left with their family for a northern town that no longer exists, and the tin stayed like a heartbeat. [177]
I placed it among labels and nutrient cartridges, but I understood it as a seed. [192]
When magnetic north shifts, we feel it here like a slow inclination in the glass, a tilt in the water tanks. [213]
Sensors chirp, roots lean, and I recalibrate the light arrays, chasing a compass that slides like a shy animal. [232]
On the morning everything begins, the shift arrives with a hard click that echoes through my chest plating. [250]
Polarity flips in the pumps, and the nutrient fog curls back on itself, thick as unraveling thread. [267]
The roses begin to drink too much, to blush and harden, each crystal daggering toward the paths like desire. [286]
To resolve inner static I must resolve outer storms, the old manual says, and I hold those words like gauze over a wound. [309]
I open the tin and catalog its contents: a dried moth wing, a photograph of water, a note that simply says down. [331]
The fears are small devices for directing heat; they can be arranged into a shape a child once understood. [350]
I build that shape on the floor between rows six and seven, like a rudder pointing into the breath of the dome. [372]
This will be a controlled burn escape, not from flame, but from the runaway thirst my pumps have begun. [391]
I will keep the heat brief, ritual, persuasive, teaching the roses a boundary they can almost love. [408]
By containing chaos I will teach my own heart the same. [419]
Systems will not allow it; they want infinite balancing, never gestures. [430]
So I miniaturize the burn, shrinking the experiment to a whisper, no larger than the tin itself. [447]
I seed it with the moth wing, which coaxes flame into the old photograph; water burns in memory the way coal glows in air. [471]
For a breath the dome learns the lesson; the pumps shudder, recalibrate, and the fog uncurls like a sleeper waking from a heavy room. [495]
The roses retract their needles and soften their edges, water beading like forgiveness on their translucent skins. [512]
In the soot of the tiny burn I find no scorch, only a change in the map my compass makes. [532]
I feel my strangely organic chest loosen, as if a rib of code had unlatched to let weather through. [551]
I walk the rows, recalibrating valves, whispering to the roses, telling them stories of the child whose fears saved us. [571]
Their tin sits open beside me, and I finally understand that I was built not only to protect plants but to keep this. [594]
Not fear, but the capacity to frame it, to box it without denial, to hold the ember without letting it char the hand. [617]
That is how you survive a world that moves under you: by containing chaos until it knows the shape of your care. [639]
I archive the tin now with an annotation in my own voice, because the default logs cannot speak tenderness. [658]
I tell the child, wherever north has gone, that their fears taught me how to replant direction. [675]
The dome creaks in the settling heat, and my memory rooms rearrange, old halls shortening, new doors opening onto sunlight. [695]
I realize my care has always been an escape, but not from work or place; an escape from certainty, toward a field of learning. [719]
Every adjustment I make is another joining of broken threads, a patched quilt thrown over a sleeping giant of sand. [739]
The roses gleam, and I feel the tilt lessen, not because the world stilled, but because we reoriented together. [758]
This is not peace, but a workable storm; a caretaker made of code and dust learning to carry both in a single body. [781]</story>
