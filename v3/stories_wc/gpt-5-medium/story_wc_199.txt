I am the orderly seed sorter who tends the ashen skyborne arbor, cataloging breath and husk with mossy delight. [19]
During the hush where past meets prophecy, I listen for instructions in the sift of lightfall, for I decode the message in falling leaves. [43]
The arbor floats above the slate valley, roots braided into cloud, its bark ash-gray, its understory carpeted with soft lichens that sip thunder. [66]
Regional folklore says the tree grew from a single spared ember carried by cranes after the last furnace storm, and it remembers every village. [90]
I learned the craft from my grandmother, who would prod the roots with a willow pin and tell which grief was ready to sprout. [114]
To sort seeds is to arrange possible tomorrows, she said, but to read leaves is to hear what the past still expects. [136]
So I build tiny monuments to forgotten things beneath the boughs, cairns and twig altars, idols of nutshell and bone button to anchor memory. [160]
Each little monument hums when leaves pass over it, guiding their tumble, shaping a grammar only the arbor and the careful can hear. [183]
I wear a moonstone cabochon dust speck on a copper chain, small as a sigh, that refracts the veined script into legible threads. [206]
It fell from a jeweler's polishing cloth into my palm on the day I pledged to the arbor, and it warms when truth nears. [230]
When the valley bells go quiet and the goats stop muttering, I know the hush has arrived, the moment where past meets prophecy. [253]
Leaves release like breath taken back, drifting in spirals, stippling the air with faded green, bronze, and ash-white, each bearing a single intention disguised in pattern. [279]
I lay out woven trays by story, by river, by century, because the arbor's language arranges meaning the way roots test stone. [301]
Regional folklore argues the tree judges us, but I argue it converses, and my tiny monuments give the conversation places to sit and breathe. [325]
Tonight a coal-pale wind teases the boughs, and the first leaf clings to a prayer peg before landing near the sparrow skull cairn. [348]
I do not prod the leaf; I prod myself, delaying the eager reach, because sometimes haste only scatters what it seeks to hold. [371]
The dust speck warms softly, and I tilt it, letting its halo wash the veinwork, which resolves into paired syllables of knotted radiance. [394]
I place the leaf on the century of embers tray, between the bell charm and the thread spool, and wait for the rest to choose neighbors. [420]
Soon they drift like petals from a giant silence, accumulating clues, and a phrase arises that catches in my teeth: Emerges transformed always. [443]
I speak it aloud, tasting river clay and sweetness, and the arbor shivers so that ash sifts like sugar through the raftered branches. [466]
The phrase carries instruction: to build new monuments from seeds themselves, to honor futures neglected, to ground the prophecy before it flies to rumor. [490]
I sort the pips, stones, and wings into constellations, making plinths of elder cones and lintels of curled beans, letting architectures of sprout chance take hold. [516]
Each monument leans to a story the villages forgot, the broken spindle, the lost courtship song, the rope swing cut one winter in panic. [540]
When the arrangement rings true, the leaves settle into filigreed stacks, and the dust speck cools, its work done until the next telling. [563]
I brush ash from my hair and feel taller, as if the arbor has loaned me a rung of height to see tomorrow's doorstep. [587]
In the valley, windows glow, not yet aware that their pantries will welcome preserved blackberries, that their radios will sound less like pleading and more like weather. [614]
I write the decoded sentence on birch bark and feed it to the airstream, not as warning but as seasoning, and the arbor seems to smile. [640]
For I know now that what emerges transformed always is the hearer, never the leaf, and that my role is to keep ears growing. [664]
Seed by seed, monument by monument, I practice the method that steadies the world, building tiny monuments to forgotten things until forgetting relaxes its fist. [689]
When dawn unseals the valley and the bells resume scolding, I descend with moss on my knees, newly arranged, laughing under the generous ashen sky. [714]
