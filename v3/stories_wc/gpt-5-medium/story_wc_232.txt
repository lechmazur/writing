<story>I am a lonely antique map dealer who sells potential to people who prefer it to place. [17]
Lonely is not the right word, but it is the word I use. [30]
In my shop, elevation lines curl like sleeping cats behind glass. [41]
On the counter sits a type foundry matrix chip, the small kind that punches letters into molten lead. [59]
It belonged to Ruth, who taught me to hear the geography inside metal. [72]
Ruth left it and a lingering promise on the day the creek swallowed the footbridge. [87]
We had promised to find the doorway of decisions together when midsummer came. [100]
She called it a hinge in the world, where choosing could be seen. [113]
She was empirically intuitive, happiest when observation and hunch braided into something testable. [126]
Her instructions, careful as a river rock, were written on the back of a freight receipt. [142]
Follow ants home at midsummer, it read, and listen for a seam that will glimmer. [157]
The creek rises when it is time, she wrote, and you must move. [170]
Years passed, and I kept still, cataloging other people choosing in vellum and ink. [184]
As midsummer neared again, the footbridge was rebuilt, and I packed Ruth's chip. [197]
It was engraved with a broken letter that looked like a doorway cut from an alphabet. [213]
I left at dawn, walking upstream along the creek as the first heat gathered. [227]
Ants were everywhere, shining black commas on pale stones, each carrying the punctuation of crumbs. [242]
I crouched and watched the flow of them until a single path resolved. [255]
It angled away from the trail into a thicket of willow and barbed light. [269]
I followed ants home, repeating the phrase the way some people repeat prayers. [282]
Beneath the willows the ground dipped into an opening that smelled like rain without clouds. [297]
A blooming cavern breathed cold air, and inside it, flowers had rooted in a spill of sunlight. [314]
It was midsummer exactly, and the bloom was impossible and exact in its geometry. [328]
Petals glimmer where quartz veins surfaced, a skiff of light riding mineral thresholds. [341]
Outside, as the creek rises from last night's mountain storm, it muttered against the stones. [356]
I felt the promise pull tight like a knot behind my ribs. [368]
Ruth used to say promises linger because they are built from small, repeated choices. [382]
They are the tracks ants leave, she said, a bridge you can cross by watching. [397]
At the cavern's far wall a seam of stone looked exactly like the letter on the chip. [414]
I pressed the matrix into a notch, and it seated with a restrained click. [428]
Water hissed outside, the creek climbing the banks so persistently that the air tasted electric. [443]
I could leave, I thought, and return to the maps that ask nothing back. [457]
Instead I looked for evidence the way Ruth had taught me to have faith in fact. [473]
The seam exhaled a draft that smelled like pinyon and typesmoke, familiar and improbable. [487]
I put my ear to stone and heard something like pages turning under slow water. [502]
Then the wall withdrew a fraction, and light poured through as if corrected by a proofreader. [518]
There is no drama in this, I told myself, only a choice that maps cannot depict. [534]
The doorway of decisions was a hallway of mirrors tiled with topographies I had ignored. [549]
Each pane showed me walking different routes, buying tickets, sharing breakfasts, rebuilding the bridge, or refusing. [565]
I understood then that the door did not choose for you, it only stopped time long enough to notice. [584]
Outside, the creek rose against the gravel like words assembling into an urgent sentence. [598]
The ants returned along the sill, each balancing a pale petal like a sail. [612]
I felt their empirically intuitive wisdom in my knees and fingers, observe and act. [626]
I took the chip back from the seam, because leaving it would make the door too easy. [643]
I put it in my pocket, turned once, and stepped where the reflections overlapped. [657]
For a moment the world answered with a clean, thin glimmer like a percussion note. [672]
When the light settled, the hallway was gone, but my legs already held a remembered angle. [688]
I walked out into midsummer and crossed the creek where the ants had arched a bridge of moving bodies. [707]
The water pressed my shins and dragged grit from my shoes, but it did not take me. [724]
On the far bank I looked back, expecting grief, and found instead a usability I could trust. [741]
The promise had not ended; it had finished transforming into something I would keep daily. [756]
I would return to the shop and travel by choosing, one decision at a time. [771]
In my pocket the matrix chip warmed, a small weight that aligned my steps like a compass. [788]</story>
