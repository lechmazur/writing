<story>I am the odd-hour librarian at the scientific poetry library. [10]
My shift blooms while patrons browse, their shoes whispering proofs across the tiled floor. [24]
observed solitude is my element, the hush between stanzas and experiments. [35]
I tie a tattered silk scarf once around my neck, twice for luck. [48]
It smells faintly of ozone and printer's ink, a logic of breath. [60]
People call me sanely eccentric, which is the only way to shelve infinities. [73]
Every book here has margins annotated with equations that rhyme. [83]
Every poem here graphs a life that refuses to straighten. [93]
I am not guarding volumes; I am tending analog memories. [103]
They hum like filament bulbs, warming the corners no circuit plans for. [115]
Tonight, a boy traces the Mandelbrot on a napkin, his finger looping forever. [128]
An older woman reads Hawking as if it were psalms, pausing on light. [141]
Between them, shelves curve like coastlines I have not finished mapping. [152]
I shelve by negative curvature, a private practice I hardly confess. [163]
It began years ago, when my mentor showed me a paper of odd folds. [177]
He said the stacks themselves could be navigated through hyperbolic geometry. [188]
If the path curved enough, you would arrive somewhere before you left. [200]
I laughed then, the harmless laughter of a novice who trusts shelves. [212]
Now I know the truth he meant, the compass you can only borrow. [225]
When the air sharpens, I step between History of Number and Breath Mechanics. [238]
There is a little saddle of space there, where angles add to less. [251]
I rub the scarf, feel its frayed edge like a coastline of silk. [264]
The fabric belonged to my mother, who believed libraries kept the weather honest. [277]
When she died, pages felt colder, and I sought a warmer mathematics. [289]
What I want is simple, to find the place where stories live. [301]
Not the archive, not the index, but their breathing country of origin. [313]
Shelving by curvature is my footpath, my unmap and my staff. [324]
While patrons browse, I follow the bent aisle that refuses the straightest line. [337]
The boy looks up, and I nod, as if to a fellow traveler. [350]
The woman smiles, holding gravity like a candle cupped against drafts. [361]
Where the aisle dips, the letters on spines tilt into new alignments. [373]
I see punctuation as compass roses, and dedications as small lighthouses. [384]
My mentor said it would take a shock to reawaken the path. [396]
I have chosen quieter methods, because shocks never know when to stop. [408]
So I recite theorems like lullabies, each clause opening a new door. [420]
Triangle sums less than straight, circle grows boundless, chord sings longer than arc. [433]
The shelves answer with a long breath, and the air gets saltier. [445]
A map unrolls itself down the corridor, but it is not paper. [457]
It is the distribution of endings, the shorelines where closures erode. [468]
I step off the grid and into a reading room with no walls. [481]
Chairs sit like commas in a sentence still deciding what to mean. [493]
A window looks out on unbuilt mornings, where the light has footnotes. [505]
I place the scarf on a hook and listen for the smallest truth. [518]
It comes as two patrons clearing their throats, on either side of night. [531]
They are still browsing, unknowing that the room has shifted around them. [543]
I must return with news, or else the map will fold shut forever. [556]
I walk to a desk made from cross-sections of meteorites and oak. [568]
There, a blank card waits, asking what the library will remember. [579]
I write that stories live where vectors consent to curve around a heart. [592]
I add that memory has weight, and the spine learns to carry it. [605]
I sign my name like a route, not a rule, and the door sighs open. [620]
Behind it rise shelves growing from seabeds, heavy with wet paper and salt. [633]
Voices murmur like tide charts, and I understand the grammar at last. [645]
Every ending is a coastline, and every plot a weather-making current. [656]
I lift the scarf and wring it once, and the salt becomes snow. [669]
Snow falls into letters that land softly on the patrons' shoulders. [680]
They look up, unsuspecting poets, and continue choosing what to carry home. [692]
I return the path the way a river returns, by leaving evidence of curves. [706]
At the saddle of space, I file my card under Promise, Noted. [718]
The room resumes its previous angles, but my pockets keep their tide. [730]
The boy folds his napkin, now mapped with a coastline he cannot name. [743]
The woman writes a question in the margin, and the page answers kindly. [756]
Closing time arrives without alarm, like a theorem that needs no proof. [768]
I lock the door, counting heartbeats, and the library counts back in waves. [781]
Tonight I have not found the place where stories live, but I have seen its weather. [797]</story>
