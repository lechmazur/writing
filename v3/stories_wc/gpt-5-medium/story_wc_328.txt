<story>They hired me as a night janitor, but I was a cryptid researcher working undercover. [15]
The herbalist's underground garden breathed like a sleeping whale under the city, damp and secretive. [30]
I came after hours, broom in hand, catalog in mind, listening for footfalls that never fit human cadence. [48]
It was after the missing return changed that the garden doors began to jam behind me. [64]
People vanished and then unvanished, altered in posture, like the soil had edited their spines while they were gone. [83]
I logged each anomaly in a pocket notebook, pretending to tally mops and bottles. [97]
Real notes rode in my bones, in the ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose. [114]
The herbalist herself never blinked at my questions, only smiled with a patience that tasted like iron. [131]
Her shelves were stacked with jars of vines, soil, and a single flint arrowhead wrapped in gauze. [148]
She said it had pruned a comet, and I laughed because I needed that laugh. [163]
Laughter kept my cover warm in the cold rooms. [172]
The garden walls hung with bulbs that swung in a gravitationally playful rhythm, tugged by drafts I could not trace. [192]
Roots climbed the masonry like fingers learning Braille, whispering of old weather and older mouths. [207]
I waited for the thing no one would name, because naming is hospitality and this house was cautious. [225]
My only informant was a borrowed cordless phone that crackled in the supply closet behind the potting table. [243]
Every midnight it rang without number, and I answered like I answered ghosts. [256]
Leads came via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone, a voice tasting of copper and wind. [274]
It told me about a harmony untamed hiding under the mint beds, a chord too wide for our lungs. [293]
It said the arrowhead was once a tooth, and the tooth remembered falling. [306]
I pressed the arrowhead to my ear and heard gravel weep backward into mountains. [320]
That was when the seedlings began to move like compass needles drunk on auroras. [334]
They leaned toward the drain where the floor breathed, inhaling, exhaling, reshaping hours into something with ankles. [351]
I spoke aloud the mission I kept quiet, which was to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke. [368]
Not a cruel joke, but one that makes the night snort and bump its shin on a star. [386]
Bitterness had been archived here, where returning people could not rethread their names without tearing. [401]
The voice said the garden fed on that ache until the ache learned to feed back. [417]
So I cleaned as ordered, and I listened, and I arranged buckets into constellations no one else noticed. [435]
When the herbalist slept, I slipped the arrowhead into the soil above the drain. [449]
I told the tooth it could become a seed again, if it wanted, and I promised to witness. [467]
The bulbs slowed their swing, then found a new arc, as if taught by a tongue older than doors. [486]
The floor inhaled, and something below exhaled me, a draft lifting the hairs on my wrists. [502]
I dialed the phone without ringing, and the voice answered with frostbitten hope, like a thaw rehearsing. [519]
It told me to sing the hiss between stations, not the song, and to keep my eyes shut. [537]
I sang until my throat tasted like tin, and the seedlings stood up like citizens. [552]
Under the mint, the drain opened wider, revealing a staircase of vertebrae descending into black peppermint. [568]
The herbalist woke and watched me, her eyes wet with worry and a private amusement. [583]
She whispered that the garden needed a keeper, not a hero, and that keepers sometimes must be kept. [601]
I told her I was already kept by the work, and that undercover simply meant under earth. [618]
We descended, the bulbs following, gravitationally playful attendants in an aisle made of breath. [632]
At the landing, a windless choir throbbed, not music but pressure, the body of a harmony untamed. [649]
It felt like being wept for by a planet that never knew our names yet missed us anyway. [667]
The arrowhead cracked, soft as ice, and sprouted a root that contained handwriting. [680]
The letters spelled my alias, then my real name, then the names of those who had returned different. [698]
They did not accuse; they asked for a keeper who would laugh with them while being remade. [715]
I said yes, and the stair inhaled again, and we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness. [731]
The joke grew, not cruel, but cosmic enough to lighten soil, and heavy enough to hold us. [748]
When we climbed back up, morning had been taught to return without changing what it loved. [764]
I stayed on as janitor, keeper, listener, and the garden kept me with a frostbitten hope that never thaws. [783]</story>
