<story>I am a cultured museum guide sent on loan to the drowned provinces. [13]
My employers say I am historically oriented, which is true and sometimes a curse. [27]
I came to the grotto city behind a monumental waterfall to catalogue surviving crafts. [41]
It was after the beekeeper's last visit, when honey ran bitter and maps went blank. [56]
The displaced persons had tunneled chambers like prayer beads, each echoing with interrupted lineage. [70]
They called me Curator as if it were armor, though I wished for gentler titles. [85]
Moist air carried a scent of beeswax, damp limestone, and something like rosewater dread. [99]
Children guided me by candle, while elders guarded small fires fed with driftwood and rumor. [114]
Their leader, Senka, greeted me holding an emerald-tinted opera glass lens like a relic. [128]
Through it, she said, the river wrote in green ink upon the walls of history. [143]
She pressed the lens to my eye, and carvings hidden in limestone thaw into testimony. [158]
I saw braiders knotting stories, potters quilting glazes, beekeepers teaching hives to hum warnings. [172]
All that had been disrupted when the surface wars cracked the aquifers and drove everyone downward. [188]
Senka told me the beekeeper left a promise and a death a season ago. [202]
He mapped forage routes, then vanished beneath thunderwater, leaving hives hung with black crepe. [216]
Now their wax cooled too hard and would not take impressions of seals or faces. [231]
My task was to rescue dying arts, though I feared becoming embalmer rather than nurse. [246]
I began with names, because history begins there, and names were washing away nightly. [260]
Senka asked what method I loved that could live in floodlight and hunger. [273]
I told her of a family custom of baking bread shaped like initials, fragrant testimonies. [288]
We baked for births, funerals, reconciliations, so the letters rose and were eaten tenderly. [302]
Bread could hold crumbs of ash, pollen, and grief while still feeding a room. [316]
She approved, and we built ovens from broken cisterns, flues drawing through snail-shell vents. [330]
Children kneaded, elders measured by hand, and I recorded each initial with careful context. [344]
We stacked loaves shaped like A for Arkady, L for Lela, B for Beekeeper. [358]
When eaten, the crumbs were sprinkled into wax molds to soften it, and thaw. [372]
Under the green lens, the softened wax took faces again, and people wept quietly. [386]
I wrote histories while feeding them, and they fed me stories like salted nectar. [400]
A murmur that the beekeeper had been murdered circled, refusing to settle in syllables. [414]
We baked a question mark, curled like a larva, and placed it on his threshold. [429]
That night the waterfall changed key, lower and older, and everyone slept in armor. [443]
I dreamed of opera, of balconies crowded with displaced persons staring through the emerald-tinted lens. [458]
They sang, Keep our names warm, and the stage curtains bled honey in ribbons. [472]
I woke afraid, ridiculous, hopeful, salt-tongued, feeling history tug like a hive-slick rope. [485]
Senka brought news: the lens was not for seeing but for selecting what survived. [499]
Only artifacts viewed through it would endure the cave's damp and the river's impatience. [513]
We tested; a pot unfavored by the lens slumped, while a spoon's story hardened. [527]
Responsibility settled on me like nectar armor, sweet and unbearable, and I accepted. [540]
We chose a day to carry the names into open spray, to test endurance. [554]
Elders lined like stalagmites, children with baskets of letters steaming, and I bore the lens. [569]
The waterfall threw cold lace on our faces, and our courage felt edible and breakable. [584]
I lifted the emerald-tinted opera glass lens, and the initials glowed like pond-lit constellations. [598]
Each letter drifted into mist, returned as a whisper, then settled heavier than bread. [612]
People chewed their own initials and swore to remember another person before swallowing. [625]
This vow stitched corridors; even damp air seemed to hold with invisible, historical seams. [639]
Then a stranger arrived, wet to the knees, carrying a hive box that rattled. [653]
He spoke plainly: the beekeeper drowned saving queens, not murdered, and asked forgiveness. [666]
Grief thawed into apologies, whose steam rose to lace the cataract with kinder ghosts. [680]
We baked a crown of B's, and the stranger placed it on the foam. [694]
It floated, lingered, melted, and the hive box quieted like a prayer concluding. [707]
Senka gave me the lens, saying history needs caretakers who can feed it. [720]
I felt unworthy, but worthy workers are rare, and need is a stern docent. [734]
I promised to return seasonally, to carry their methods outward like bees carry rumor. [748]
When I left, the waterfall seemed to bow, and the grotto hearts kept beating. [762]
I am still a museum guide, but now my galleries breathe honeyed mist and memory. [777]
I am still historically oriented, yet my history rises warm, eaten, and therefore enduring. [791]</story>
