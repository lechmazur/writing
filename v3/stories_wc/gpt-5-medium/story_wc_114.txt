<story>After fever breaks, I hike to the mountain weather station, a rib of galvanized rooms stitched to stone, humming with auroral sorrow. [22]
I come to weigh what I cannot speak, to find the weight of a swallowed truth before it calcifies behind my sternum. [44]
The caretaker calls down a corridor, and the echo answers like low surf under ice. [59]
He tells me the oracle is between transmissions and prefers quiet when the wind tilts. [74]
When I meet her, she is repairing a barometer with mittened fingers, pale eyes peripherally aware of everything except my apology for arriving unannounced. [98]
She says she is a fault-tolerant oracle, which means she refuses to break when the world submits imperfect data. [117]
Which is all the world ever does. [124]
She makes tea the color of rain charts and lays out a botanical illustration of a mountain gentian, its blue trumpets printed with veins like frost lines. [151]
You brought me this, she says, though I have not moved, and there is ash I smudge on the gentian petals. [172]
I reach toward it without meaning to confess, and my sleeve leaves a second gray comet trailing through the printed blue. [193]
The oracle nods as if weather has performed an expected trick, and she says our certainties are swaying, like towers with tired knees. [216]
I tell her I swallowed a lie to keep someone I loved from drowning in it, and now it lives inside me like a small stone star. [243]
Every step rattles it, and I want to find the weight of that swallowed truth, as if mass could absolve meaning. [264]
She smiles without light and asks where I learned to carry a burden by occupying margins. [280]
In school, I say, and in houses where voices were weather, and in hospitals where silence kept time with machines. [300]
The oracle takes the botanical illustration outside to the lee of the anemometer, and the paper quivers with the same frailty as my chest. [324]
She draws a line with soot along the stem, a careful smudge to mark the fulcrum between root and bloom. [344]
Hold the page, she says, and hold your breath, and let your hands believe this gentian weighs as much as your secret. [366]
I do, and the air moves through us, and I feel the faint tug where the soot line crosses, a hinge of swaying certainties. [390]
The oracle says the storm will arrive by evening, that grief has isobars, and that our instruments are most honest when barely within range. [414]
I tell her the lie was about a diagnosis, mine, because the person I loved was dissolving already, and I feared the word would finish the work. [441]
She died anyway, I add, and the truth survived like a seed in the dark of my throat, refusing either to sprout or to pass. [466]
The oracle listens to the antenna wires speaking in their thin metal tongues, and then she asks me to stand on the edge of the platform. [492]
Here we test your balance, she says, because a swallowed truth changes how you lean, and because the weather prefers witnesses who can be trusted. [517]
She shows me how to widen my stance until every force finds a path through, how to be fault tolerant without letting fault become home. [542]
We return inside as snow begins, and she places the gentian beneath a glass that magnifies the smudge until it becomes a continent split by a capillary sea. [570]
Your body did this, she says, and your body can unwrite it, not by scratching the page, but by learning where the balance turns. [594]
She unhooks a battered scale used for ice cores and sets it on the table between us like a judge who has stepped down into the aisle. [621]
Tell me the truth aloud, she says, by occupying margins you have left empty, not the center, because the center is where fear drums with cruel wrists. [648]
So I begin at the edge, talking about the color of her hair, the pattern of the blanket, the way she slept as weather mapped itself upon her brow. [677]
I circle inward until the lie stands there, simple as a stone, and I name it while the scale ticks its little metronome of snow. [702]
The oracle does not weigh my voice, only watches where the tension leaves my shoulders, peripherally aware that release occurs like dawn along a long, cold ridge. [729]
The storm arrives on schedule, like a mercy that hurts, and we stand at the window while the station shivers, faithful, battered, listening. [752]
After fever breaks, I had thought the world would steady, but some certainties must sway forever, and some truths become lighter only when they can be shared. [779]
The oracle folds the gentian and returns it; its smudge a map I read, a compass of auroral sorrow. [798]</story>
