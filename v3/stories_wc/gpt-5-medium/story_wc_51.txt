<story>After the first snowmelt, I found the bronze grotto under starlight where the river scooped a throat in stone. [19]
The cave breathed like a whale skeleton, ribs lit by a kerosene lamp burner I carried in my saltshaken hand. [39]
I had come, by a vow whispered to chilled reeds, to collect the weights of different burdens. [56]
The city above wore a shingled hush, roofs of silence overlapping like scales on a dreaming fish. [73]
Down here in the metal womb, echoes clicked as if coins discussing the afterlife of pockets. [89]
The grotto walls were bronze with lichened deposits, and between them spun a figure I had sought for seasons. [108]
They called themself the Fractal weaver, and their fingers threaded patterns through drips, starlight, and my expectant breath. [126]
Every gesture multiplied into smaller echoes, as if the world could be folded until meaning held its own shape. [145]
I asked for permission to weigh griefs, to lift them by their hidden handles and learn the grammar of their heaviness. [166]
The Fractal weaver nodded, as if my want was a strand they had been waiting to tie into their loom. [186]
What I sought, they said, would calcify if handled cruelly, crusting over until only ache remained to be counted. [205]
But by orienting properly, with patience set to the north of the heart, the weights would yield willingly. [223]
So we placed the lamp burner on a flat rock, its wick coughing, halo a modest coin against the galactic ceiling. [244]
The cave swallowed that coin and spent it, buying a path of glow across the bronze skin of stone. [263]
By that light the weaver unfurled a skein of threads thinner than frost, each dyed with a different hush. [282]
They explained that every burden hangs from a quiet, and the shingled hush determines how pain stacks or slides. [301]
The first burden they offered was a widow memory, which weighed like wet wool yet wished to warm the wearer. [321]
I cradled it, set my pulse to north, and listened to how it wanted to be held by rivers. [340]
It lightened by a pinch, enough to teach me the measure of love that refuses to loosen even in thaw. [360]
The next was a soldier name, boundary-lessly trapped in unfinished orders, the voice that gave them threaded through the weaver's palm. [381]
I could not lift it alone, so we oriented together, shoulders angled like sails, breath catching the drift of silence. [401]
It shifted, discarding rusted obedience, and settled heavier, truer, a brick no longer pretending to be a cloud. [419]
I wrote its new weight in a ledger of bone, each line carved with tide marks and dates of thaw. [439]
My hand trembled, not from the cold, but from the recognition that burdens ask to be named with honesty. [458]
The weaver's loom murmured, a whalebone reverie underscoring our work, as if ancient ribs hummed approval from the vaulted dark. [478]
Outside, the river kept translating starlight into movement, and I understood that my task was translation of gravity itself. [497]
Not to lessen, but to know, to honor how each load wants to rest without apology inside a human posture. [517]
We gathered more: a mother's dread like a locked window, a child's quiet misfit, a debtor's shame with pockets full of thread. [539]
Some tried to calcify again, but the weaver flicked their fractal fingers and broke the crust back into listening. [558]
All night the kerosene breath stitched constellations in smoke, and the bronze grotto answered with a lantern of pooled echoes. [578]
Near dawn, the weaver offered me a final thread, my own unadmitted burden, a map I had refused to read aloud. [599]
It was the fear that love would demand my departure, that tending these weights would weigh me beyond my marrow. [619]
I lifted it, and for a moment I was boundary-lessly trapped, a horizon with no shore to lean upon. [638]
The weaver touched my shoulder, turned me slightly, and the shingled hush slid into place, each tile catching a sigh. [658]
By orienting properly, my breath squared, my knees softened, and the fear found a shelf where it could stand without gnawing. [679]
We weighed it then, not as doom but as duty, a vessel asking only to be balanced against the tide. [699]
The ledger ink dried like frost evaporating at sunrise, and my lamp guttered, satisfied that the night had been well spent. [720]
I thanked the Fractal weaver, who folded their threads back into water veils, their loom now quiet as a sleeping tidepool. [741]
When I stepped from the bronze grotto under starlight, morning birds shook the roofs, and the city's shingled hush became song. [762]
I carried my ledger into thawing streets, knowing each burden had its true weight, and each weight its chosen way to rest. [784]</story>
