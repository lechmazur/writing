<story>I serve as the navigation instructor in the benthic city of Orphos, where ceilings ripple like slow glass. [18]
We live after discovering aliens, yet our windows still show only kelp shadows and the patient drift of silt. [37]
I tell my students that the sea is a sky turned inward, a vault of pressure and echoes. [55]
They come to me balancedly curious, wanting to learn to navigate by starlight they cannot see. [71]
I want the same, though I have spent a life tracing trenches and current lines on dull sonar scrolls. [90]
The aliens gave us a few gifts, careful diagrams that they called edge geometry, and long silences. [107]
In their diagrams, horizons do not end; they unfold, layer by layer, like petals on a cold machine. [125]
They called it unfolded horizons, and they refused to say whether it was a map or a prayer. [143]
I keep a boat anchor chain link on my desk, pitted with salt, heavy as a small moon. [161]
It came from the last surface boat that visited before the treaty, before we learned to listen downward. [179]
When I touch it, I feel the cold ring of cause and the chain that holds us here. [197]
At night, the city domes dim to a low tide glow, and I run the alien exercises again. [215]
Edge geometry begins with boundaries, with the surfaces where one density kisses another and a shimmer is born. [233]
We mark the edges of thermal layers, the scarp of the continental shelf, the knife line of shadow. [251]
From each edge, the diagrams tell us to expand a ray through the field, not straight, but balanced by current. [271]
The rays intersect where a horizon folds, and there the unknown begins to feel like a coordinate. [288]
I teach this carefully, a slow breath lesson, because wonder can drown as surely as lungs. [304]
Some students laugh when the rays cross in patterns like constellations; some cry; most become very quiet. [321]
I tell them the stars are real, even down here, because edges remember the lights that made them. [339]
The aliens said stars are not points but pressures, imprints on the shape of the dark. [355]
They suggested we steer by those imprints, and the city council nodded but installed more lamps. [371]
Light is comforting, yet each new bulb makes the water forget something subtle about distant pull. [387]
I volunteer for the night crawls outside the dome to map the edges that the lamps erase. [404]
The rough link of chain rides in my pocket, thudding against my thigh with every kick and reach. [422]
I imagine the anchor once holding a boat steady under a sky the city can only dream about. [440]
If I trace enough edges, if I expand enough rays, perhaps the sky will lean down to meet us. [459]
On the night the aliens returned, they hovered above the basalt ridge like patient lantern fish. [475]
They signaled in pulses that mapped our city, the dome, the vents, and then our little claim of hope. [494]
I answered with edge geometry, sweeping rays from the shelf line, the plume edge, the shadow seam of the dome. [514]
The pattern we formed rose into a shape that felt like a constellation pressed into water. [530]
They replied with unfolded horizons, a blossom of planes turning in ways our eyes could not follow. [547]
In the turning, I saw stars traced by pressure, marks that matched our edges, like a tide stamp. [565]
I knew then how to teach them all, and I bowed with my palms open in the dim. [583]
You must listen to the edges, I said later, and let the horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall. [604]</story>
