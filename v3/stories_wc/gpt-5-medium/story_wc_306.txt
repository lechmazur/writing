<story>I sell the weight of hesitation, a conscience for hire who charges by the breath it saves. [17]
Last night we argued in circles on the dunes, and after the campfire's last spark dies, we climb toward the breezy lighthouse at dawn. [41]
Lark hired me because she fears certainty more than scandal, and she needs someone to guard her while she spills truth like sand through fingers. [66]
She is sincerely insincere, practiced at admitting the mask so the face underneath can breathe. [81]
That contradiction is my favorite raw material, because I was hired for one reason only, to welcome nuance into certainty. [101]
The lighthouse keeper was her father, and he taught decisions as if they were weather, chosen by deciphering wind chime selections hung along the railing. [126]
I do not scoff at odd methods, because doubt has its own instruments and refuses trumpets. [142]
When we reach the gallery, the morning wind leans into us and fills the shawl she wears, which she calls the cloak of doubt. [166]
It is stitched from old campaign banners and midnight raincoats, a ceremonial garment for someone who refuses to trust a single drumbeat. [188]
The chimes wake as if remembering her, each pipe a different metal scavenged from wrecks and trophies, so decisions here already carry the sound of aftermath. [214]
Before we begin, she unrolls a cloth bundle and offers me a hollow mirror shard, the strangest retainer I have ever accepted. [236]
It reflects a ring of nothing, as if the world were an eyelid and this glass were its pupil missing on purpose. [258]
My job, she whispers under the wind, is to help her decide whether to confess the port bribes that saved the lifeboat program or hide them for the election. [287]
The city needs those boats, she says, but it also needs to know I am not governed by money or pretense. [308]
We fasten the striker to the center and I unhook the brake, letting the full draft move through the instrument like a choir learning to breathe. [334]
She asks me what a conscience costs when oceans are involved, and I tell her the price varies with the tide and the size of her honesty. [361]
We listen as the chimes argue, an etude of collisions, and I translate the intervals with a notebook of the keeper's code I learned overnight. [386]
Her father believed the sea arranged choices, not to absolve anyone, but to place risks in the open where courage could be measured. [409]
The first pattern spells give it all back, the second spells keep quiet, and the third, unexpected, spells speak and set terms. [431]
I ask Lark what she wants her people to become, and she answers like someone carrying protected vulnerability, strong inside a shell that others mistake for armor. [458]
She wants them to accept both the rescue and the rot, and to demand a better bargain from her than a flawless fiction. [481]
We choose the third message, not because it is easiest, but because it does not let her hide under victory or huddle beneath shame. [505]
She will return the money, name every official who tempted her, and argue that the boats be funded through taxes she once promised to cut. [530]
My fee is the shard, whose emptiness teaches her where to stop performing, because a hollow mirror shard can only show what you bring to its edge. [557]
She tucks it into her pocket, and the cloak of doubt settles around her shoulders like a weather report that warns without panicking. [580]
When she steps to the rail, the town below starts to wake, and the gulls keep time as if they were impartial jurors. [603]
I stand behind her with my rented doubt and rented faith, a conscience for hire who will always choose wind over thunder when steering a voice. [629]</story>
