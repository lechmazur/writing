<story>The pause in our difficult conversation flowered inside the ancient grotto under stars. [13]
I held my breath, pretending to study barnacles while your words hovered beyond saying. [27]
I am a tidal-pool chronicler, and pauses are my native habitat. [38]
You knew that, which is why you trusted the hush to hold meaning. [51]
Our lantern cast sea glass light across slick stone, and the sky pressed close. [65]
Between us, on my palm, sat the jade cicada my mentor left me. [78]
It was cool, heavy, and carved with lines like coastline topography. [89]
You were asking whether I would go inland, away from the tide. [101]
Not because you wanted distance, but because archives demanded it, and love complicated logistics. [115]
The grotto dripped like a slow metronome counting mercy, and still I waited. [128]
I listened the way I catalog reefs, warmly observant, collecting fringe details that nobody prizes. [143]
This is my method, through tangential approach, circling truth until it offers passage. [156]
I tilted the jade cicada, letting starlight crawl its wings, remembering its metaphor. [169]
Larval stillness, sudden split, transition periods so precise the shell remembers the seam. [182]
My life has always traced those seams, the in between hours after storms pass. [196]
Tide ebbing, tide turning, you and I poised on the ledge between versions. [209]
Across this pause I could foresee more than either of us dared utter. [222]
Not prophecy, exactly, but the near futures that texture themselves into touchable threads. [235]
A year inland, mornings crowded by train schedules instead of tides, our arguments compacted. [249]
Another year, the coastline bruised by storms, my notes smearing, the grotto silting shut. [263]
And another, in which we stayed, and I mistook comfort for completion and drifted. [277]
Each view arrived not head on, but sideways, gull feather soft, bearing saline plausibility. [291]
I own no grand sight, only this sidelong seeing, this patience with threshold weather. [305]
You watched me weighing the cicada and the tide, and perhaps felt abandoned. [318]
I wanted you to know I was not delaying, I was listening to time. [332]
Its texture changes with attention, like foam tightened by wind, then collapsing into lace. [346]
You had asked me for an answer, and paused to let me breathe bravery. [360]
I took the pause as a tidepool, shallow, reflective, holding starfall like minnows. [373]
In that bowl, I saw our laugh fester if we chose resentment over risk. [387]
I also saw our fear thaw if change arrived honored, named a shared migration. [401]
My journals call such crossings transition periods, the moments when identities trade languages. [414]
Those are my specimens, more living than any hermit crab I ever teased loose. [428]
I brought the jade cicada to this grotto because it remembers how to split. [442]
It asks nothing except that we choose the seam, and press ourselves gently. [455]
The sea has always been my teacher, but tonight you are my textbook. [468]
I turned toward you, warmly observant even of your silence, and finally answered. [481]
Yes, I will go inland, not to abandon the coast, but to extend it. [495]
I will carry the grotto in my pockets and read puddles in city drains. [509]
I will trace tides through commuter breaths, and lay seaweed between library pages. [522]
I will document how you and I become we again, by learning new littorals. [536]
You smiled, not victory, not surrender, more like a shoreline adjusting to moonlight. [549]
Your eyes found the cicada, and I felt them trust its stubborn glint. [562]
We had been stuck naming outcomes, when what we needed was naming passage. [575]
To discover the texture of time, we must touch it while we change. [588]
The grotto approved with a soft breath, as if grateful for gentler tides. [601]
I thought of my mentor, whose cicada guided them through their own molting years. [615]
They had taught me to notice pivots concealed in daily frictions and kindnesses. [628]
They called them star fed hinges, small, exact places where futures could rotate smoothly. [642]
Tonight, our pause had discovered its hinge, and we both dared to press. [655]
I kissed the cicada for luck and tucked it between notebook and heart. [668]
The sea, having eavesdropped, loosened a mild ripple that found our ankles. [680]
Above, stars collected like grains of salt, and the grotto kept our resolution. [693]
Across that single pause, an arch had formed, patient, exact, and finally passable. [706]</story>
