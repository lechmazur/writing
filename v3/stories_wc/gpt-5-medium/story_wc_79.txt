<story>We live after the gate rusts shut, and the city exhales a sound like sand poured over bone. [18]
Every street sways, because this is a city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles. [33]
I am a spiral-shell cartographer, quietly driven to follow the ridged spirals beneath our sandals. [48]
My reed whistle hangs at my throat, its pitch charting winds that skim the algae roofs. [64]
All day the light is a sunwashed dread that makes every bright edge feel like a warning. [81]
Beyond the turtle-raft horizon, the silent watchers stand like nailheads hammered into the sky. [95]
My mother led a lost expedition to question the silent watchers on the horizon, and never returned. [112]
I trace what trails remain, because questions rot if kept, and I want them answered, or to know why answers crack. [133]
I learned to travel through pattern languages, reading barnacle constellations, salt scars, and the pulse of shell. [150]
My maps curl inwards like the turtles themselves, each arc a thread pulled from the seafloor of memory. [168]
Since then, with the harbor gate rusted shut, no barge can dock, and hunger begins to speak in numbers. [187]
People gather on the dome-square and point at the watchers as if pointing could draw mercy from their silhouettes. [206]
I cannot watch them watching us and do nothing. [215]
At dawn I unroll my shell maps, oil my sandals, and test the reed whistle's three notes for wind truth. [235]
The turtles drift in caravans, their shells mortared with our houses, alleys braided between corals like tethered rivers. [253]
I set off across roofs and ridges, following a seam of bleached limpets toward the long bright nails of the watchers. [274]
My mother taught me to listen for what the shell refuses to say, and for what the wind repeats. [293]
On the third span, I hear a crack under my heel like a knuckle confessing, and I freeze. [311]
The crack blossoms into a hollow, and I find a copper tag etched with a spiral my mother favored. [330]
Across its face runs the wordless script of tide knots, a phrase in our family tongue for turn back only if called. [352]
No voice calls me, only the high note of the day, which is not mercy but obligation. [369]
I slip the tag on my cord and move onward, charting the pattern of shade through the alleys as the sun tilts. [391]
When crosswinds rise, I lift the reed whistle and blow the first note, which tells me the distance of risk. [411]
Patterns lie that way too; the watchers flicker in heat, but their intervals remain, five widths between, then six, then five. [432]
Five, then six, then five is the rhythm of warning used on stormposts, a metered refusal that means ask carefully. [452]
Behind me the city hums, clothes snapping on lines, pots clacking, a thousand small assurances trying to sound louder than hunger. [473]
Closer, the watchers reveal seams like jointed armor, not statues but something that learned stillness the way turtles learn tides. [493]
I find their lashings in a gulley of shell, ropes gnawed by salt, and a ledger weighed with a stone for loyalty. [515]
The ledger is my mother's hand, the lines curling like currents, noting exchanges of questions and silence, dates ending in emptiness. [536]
At the back she drew a lattice of dots and swirls, a pattern language I know as the grammar of crossing. [557]
I read it aloud to the wind, and the watchers turn, all at once, like sunflowers that prefer the shadow. [577]
Their sudden attention falls over me like light through deep water, beautiful and heavy, bright with a pressure that bruises. [597]
I lift the reed whistle again and play the second note, the one that means I come with maps and salt. [618]
My question is simple and has eaten me for years: What do you see when you look at us? [637]
The watchers answer by altering their spacing, drawing a corridor of glare that outlines the absence where the expedition should stand. [658]
In the white between them, I see footprints that stop, and then the shimmer where a person might be thinned into silence. [680]
I understand then that they watch as measures, not as mercies, and that my mother's last map became a unit of distance. [702]
I could turn back and warn the city to bend its houses inward, to learn to move by increments and echoes. [723]
But I am quietly driven, and the path her lattice drew is not for retreat. [738]
I step into the corridor of glare, blow the third note that means I am ready to be measured, and walk. [759]
Behind me the turtles keep their vast time, the city keeps its thin breath, and the light keeps ringing like a bell. [781]</story>
