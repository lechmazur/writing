<story>It begins after the shadow detaches, when a crafty lantern maker climbs the windward path to the floating island tea garden. [21]
He carries a satchel of glass blanks and uncut stones that chime like small bells at each step. [39]
The garden surrounds a glass basilica on a floating isle, an airy cathedral that catches sky like a spoon catches sugar. [60]
Under its shimmering ribs, the tea is poured with ceremony, and the wounded come to trade sleep for brightness. [79]
He came with one motive, luminous torment wrapped in patient hands, to fold grief into origami cranes until the ache learns shape. [101]
Without a shadow, he is thin as a thread of smoke, yet he has learned how to thicken light. [120]
His craft begins with gem polishing, each facet coaxed from stone like a confession coaxed from a hesitant tongue. [139]
He polishes because the lanterns must sip dreams, and roughness scratches what should be cradled. [154]
The abbess of the basilica meets him at the threshold and studies his feet, which refuse to cast a twin. [174]
You will find our stairs familiar, she says, because here a pilgrim descends while ascending. [189]
Her palm shows him a spiral map that looks like a whirlpool frozen into glass. [204]
He follows the curve clockwise, and the higher he climbs, the deeper the air becomes, until it tastes of cellars. [224]
Down in the heights, silver kettles hiss, and attendants whisper into the lanterns, practicing dream recording with the devotion of scribes. [245]
Each whisper is a leaf released on water, a memory taught to float without drowning. [260]
The lantern maker asks for a table beneath a pendant canopy of irised panes, where the sun rings are tuned by passing clouds. [283]
There he unpacks the stones and begins to transform them, first with powder, then with felt, then with spit and sleeve. [304]
The basilica answers with a choir of prisms, scattering a meadow of rainbows over his workspace and seeding his lungs with color. [326]
He selects a lens thin as a tea petal and fits it into a lantern body woven from brass reeds. [346]
When the abbess pours jasmine into a shallow bowl, the steam rises and the lens drinks, and the first vision condenses. [367]
It is his own childhood, refracted and strangely calm, a boy in the orchard watching his mother tie ribbons to branches for wind. [390]
Then the vision ruptures, and the shadow he lost walks in, faithful as thunder, and takes the ribbons away. [409]
He remembers the night of detachment: the boat, the mirror river, the moon that would not keep still, the shadow unlatching itself like a door. [434]
Since then, every cup has been either too full or too empty, and the tea garden taught him how to measure in breaths. [457]
He tells the abbess his motive plainly: to fold grief into origami cranes until the flock guides his lost shadow home. [478]
She instructs him to brew the cranes from vapor and glass, because paper here would be too heavy. [496]
So he steeps ribbon leaves, bends their steam into sharp beaks and wings, and lets the lanterns warm their bellies. [516]
With each crane, a shard of ache settles into a feathery knot, then lifts, captured by dream recording the way a needle holds thread. [540]
His hands remember the shapes even when his eyes sting, and the basilica hums like a hive under rain. [559]
Outside, the island shifts in its tether, and the wind moves the tea shrubs in rows like sleeping lungs. [578]
A bell rings, announcing that the stair has turned, and he descends while ascending to the nave where offerings are released. [599]
He carries the warmed lanterns, each with a small flock circling inside, and sets them in a triangle before the altar of sky. [622]
The shadow comes as a ripple of dusk across clear noon, and he bows to it without expectation, only with practiced breath. [644]
The cranes stir, and in their wings he has tucked letters, apologies folded so small that only heat can read them. [665]
As the basilica brightens, their bellies glow, and the messages transform from tight creases into air, and then into change. [685]
A faint hand, made of shade and tea mist, reaches from the nave and touches his chest where the absent weight once hung. [708]
It does not return to him, but it loosens, and the ache no longer drags at the world around his ankles. [729]
He laughs, hoarse as a knotted rope, and the abbess smiles as if sunlight knew grief well enough to pour it evenly. [751]
In the tea garden, guests lift cups that smell of rain on hot stone, and their eyes soften as lanterns drift overhead. [773]
The crafty lantern maker cleans his lenses with careful gem polishing, whispering to himself the names of every ribbon he ever tied. [795]</story>
