<story>The bookstore climbed the mountain like ivy made of pages, a labyrinth of shelves breathing in the high cold. [19]
I arrived after remembering becomes painful, when names flake from the tongue and daylight bends away from the eyes. [38]
They told me a mercury-glass seer lived among the stacks, and that she could map my lost rooms. [56]
The mountain shelved storms behind its quiet; the tone of everything inside held hidden thunder. [71]
Footpaths narrowed into aisles, aisles curled into cul-de-sacs of dictionaries, and the dictionaries muttered where no wind reached. [89]
A boy with inked palms placed a lantern in my hand and warned me to count the shelf-lamps backward. [108]
He said the seer substitutes reality nightly, swapping spines and spires, rewinding the mountain until its story breathes again. [127]
I walked until the lantern burned thin, until the books smelled like old rivers and flint. [143]
The floor sloped, then lifted, as if the mountain were exhaling beneath me, patient as a bellows. [160]
At a landing of lullabies and atlases, I found the mercury-glass seer arranging thin mirrors between folios. [177]
Her eyes held quicksilver; when she breathed, the mirrors trembled, and letters swam like minnows. [192]
You want the shape of home, she said, but first you must know where your mouth was silenced. [210]
I asked her price and offered coin, but she sifted the air with a feather, as if counting rain. [229]
We read via the texture of a feather here, she said, not via the shine of gold. [246]
She placed the feather on my tongue, and its barbs enumerated my forgotten syllables. [260]
Each barb stung a little, like a seed lodged under a fingernail, urging me to plant what I once hid. [280]
She led me to a table of stones that looked like loaves of night, and among them lay the lost language stone. [302]
Its surface held no script, only a sheen like water watching itself. [314]
Touch it, she whispered, and do not think of your address, think of your first shadow. [330]
I touched the stone and a warmth rose, not heat but recognition, the ache of a key searching for a door. [351]
Images unspooled: a courtyard of cracked jars; a woman humming while planting onions; my own mouth refusing to sing. [370]
Because I had once laughed at my accent, I buried it, and with it buried talents that grew wild in silence. [391]
The stone hummed like a throat remembering a lullaby, and the mountain answered with a rumble of approval. [409]
I asked the seer what to do with such clumsy truth, and she set a mirror before the stone. [428]
In the mirror I saw a house made of vowels; doors formed from breaths I had withheld. [445]
Your home has the shape of your mouth, she said, and your rooms are the feelings you refuse to name. [465]
I wanted to deny it, but hidden thunder traveled through the stacks, and a shelf shifted, sighing its assent. [484]
The seer gathered the feather and the stone and asked what I would seed with what I had remembered. [503]
Not seed like a farmer, she clarified, but seed like a sky before rain, the air pregnant with possibility. [522]
I said I would seed my tongue with my old consonants, and seed my steps with my grandmother's measurements of light. [543]
I would seed the mountain with a map no one else could draw, a cartography of forgiven mistakes. [561]
The seer nodded, and for a moment the mercury in her eyes stilled, reflecting a clean horizon. [578]
Then the bookstore shifted its breath; reality thinned like wet vellum, and she began her nightly substitution. [595]
Shelves turned, staircases lengthened; whole biographies migrated into blankness and reappeared as haiku about snowfall. [610]
Hold fast, she said, for your buried talents are surfacing, and the mountain must make room for them. [628]
I clutched the stone and tasted the feather again, gritty with a trace of riverbed, soft with permission. [646]
Words I once exiled returned like neighbors, bringing bowls and songs, asking where to place their coats. [663]
We made room by moving the shame-encyclopedias to the far wall, where their gilt could glimmer without drowning us. [682]
When the mountain settled, the aisles aligned into a corridor shaped like a question mark, the curl pointing east. [701]
Follow that, said the seer, and you will find a door sized for your voice. [716]
I followed, passing shelves labeled Weather Kept in Pockets, and a window that contained only the smell of rain. [735]
At the end stood a door of open air, and beyond it a courtyard of cracked jars from the vision, now whole. [757]
I understood that home was not a dwelling but a practice, a seeding of each day with the forgiven sound. [777]
The mercury-glass seer watched from the threshold as I spoke my first true hello, and the mountain answered. [795]</story>
