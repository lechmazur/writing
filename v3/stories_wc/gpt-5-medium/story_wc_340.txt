<story>The elevator hums like a throat clearing before confession, and I, the ascending servant, rest a hand on its frostbitten rail. [21]
We are rising within the icebound spire above the clouds, and already my breath feels borrowed from cold saints. [40]
They assigned me to retrieve a lost logbook, but my motive is gentler: to seek out the joy beneath anguish. [60]
I have learned that pain is a folded letter that opens if touched by a warmly inquisitive hand. [78]
Floor numbers blink amber, one through ten, and with each slow chime the past begins to unfold. [95]
On the first rise, I fish from my satchel the airship captain's goggles, lens glass crazed like thawing lakes. [114]
They belonged to Captain Mirek, who vanished when his ship skated too close to the spire's blue skin. [132]
Rumor said the diary he kept was encrypted to protect the way joy was smuggled into harsh weather. [150]
On the second rise, frost flowers lace the glass, and the cage lights shatter into coins across the metal. [169]
I angle the goggles to catch them, because his margins hinted that the code is read through scattered light. [188]
A mosaic splashes across my palms, and glyphs I could not see begin to drowse awake. [204]
The diary itself lies wrapped beneath my coat, its leather smelling of whale oil and a promise to return. [223]
On the third rise, I unfold the parcel, and the elevator shudders like a beast remembering its spine. [241]
Affection helps steadiness, so I let my voice hum small reassurances to the bolts, the way a parent calms hinges. [261]
I stay at a slant from Captain Mirek's myth, practicing an affectionate detachment that keeps my hands purposeful. [279]
On the fourth rise, the diary opens, not with a crack, but with a sigh that chooses to be heard. [299]
The pages are filigree, letters woven with tiny slivers of mica, impossible until the light coins pass through. [317]
I lift the goggles, and the markings leap, like fish learning air is another kind of river. [334]
On the fifth rise, Mirek's voice arrives, a soft baritone of notes where words and weather trade shirts. [352]
He writes of passengers he called his strays, and of songs hidden in ballast to smuggle courage between isobars. [371]
On the sixth rise, I see a sketch of the spire, its ice described as a cathedral that forgot applause. [391]
He lists shelves inside like pews, and a ladder he never trusted, and an elevator he called the throat. [410]
I pause, smiling at the kinship, and feel the machine under me grin its toothy gears back. [427]
On the seventh rise, a gust noses the shaft, and snow seeding from above becomes a slow confetti. [445]
I angle the goggles again, and the scattered light reveals a cipher wheel drawn in negative between lines. [463]
He hid keys in his own intolerances, in things he refused to name, so that naming them would free him. [483]
On the eighth rise, laughter appears, a column of figures that are jokes until aligned with my pulse. [501]
The diary is encrypted, yes, but not against thieves; it is encrypted against despair, which reads without affection. [519]
On the ninth rise, a confession: Mirek was a servant too, ascending the same throat with cargo heavier than coal. [539]
He carried passengers' last letters they would never send, and promised to store them somewhere the wind learned mercy. [558]
I realize the shelves I must find hold not supplies but absences folded small, each waiting to unfold in weathered hands. [579]
On the tenth rise, the elevator slows, and the spire's crest glows like an ember nobody dared blow upon. [598]
I step into the chamber of shelves, and it is quiet the way listening is quiet, all breath held for the returning. [620]
There, within niches punched into ice, rest packets of paper and scraps of ribbon, and a tin labeled Weather's Heart. [640]
I hold the diary near them, and the scattered light from the shaft fans across everything like a forgiving hand. [660]
The cipher aligns with the tin's polish, and Mirek's final entry appears, as if coaxed from a stubborn child. [679]
He writes, Keep what breaks you where you can love it without smoke, and teach the sky to carry it gently. [700]
I am only a servant, ascending by assignment, yet I answer aloud that I will, and mean it like winter means clarity. [722]
I do not clutch the letters; I arrange them, warmly inquisitive, curious without trespass, letting grief and laughter share a shelf. [743]
Outside, the airship scars on the ice glimmer, and for a moment the clouds below seem to breathe on cue. [763]
I leave the diary open, because not everything needs locking, and because joy, once found, keeps the bolts from tiring. [783]</story>
