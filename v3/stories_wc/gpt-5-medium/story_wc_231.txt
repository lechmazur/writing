<story>At nautical twilight the dock shone like a smoothed stone, an opal dock in mist where colors hushed themselves to gray vows. [22]
I stood there with the lantern tucked low, listening for the sea to decide what it meant to ask of me. [43]
They call me an eccentric lighthouse keeper, and perhaps that is fair, because I believe the tide keeps its own ledger of names. [66]
Tonight I had only one name to lean toward, and one puzzle to shoulder, to decode a stranger's final gesture. [86]
He had come ashore at dawn with lungs ruined by brine, lifted my sleeve, and pressed something brittle into my palm before slackening. [109]
Not a coin or a note, but a dried Edelweiss boutonniere, its pale star gone the color of old parchment yet still stubborn. [132]
He tapped his chest twice, touched the flower, and then pointed down the dock between the posts where the gulls will not roost. [155]
Those were all the words he could spare, and I have lived in the echo since. [171]
I am a softly persistent man, and if my manners look odd against the beige of the village, then so be it. [193]
I investigate by the only method that has ever yielded light without scaring it away, by observing gaps. [211]
Gaps in stories, gaps in timetables, and the particular gap where a final breath wants to be a letter and fails. [232]
So I began at the opal sheen underfoot, in the seams between planks, where we hide secrets we are too gentle to bury. [255]
By the third piling I found a notch rubbed bright, as if something often knocked there in coded patience. [274]
I held the dried Edelweiss boutonniere to it, and the tiny stems settled perfectly into the wear, like a key fitting a tired lock. [298]
The pointing, then, was not toward the fog or the harbor mouth, but toward this small appointment between wood and absence. [319]
I crouched and peered along the grain until I saw the scratch marks that were too regular to be rats. [339]
They were letters without letters, little chevrons where some sailor without ink had practiced sending himself home. [356]
This was when the first of my borrowed memories rose, unasked, because this dock knows my hands like kin and gives back what I have touched. [382]
I remembered a girl fifteen years gone who wore an Edelweiss on a winter coat, though she had never seen a mountain. [404]
She waited here, nights when the ice chimed, sending little knocks with a nail so that a man far away at sea would know she kept faith. [431]
She pressed the boutonniere into the notch the night he did not return, and the dock took that pain into its timber to keep it from drowning. [458]
Witnessed isolation has a weight to it, a careful temperature that does not burn but never quite warms. [476]
I felt that weight settle now, not as grief for myself, but as an accounting I had agreed to keep for the sea and its stubborn dead. [503]
The stranger had copied her gestures, but inverted them, tapping his own chest and then the flower, as if to say the signal runs both ways. [529]
He needed me to investigate his silence, to read his gap as meaning, to answer with light what his lips could not carry. [552]
So I set the dried Edelweiss boutonniere into the notch, aligned the stems to the old scratches, and climbed the iron steps back to my glass. [578]
Above, I swung the lantern three times slow and once long, the way the girl had once asked me to try when she still waited here. [604]
It is a foolish code by charts, but the gulls went quiet, and the mist pulled itself into ribbons, and from the harbor bar a low light answered. [632]
Perhaps a fishing sloop passing in, perhaps only a reflection of my own glass, but I took it for the reply he had wanted. [656]
I wrote his name as best I could hear it from the cough he carried, scratched it into the ledger, and folded the page around a salt packet. [684]
Then I swept the dock so the notch would look like any other aging flaw, because what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness. [711]
The night kept its steady breathing, and I kept mine, an eccentric lighthouse keeper doing his best work by observing gaps. [732]
Here on the opal dock in mist, at nautical twilight and later, I hold the flower and the light like a promise that can be borrowed but not owned. [761]
It is enough for me that somewhere the answer felt its way through, and that his final gesture did not vanish unnoticed into the hunger of the sea. [789]</story>
