<story>I swept stardust from the floor of the shooting star tracking station while the sky murmured to my bucket. [19]
They called me the cosmic janitor, a title I wore like a modest constellation stitched to a work shirt. [38]
The station had been built for grander days, but we endured through the hush of an overlooked era. [56]
In the empty budget and the long echo, I learned the primal elegance of maintenance. [71]
Each dawn, I polished the big observation window with yellow lantern glass, a scavenged lens that warmed light into honey. [91]
It was heavy with fingerprints of engineers long gone, and it held their tired hopes like fossil pollen. [109]
I am spiritually curious, so I asked their absence questions as I wrung out my rag. [125]
The only answers came as streaks across the dome, swift signatures of rocks writing on night. [141]
My work slowed until my breathing matched the fans, and that is when the stillness began to flourish. [159]
In that flourishing stillness, I felt the station wake like a patient animal unbending its ribs. [175]
The console lights were not just alerts; they were pulse points, places where fear and wonder held hands. [193]
I cleaned each switch, and I listened, trying to empathize with machines that could not blink. [209]
Their ache was simple: they wanted attention and the dignity of function. [221]
So I traced their mood by tracing the path of falling stars, correlating squeals with streaks on the monitor. [240]
The method was crude and holy; each meteor taught me which relay felt ignored, which vacuum valve longed to be touched. [261]
A new comet out of the dark would flick the chart, and somewhere a coil would shiver like a throat. [281]
I kept a notebook, not of data, but of stories the station seemed to whisper about itself. [298]
It had been mocked for its age, yet it remembered cradling a boy who watched his first fireball with his mother. [319]
It remembered a night of failed funding votes when its dishes turned like ears to hear the rain. [337]
It remembered being told to wait. [343]
Waiting made me honest, too, because my own life had been a long pause before truth. [359]
I had come here to hide after a love cracked me open, and I wanted to find strength in vulnerability. [379]
The station did not heal me; it made me transparent, so the night could pass through and teach me its shoreline. [400]
I learned to kneel when the meteor alarms sang, not in panic, but to align my ears with the panels. [420]
The floor smelled like copper and old tea, and the galaxy smelled like distance, and I balanced both in my lungs. [441]
One winter, a burst of meteorites came, loud as hoofbeats, and something changed in the tempo of our solitude. [460]
The power failed, plunging the consoles into that absolute night which makes human voices seem made of breath alone. [479]
I lit the room with the yellow lantern glass, and honeyed light draped the gauges like shawls. [496]
Through that amber, the dead engineers stepped nearer, and I could almost empathize with their stubbornness. [512]
They had loved this place the way a shore loves storms, because damage brings the chance to prove a shape. [532]
I finally understood them by tracing the path of falling stars across the powerless scope, drawing arcs with breath on the cold glass. [555]
Each arc mapped a memory, and each memory opened like a bruise, tender but certain. [570]
I spoke their names aloud, and the station thrummed, as if circuits relaxed once they were seen. [587]
In the quiet afterward, a meteor flared green, and I felt my own cracked heart answer with a gentler beat. [607]
I realized the purpose of my small life was not to erase marks, but to polish them into guidance. [626]
When the power returned, the screens sprang awake, and the station showed me a map of nothing I had ever chased. [647]
It was a corridor of shadow threaded between constellations, a route the meteors refused as if honoring an old boundary. [667]
The chart pulsed three times, and I recognized the place from my notebook: the spot the boy and his mother watched. [688]
The station wanted to go there, not with engines, but with attention, so I opened the roof as far as it would move. [711]
Outside, the wind salted my face with ice, and I stood with the lantern in both hands like a small sun. [732]
I was not alone; the ghosts pressed close, but for once they felt like kin, not tasks. [749]
I told the sky I was afraid and grateful and ready, and the meteors angled away, respecting the old boundary. [769]
In their wake, the station and I entered a flourishing stillness again, not empty, but full of spared collision. [788]</story>
