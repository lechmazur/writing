<story>The sea around the trench spread in lonesome splendor, a cathedral of pressure and blue that swallowed the lights of my skiff. [22]
They call me the distress signal sender, the one who keeps a pulse alive when machines die and voices are lost to salt. [45]
Tonight the submersible rests crippled behind me, anchored to a fissure by a line I dared not cut, its crew drowsy on dwindling air. [69]
The only hope waits ahead, a forgotten underwater temple the charts insisted was myth, now yawning in the crack like a mouth that has swallowed prayers. [95]
In its nave, the old survey notes whispered, acoustics fold on themselves, a gathered hush that hums at frequencies fish avoid but signals love to ride. [121]
I swim toward it with the spooled transmitter on my belt and the crystal perfume vial glinting in my glove like a tiny captured moon. [146]
The vial is loot from a dredged armoire, its stopper chipped, its belly etched with herbs and swans, but its emptiness carries a peculiar gravity. [171]
When I hold it to currents, it touches memories, a breath of someone else's lilacs, a corridor of summers, even the sharpness of a goodbye I never lived. [199]
That is why I brought it into these deeps, to harness the ephemeral and bend it toward rescue, to ask perfume to sing the mathematics of need. [226]
The temple doors lie toppled, slabs crusted with anemones that blink like patient eyes, and beyond them hallways open, ribboning inward with a tired, regal pace. [252]
I know sound will nest here, if I can just unsnarl the tangled lines dragging behind, and set the transmitter where the hush coalesces into chord. [278]
But panic paddles my ribs when the corridor narrows, when stone teeth scrape my tank, when the silt swallows my lamp into a bruise of brown. [304]
I stop, not from wisdom but by overriding instinct, the way a skater keeps from flailing on thin ice by becoming a single held note. [329]
My breath slows, the silt settles, and the gathered hush of the nave sidles close, as though it were a shy animal trained to prayer. [354]
I hear the ocean subtract itself from the room, leaving space for a higher echo that clips and returns like a hand testing walls. [378]
With fingers numb in the cold, I unsnarl the line and loop it against a column, feeling fragile relief as the drag on my torso eases. [404]
I nestle the transmitter on a frieze where fish once were carved, and take out the crystal perfume vial, floating it in front of my mask. [430]
A soft current moves through, and the vial fills with nothing, and yet that nothing carries a soundless bouquet that touches memories I am still becoming. [456]
I think of the crew, open-mouthed in their sleep, of my sister who taught me to listen for machines, of the cliff-side lilacs we pretended were clouds. [483]
Time taps me on the shoulder; as time runs short, the gauge needles inch toward warning, and the slow weight of depth feels suddenly like a hand. [510]
I pop the vial's stopper, aim the transmitter's coil into its mouth, and exhale through my teeth, shaping the emergency tones like a prayer taught backward. [536]
The hush gathers tighter, habituated to the temple's curve, and the call rides it outward, braided with those scents the ocean does not forget. [560]
I feel the signal take, a subtle tug in the line, as if some unseen surface had replied by plucking the thread that binds me here. [586]
A surge swarms the doorway, trying to tear me loose, and instinct screams to kick and claw, but I steady myself again by overriding instinct, becoming stillness. [613]
In that stillness I hear the temple remember, and the line sings along the columns, and the transmitter thrums with an answer far above my head. [639]
The boat will find us, I tell myself, and I think of charts redrawn, of passwords broken, of the lonesome splendor that kept watch when we forgot. [666]
I cork the vial and tie it to my chest, a small bell of collected silence, a reminder that rescue was coaxed from what refuses to be held. [694]
Then I turn and swim for the fissure, hauling the line toward the crippled sub, proud and afraid, the temple fading behind me like a star at noon. [722]</story>
