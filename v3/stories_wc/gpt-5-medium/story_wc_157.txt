<story>After thoughts became taxable, the air itself felt like a meter clicking over your head. [15]
I learned to breathe sideways in an entomologist's greenhouse, where bees muddied the taxman's antennae. [30]
They called me a charming rogue scholar after the university dismissed me for annotating the dean's dreams with footnotes. [49]
It was not malice, only a candidly cryptic habit of answering questions with maps. [63]
When thought turned billable, my footnotes became contraband, and movements had to stand guard over their own sparks of defiance. [83]
So I founded a secret language club among the vines and the glass, and we spoke in petal, shade, and wing. [104]
Dr. Kline, whose ants could count and whose eyes were soft as moths, lent us the greenhouse after hours. [123]
She said truth looks better in chitin and pollen. [132]
I carried a gourd rattle seed in my pocket as a reminder that noise can grow. [148]
Old festivals used those gourds to summon dancers; we would use them to summon sentences. [163]
The tax ministry had installed audit towers that tasted cognition in the ionized haze above neighborhoods. [179]
If you planned a kiss or a poem too loudly, a surcharge arrived by dusk. [194]
We learned to warp the space between thoughts, to lay silence like mulch, and to let the bees carry the rest. [215]
Our method was simple and treasonous: joining community gardens to plant message patterns the towers would ignore as landscaping. [234]
Calendula for consonants, beans for vowels, trellis angles for syntax, irrigation timers for rhythm. [248]
At night, I traced the city's allotments on my desk and stitched routes with thread, a warp of stolen twine to guide our planters. [272]
By day, we taught hands to sow in cursive and taught minds to keep a straight face under the blooming joke. [293]
You cannot audit what you read as petals. [301]
You cannot fine a sentence if it feeds butterflies. [310]
Still, the city felt the converging chaos of too many rehearsed silences and too many hungry dreams. [327]
Collectors in gray walked with drone umbrellas, and the towers grew new teeth against the sky. [343]
The night they came for Kline's permits, a hornworm outbreak surged like a green river across the benches, as if summoned by law. [366]
Moths slapped at the glass, mantises teetered like monks, and the temperature rose until sweat became a second language. [385]
I rattled my pocket and felt the gourd rattle seed click against my key, a blunt syllable of memory. [404]
That seed had rolled under a ladder at the last harvest march, when a baton cracked drumskin and laughter cracked fear. [425]
I had kept it to remind myself why I plotted, which was to stand guard over your own spark of defiance without asking permission. [449]
Kline met me under the fig trellis, where the auditors' microphones hummed like worried flies. [464]
She said, My ants will carry only what they can lift, which is enough for any revolution that knows how to share. [486]
I cupped the seed, shook a dry whisper, and told the club to form lines. [501]
We would join every garden we had ever mapped, and we would plant the verdict we had researched from the footnotes of law. [524]
Artistic rehearsal, the code said in a forgotten clause, renders thought tax-exempt if the intention is performed in public. [543]
We would turn thinking into a garden concert no auditor could price. [555]
Our pattern read, when viewed from the overflying drones, RATTLE CHOIR TONIGHT, each letter grown in marigold and wax bean. [575]
Kline released a wave of lacewings, and their hunger for aphids wrote shimmering punctuation over the beds. [592]
We opened the side doors and let the neighbors in, their coins ready to pay for carrots, their minds ready to sing for free. [616]
I stood on a crate and spoke candidly cryptic, which is to say I told the truth with ellipses that invited you to finish it. [641]
We shook the dried gourds until the seeds inside became rain, and the drones above misfiled the sound as weather. [661]
Choir is a word for community that the law still respects; rattle is a word for alarm that plants can grow. [682]
The collectors arrived in their gray, and the greenhouse turned into converging chaos, wingbeats, footsteps, leaf shadows, a thinking storm. [702]
I felt the seed in my palm like a small planet, and understood that a message should be heavier than a lie. [724]
We sang the rights clause in round, and we planted one more line at the threshold, a ribbon of beans spelling ENTER. [746]
The officers had to step over it and laugh, and in laughing they performed an intention with us and canceled their own levy. [769]
By the time they realized, the bees had already carried our refrain to every joined garden, a citywide warp of notes. [790]
A garden keeps the spark, and we keep watch. [799]</story>
