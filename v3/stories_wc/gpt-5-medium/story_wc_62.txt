<story>At dusk the ancient greenhouse breathed a thundering calm, glass ribs singing like tide, as I set my tools on the potting bench. [23]
I am a thoughtful gravestone carver, and tonight the names waiting in marble sounded like waves learning to rest. [42]
People bring me their dead and their surviving, and I try to discover the shape of collective grief without breaking it. [63]
To keep my hands true, I come here before dinner, when wind threads the fern shadows and soil holds the day at arm's length. [87]
I unspooled a woven ribbon roll from my satchel, a habit from apprenticeships, to measure breath and silence between letters. [107]
Each notch along the ribbon was marked with a poem line, because my family keeps a custom of trading favorite poems at dinner. [130]
We pass bowls and verses alike, tasting while reciting, and meaning learns to sit at the table without taking too much space. [152]
I am fiercely meditative when I work, but the poem marks loosen my grip on certainty and invite the air to contribute. [174]
The butterflies had begun their orange river north last week, and my mother said the season would carry a lesson if I let it. [198]
She died two winters ago, but in the greenhouse she visits as a hush that teaches, a spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel. [221]
When the last patrons left their stones this afternoon, I promised the air I would retrace their stories carefully and set each to its distance. [246]
Inside, condensation made small planets on the panes and the dirt path glowed faintly, as if the floor remembered sunlight the way skin remembers touch. [271]
I tested the first name, a seafarer, by placing the ribbon against the stone and reading the stitched line about an oar put away. [295]
The chisel followed the seam of that line, and the greenhouse accepted each tap as a measured tide that would not drown the seedlings. [319]
When I paused, the hush changed, and I knew my mother was near, less a ghost than a gust steering me from too much ornament. [344]
She had taught me that names want enough silence to grow around them, the way roots refuse bricks and find the earth's forgiving gaps. [368]
While I carved, butterflies tested the cracked roof and circled the vines, a drifting congregation reminding me the work must stretch across the butterfly migration. [393]
Grief migrates as well, I thought, not in a line but in widening rings, and the stone has to bear those distances like a map. [418]
A father came at dusk to watch me begin his daughter's marker, and he stood beside the lettuce beds because he said the smell steadied him. [444]
He did not cry; the thundering calm inside the greenhouse wrapped us, and he asked if I knew any words strong enough to hold the date. [470]
I offered the ribbon and invited him to choose a notch, and he picked the one stitched with his daughter's first poem about a falling kite. [496]
We stood there, trading favorite poems as if the table had stretched into the greenhouse, and he found a breath that did not shatter itself. [521]
I set the letters shallow at first, then deeper when his hand steadied on the bench, and the hush of my mother approved the pacing. [546]
As the weeks traveled and the migration moved like a sky-borne loom, I returned nightly, each stone another square in a quilt I could not finish. [572]
Spectral mentorship turned specific: my mother's lessons arrived as drafts through the broken vents, pointing me to carve pauses where families had none left to spare. [598]
Sometimes she sent butterflies to land on the exact syllable to soften, and their feet were commas trembling with the authority of mercy. [621]
Other nights I had to retrace a curve wasted by haste, and I heard the greenhouse creak in disapproval, a stern choir that kept me honest. [647]
In the middle of the season, a storm tested the roof, yet nothing inside broke, as if grief itself held the panes together to spare the seedlings. [674]
The father returned with a loaf and a new poem cut from his daughter's notebook, and we arranged crumbs and lines along the potting bench like offerings. [701]
He asked how I could bear so many names without becoming stone, and I told him the ribbons keep moving even when the chisels go still. [727]
Movement, my mother breathed, is the shape of our collective grief, not progress, but a steadied returning to each other like tide among the roots. [752]
The last of the butterflies lifted beyond the city one ash gold evening, and I finished the daughter's stone by setting her kite in a single spare curve. [780]</story>
