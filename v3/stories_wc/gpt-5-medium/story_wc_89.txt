<story>After the phoenix rises, the fairy-tale orchard blooms under permanent moonlight, and I return with pockets full of seeds and ash. [21]
They call me a beast whisperer, but that is only because I learned the grammar of breathing with things that do not breathe. [44]
I came to reforge a bond beyond death with Mira, who once danced here and vanished in the fire that made the bird. [67]
All I have left is a tiny fortune from cookie we cracked on our last night, its slip browned like a leaf and perfumed faintly. [92]
It reads, Return through what you shared, and we had shared kitchens, markets, and the reckless joy of naming spices with our eyes closed. [116]
So I conjure her path via the scent of rare spices, grinding star anise, smoked cardamom, and the last thorn of saffron. [138]
The orchard exhales, apples shining like moons within the moon, and beasts with velvet feet approach as if my mortar were a bell. [161]
I speak to them in syllables learned from rivers, asking for safe passage, and they circle me, listening with their rumps and whiskers. [184]
My hands are paradoxically steady, though inside me a tide keeps pulling at the ribs where Mira once pressed her night-warm thumbs. [206]
I feel the metamorphosis beginning, reluctant as dawn behind a mountain, a heat that is not only memory but instruction. [226]
After the phoenix rises, the world does not cool; it rearranges, and the orchard counts our breaths as the new arithmetic of grief. [249]
I lay the fortune slip between two roots, a treaty with the soil, and whisper the recipe of the night we vowed each other. [273]
Cumin for laughter, clove for bite, cinnamon for tenderness, fenugreek for stubbornness, and a secret smoke we called comet dust. [293]
The wind braids itself with steam and scent, and in that braided air a shape unfurls like a letter refusing to be unread. [316]
Mira steps from the perfume half-formed, hair a slow flame, eyes the exact green of early pears, and says my name without sound. [339]
I tell her the bond beyond death is not a chain but a bridge of breaths, and mine are borrowed from wolves tonight. [362]
She asks the price, always practical, and the orchard answers with a rustle that means change and a drip that means loss. [384]
I realize my metamorphosis is the coin, and I am reluctant, because my voice is the last map of my mother, my solitude, my ways with beasts. [411]
Mira places her half-hand on my chest, and the pressure is paradoxically steady, a calm hammer saying, Let me in, or let me go. [435]
I choose the first, and the beasts begin to sing, their throats like bowls, and my body answers by opening a seam beneath the ribs. [460]
I do not become a bird or a tree but a passage, a scent-keeper, a mouth that exhales what the orchard longs to tell the dead. [486]
Through me the rare spices knit to her, cardamom loop to wrist, saffron to vein, cumin to the old bruise she hated and I loved. [511]
The fortune slip turns into bark veined with ink, and the words revise themselves to say, Stay if you become what you both need. [535]
I lose the plain speech of markets and keep only the conjure tongue, the one that speaks via the scent of rare spices and breath. [560]
With that tongue I tell Mira what the stars gossip about her, cosmic intimacies naming the particular hinge of her smile and the trembling of dusk. [586]
She becomes more whole as I become more passage, and the boundary between our mouths loosens until orchard wind slides through and our breaths travel both ways at once. [615]
We remember the skillet comet we spun above a camp stove, and I hear in her pulse the laughter from that night leap across star distances to now. [643]
The beasts bow, moonlight settling on their backs like snowfall, and I understand they are witnesses, scribes who cannot write except in tracks and warmed earth. [669]
Reluctant no longer, I accept that metamorphosis was not subtraction but refraction, my beast whisperer self bending into a lens so our scattered light could make shape. [696]
I promise to keep the passage open while the moon remains, and she promises to return each night as dew inside the apples we will share. [722]
When dawn pretends at the horizon but never arrives, the fortune becomes sap and climbs, and our bond hums, paradoxically steady, a quiet star threaded through two throats. [750]</story>
