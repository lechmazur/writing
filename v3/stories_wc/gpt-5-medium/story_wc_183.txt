<story>Fog muffled the carousel bells aboard the abandoned carnival ship drifting in a foggy bay, and the whole vessel exhaled like a sleeping animal daring not to wake. [28]
I had introduced myself to its empty decks as a chimera twin discoverer, yet my curiosity felt like trapped freedom, a key that would not fit any lock. [56]
As memories alter, the bay folded back time, and the ship slid slowly across it the way a memory slips beneath a new narration. [80]
In my pocket lay an emerald swatch card stolen from the city archives, a color sample from a vanished banner rumored to point toward the garden of forgotten names. [109]
I had come to find the garden of forgotten names, and I believed the card was not pigment but permission. [129]
Somewhere on this ship, I sensed an unkindled solace, a hearth unlit that waited for a story to strike it like flint. [151]
My plan was simple: to recapture the path hidden in the card through narrative threads, weaving rooms and footsteps into chapters until the garden itself turned the page. [179]
The funhouse mirrors were clouded, the midway prizes furred with salt, and the ferris wheel leaned like a compass needle resting on the lip of the world. [206]
From a ticket booth cracked with barnacles, a voice that was mine and not-mine proposed a route, blissfully aberrant, like laughter in a chapel. [230]
I had always cataloged anomalies, but on this deck I discovered my chimera twin inside my own tongue, and the discoverer in me wrote their name in air. [258]
As memories alter, the echo grew older or younger depending on which doorway I passed, and the ship kept adjusting its corridors like a host setting a table. [286]
I held the emerald swatch card to the dim bulbs, and their green reflections mapped constellations onto the boards, suggesting a walk that would end where the water began. [315]
Show me the garden of forgotten names, I whispered to the booth, and the not-mine voice answered, You knew it once, but the price was that you would forget. [344]
That bargain crawled over my skin like a net, a trapped freedom tightening each time I struggled, loosening only when I stood still and listened. [369]
The carousel horses had lost their paint, but when the emerald gleam touched their eyes they bucked gently, then pointed their noses toward a curtained hatch. [395]
I stepped after them, stitching my footsteps through narrative threads I could almost see, filaments of rumor and rumor's mother, all tugging me downstairs. [419]
The room below was a dim museum of prizes, and as I crossed it I felt the old obsession to recapture a childhood prize I never won and could not name. [450]
As memories alter, the shelves rearranged until the missing prize became a jar of damp soil, labeled with the smeared ink of a name that might once have been mine. [480]
I held the jar close and saw how cold it was, the unkindled solace sleeping in it, and I wondered whose breath would be the spark. [506]
My not-mine voice said, The garden of forgotten names is where our halves root, and for each name you speak, you lose the twin you tried to discover. [534]
To go forward I had to decide whether to be a discoverer or a person, and even in that the chimera twisted, because I had been both so long. [563]
I climbed to the bow, where carnival letters peeled and fog clung like moths, and beyond the rail the bay opened into a bruise-colored circle of hush. [590]
I set the emerald swatch card against the horizon, and through it saw a hidden shore erupt into terraces of leaves, each leaf etched with a trembling name. [618]
Trapped freedom thrummed in my ribs because the ship could not dock, yet the garden drifted closer like a host approaching with a tray and asking for a story. [647]
I spoke my history through narrative threads, not facts but bridges, and as memories alter the garden leaned in to listen, a shoreline bending its ear. [673]
I took the jar, poured the soil onto my palm, and recaptured only the silence of a name unsaid, then breathed until the unkindled solace woke like dawnfire. [701]
The leaves shook and spelt nothing, which was everything, and my chimera twin discoverer self unclasped, one hand letting go of the ledger while the other planted the empty jar. [731]
The ship swung in the fog as though released and held, and I set the emerald swatch card above my heart, a compass that pointed toward whoever I would become. [761]</story>
