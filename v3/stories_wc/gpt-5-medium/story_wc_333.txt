<story>I hired the enigmatic locksmith because everyone else said my door had no lock, only a silence that would not open. [21]
He arrived unassumingly bold, a small man with a satchel of glinting picks and a gaze that weighed what speech would only disorient. [44]
He asked what I kept locked, and I said it was not a thing, but an idea trapped behind fear itself always. [66]
It stuck behind fear like fog trapped in a jar, pressing outward, filming every surface of thought until desire fogged into dread. [88]
He nodded, as if doors and ideas were siblings, and asked me to bring the object that most wanted the idea freed. [110]
I brought him a lock of hair tied with ribbon, cut from my mother on the night she left and promised to return. [133]
She had smiled with improbable longing, and the smile stayed, darkened, a crescent on my memory that I mistook for a door. [155]
The locksmith bowed to the ribbon as if to a judge, then to the hair as if to a witness burdened by enveloped secrets. [179]
He asked me to follow him when the daylight thinned to violet, to a place he called the shadowed nexus under starlight. [201]
There, the idea would have room to turn without shattering the house I had built around its careful tremble. [220]
We left as the streetlamps flared and the sky loosened its blue, walking across the hush of cosmic possibility like river stones. [242]
He did not speak, and I found that quiet contagious, as if absence were a language that allowed breath to rearrange. [263]
We reached a weir of shadows where alleyways funneled into a courtyard paved with broken mirrors, each piece tilted toward a different star. [286]
The locksmith told me to wait for a hint given by first star seen at twilight, and to keep my eyes soft. [308]
When the first point pricked the velvet dusk, the broken mirrors angled themselves, and a path formed from shards bright as wet teeth. [331]
He stepped forward, placing the lock of hair at the path's start, and asked me to speak my mother's promise without her words. [354]
I said it as feeling, a warmth that strained toward a door that did not exist, and he nodded like a hinge. [376]
He opened his satchel and took out no tool at all, only a thin silence he laid over the ribbon like gauze. [398]
The courtyard bent, and for a moment the mirrors showed me not my face but the rooms where I had hid my wanting. [421]
It was enough to disorient the habit that guarded me from the idea, that stodgy sentinel who equated safety with no, always no. [444]
The locksmith whispered that a lock is made of belief, and that the right belief can swivel in its housing and open. [466]
He asked me to hold the hair and remember what it was before it was a keepsake: a thing that grew without permission. [489]
I remembered the tug of combs, my mother cursing softly, then laughing, saying the wildness meant I would never belong to borders. [511]
Something inside the ribbon loosened, not the knot itself but the history that had cinched it, and the mirrors inhaled as though relieved. [534]
The locksmith took my hands and turned them palms up, arranging fingers as if aligning tumblers, and asked what idea wanted freeing tonight. [557]
I told him it was the idea that I could sing the loss into a beginning, not a wound, and invite others close. [580]
Fear had kept that idea behind my teeth like a prisoner, insisting my voice was a cracked vessel no one should drink from. [603]
He smiled and told me to sing anyway, because doors learn from daring, and because the sky was listening with unspent room for echoes. [627]
I sang a note that wavered, searching its own hallway, and the mirrors aligned into a cathedral that remembered every whisper I had swallowed. [651]
The ribbon slipped free and fluttered like a moth, the hair lifted, and the courtyard filled with my mother walking back toward me. [674]
Not her body, but the idea of return, finally freed, reached through the cold that had held my tongue and warmed it. [696]
I sang her promise back to the sky, and the sky hummed in answer, and the locksmith bowed as if hearing a latch settle. [720]
He said the work was not to make truth appear, but to free it from fear's wrapping, and let it walk under starlight. [743]
I asked what I owed him, and he laughed softly, saying that payment was the song continuing wherever I went, unafraid of doors. [766]
He gathered the ribbon, now light as first snow, and tucked it into his satchel, carrying away only what no longer bound. [788]</story>
