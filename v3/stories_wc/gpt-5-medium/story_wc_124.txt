<story>I broker lanterns, and tonight my wares lead me into the greenhouse for extinct plants. [15]
Crystal shadows cut the aisles like cooled music, and moisture beads on the glass like quiet breath. [32]
I am a wistful lantern broker because light passes through what I cannot keep, and still I sell it. [51]
My work makes me aromatically cautious, for nights among botanists taught me how smells stir uninvited storms. [68]
Some storms, I learned, arrive wearing sachets of grief like badges. [79]
I come because Marla, the keeper, requested a rare lamp whose beam can switch from warm amber to ultraviolet revealing. [99]
She meets me between ferns that will never see their kind again, and she smells faintly of cedar. [117]
"You came," she says, "because you are brave about darkness and careful about air." [131]
I want to understand why some smells trigger tears, I tell her, and it is not bravery. [148]
It is hunger for meaning in the fog that rises when memory dissolves into scent. [163]
Marla nods and leads me past labels etched with ghosts: amberhorn, dusk sage, glass ivy. [178]
All their living cousins vanished before we learned why their perfumes comforted some and crushed others. [194]
My mother wore one I could never place, and after she died I kept a crystal perfume vial. [212]
I keep it empty because the smallest remnant buckles me to the floor. [225]
Marla unlocks a case and shows me a flower like a shard of dawn, sleeping under gauze. [242]
Its buds hold oils engineered from pollen caught before the last wildfire, distilled into silence. [257]
People donate tears when it opens, she says, as if the mouth of grief needed feeding. [273]
I pass her the ultralight lantern with the dial that clicks from hearth to forensic, and the greenhouse deepens. [292]
Ultraviolet revealing washes the leaves, and hidden veins glow like maps to unfamiliar childhoods. [306]
She hands me gloves and asks about the vial, which hangs at my chest like an unplayed bell. [324]
I open it, empty as a stopped story, and the room fills with the absent smell I cannot bear. [343]
My eyes sting with a phantom, and I grieve the way one does for rain during drought on the lungs. [363]
Marla studies the vial under the lamp, then gasps as faint script appears where glass once seemed pure. [381]
Ultraviolet revealing teases letters from the crystal, the way sunrise teases faces from fogged windows. [396]
My mother etched a name I never knew to ask: amberhorn, and a date that matches my earliest memory of thunder. [417]
I remember a storm ripping the power, lanterns blooming along the stair, and her scent holding the dark together. [436]
The lanterns were my first trade, the scent my first bankruptcy. [447]
Marla whispers that the flower here is the last ambershade variant, a cousin whose perfume curves toward amberhorn. [465]
If I wait, it will open, and perhaps the air will draw a clean map across my hurt. [483]
We prepare as caretakers prepare, not as shoppers do, because science has hands that tremble for different reasons. [501]
She hums a cooling song, and I adjust filters until the crystal shadows thicken like patient ink. [518]
I angle the lantern toward the bud as the transformation completes, and the petals unlock with disciplined lightning. [536]
A feathered vapor climbs, not a cloying sweetness but a tone like rain on crystal, shadows inside brightness. [554]
It touches the place in me where my mother folded the world, and I understand the impact of memories. [573]
They are not visits from the past but currents that shape present shores, scouring and laying sand in the same breath. [594]
My tears answer, not with panic, but like rain returning to a river that had been walking empty. [612]
Marla collects a single drop for the archive because grief, measured gently, tells the soil how we live. [630]
She seals it beside pollen, lights, and dates, and writes that this is how lantern brokers learn to breathe. [649]
I offer her the ultraviolet lantern as payment, because I have other lights, but this one knows my name. [668]
She refuses, insisting instead on a promise to return when other buds begin their subtle rehearsals. [684]
I agree, because understanding is not a purchase but a schedule one keeps with the living and the gone. [703]
As I leave, the greenhouse lingers upon me, fragranced by patient decay, disciplined bloom, and the humility of careful light. [723]
Outside, a drizzle tows the city into focus, and my steps set soft lanterns swinging along puddles. [740]
I touch the crystal perfume vial, no longer a trap but a compass, its blankness pointing toward what I can bear. [761]
I will return when the lamps are needed, and when the garden requests a witness to its quiet transformations. [780]
Until then, memory walks beside me like patient flame, and the night smells of work finally named. [797]</story>
