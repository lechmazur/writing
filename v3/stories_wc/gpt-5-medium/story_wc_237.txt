<story>The platform drifts like a slow leaf, a floating rock tea ceremony platform suspended over acres of cloud. [18]
Wind skims its rim, then bows away, and the world folds into a saturated hush. [33]
I kneel on the basalt with the kit my mentor loaned me, a crow quill trimmed tip, a brush stiff as winter reed, and a pot of ink that crystallizes when stressed. [65]
I am a budding rune scholar, which means I am mostly made of earnest errors and a few bright hunches. [85]
Across the sky, thunderhead walls brood, one bruised procession behind me, another ahead, and all I have is a breath between storms. [107]
The rite must be done during a held breath, the old instructions say, as if lungs could be sandglasses and panic a bell. [130]
I have come here to transform scars into stories, to thread what hurt me into letters that can name their weather. [151]
The first steam curls from the kettle, and I picture how stories are brewed, one patient spill at a time. [171]
I steady my hands and remember our village tea teacher, who said leaves need to feel you listening before they will speak. [193]
Some call this magic; others call it manners guided by the patient. [205]
The storm line grumbles, but the platform holds, tethered by invisible script cut into the underside rock long before I was born. [227]
My mentor said those anchors were carved by a woman who taught herself letters by revisiting youthful superstitions. [245]
She traced the paths she refused to step on as a child and turned them into lines that carried islands. [265]
I lift the cup and take the first sip, counting to seven because I once believed seven kept lightning from finding roofs. [287]
By that small faith, the air steadies, and my pulse unlatches a notch. [300]
I dip the crow quill trimmed tip into the ink and feel the weight of everything I have not yet told. [321]
The first rune is for the burn scar on my left wrist from the summer of the broken kiln. [340]
I place the quill above the cup so the steam can carry the curve as if smoke were a page. [360]
It is a small bend like a wrist learning to forgive heat. [372]
When my heart knocks, the ink on the quill crystallizes when stressed, blooming tiny facets that reflect the stormlight into the cup. [394]
Each facet is a shard of old fear, and each shard is a window. [408]
I breathe in the steam and hold it, beginning the minute I have promised, the minute that will have to be a life. [431]
My lungs become gates, and the gates close with ceremony. [441]
Within that enclosure, memory rises with the tea, and I see the kiln door, the crack leaping to my skin like a quick handwriting. [465]
I had run because a friend dared me, and I had not told the truth because shame speaks faster than honesty when scorched. [488]
Now I let the rune swell, and the vapor carries it to the cup where the surface tightens like a held eyelid. [510]
I set the cup on the tray and bow to the empty seat opposite me, the space I keep for the person I was. [534]
She would knock wood eight times before dawn exams and blow three times into bottles to trap nightmares. [552]
I pour for her, and in the swirling pattern I watch the second rune gather itself from tiny frost, a mark for the cut on my ankle from a river stone. [583]
We were told that river spirits follow those who disrespect their beds, so we whispered thank you and shed our sandals before each crossing, but I forgot once. [611]
The water took a taste and left a reminder, which I have mostly covered with jokes. [627]
The rune glitters and settles on the tea like a name recognizing itself. [640]
My chest is starting to burn, but I have another to draw, the one for the long scar on my back that taught me to bend. [666]
Lightning writes across the horizon, and its flicker gives me a metronome. [678]
I think of the time I would not apologize to my sister, and the roof leaked for a week, and I decided apology is a kind of weatherwork. [706]
By revisiting youthful superstitions, I am not returning to fear but to the doorways fear traced in chalk so I could one day step through. [731]
The last rune is a long line that humbles itself before the cup, then rises, a small spine teaching itself to stand. [753]
My breath thunders in its cage, and I let the steam lift the line into the tea where all three float like petals that happen to be alphabets. [781]
With my last scrap of air, I drink, and the read letters settle in me as warmth slowly. [799]</story>
