<story>At the edge of our harbor, I am the precise local clock tower winder, ethically diligent beyond habit. [18]
The tower leans over a tidal obsidian ridge where black glass breathes with the moon and swallows confessions. [36]
I climb before dawn, a searing reverie burning behind my eyes like the memory of a missed chime. [54]
Above, the clock tower pendulum bob waits in its arc, brass scarred by salt, heavy with everyone's minutes. [72]
Today I mean to stop it exactly at the turning point, during the pause in a pendulum's swing. [90]
We need the city and the stones to keep the same time, to restore shared balance after months of drift. [110]
Storms broke shoreline markers, and arguments broke neighbors, while my gears kept marching, unlistening and too exact. [127]
Precision without regard becomes injury, I learned, a clean blade dragged across a pulse that trusted rhythm. [144]
On my belt hangs a broken rake handle I found on the ridge, rubbed smooth by tides and work. [163]
I carved tiny inscriptions along it, one notch for each conversation mended, each apology offered, incremental absolution against rusted days. [183]
I do not know another way to cleanse except by these small true cuts, never wider than a breath. [202]
The mechanism waits like a wound that understands the needle. [212]
I ease the pendulum with gloved fingers, slowing the bob until the world shivers as if bracing for consequence. [231]
At the crest, there is the slightest stillness, a plank of silence laid across the century, and everything listens. [250]
During that pause I feel the tidal obsidian ridge inside the tower, the black glass heaving through the timbers. [269]
Moonlight veers, gulls tilt, and from the stones emerge drowned monograms, old debts surfacing with the foam. [286]
I see the fisherman I corrected in public for lateness, while his child waited at a clinic upshore. [304]
I see our schoolteacher, whose wedding bells I set perfectly, even though the tide roared warnings of a squall. [323]
Balance is not a line knifed through time, I think, but a woven wake we carry together across the dark. [343]
I act through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle, holding it to the sliver of dawn like charted shoals, instructions for my hands. [368]
Each mark tells which screw to loosen, which worn tooth to shim with reed, which face to visit later bearing bread. [389]
The pause stretches thin as hot wire, but it holds, and I move inside it like a solder's brief spark. [409]
I coax a binding arbor to breathe, oil a pivot with patience, and whisper aloud the names my marks remember. [429]
Incremental absolution hums through the brass, not absolving me alone, but forgiving the distance between neighbors, boats, and horizons. [448]
Below, the ridge hisses like bread cooling, and I know they hear it in the kitchens and the slips. [467]
I have been precise; now I will be ethically diligent, not only about time, but about consequence. [484]
My father wound this clock by guess and feel, and he taught me measurement could be a form of listening. [504]
I forgot the listening when storms took his skiff, and I tightened every screw as if grief were slop in the bearings. [526]
Now I hear his rough song in the bob's slow breath, and I let the silence cue my next kindness. [546]
When the adjustments are set, I wait until the last tick of stillness loosens, and I release the pendulum. [565]
Time returns like surf, each beat washing the ridge, the street, the faces, with a rhythm we can share. [584]
The bells ring not triumph but invitation, and their metal taste on the air feels like a promised truce. [603]
I climb down and cross to the tidal obsidian ridge, where the sea has spat up mirror shards of night. [623]
The fisherman stands there, late again, holding a net like a question, and I step beside him without correction. [642]
I offer him the rake handle, its tiny inscriptions shallow as breaths, and ask him to carve one more line. [662]
We write his child's name, then adjust our launch to the bell's rhythm and the tide's pull, restoring shared balance. [682]
From under the water, the ridge lets a slow knell emerge, a note that answers the tower without surrendering itself. [702]
I taste salt, iron, and relief, and I feel how absolution works, one stroke at a time, never finished. [721]
Back above, the pendulum bob arcs wider by a breath, as if the tower has finally learned to listen. [740]</story>
