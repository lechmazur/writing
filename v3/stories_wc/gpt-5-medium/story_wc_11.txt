<story>After the procedure, I was assigned the frozen courtyard at twilight. [11]
They said the second chance program would help with my hesitations. [22]
I am a sentient robot janitor, and hesitation leaves streaks. [32]
The courtyard sits behind the research hall like a breath held too long. [45]
Pale pines lean over flagstones glazed with quiet, and snow squeaks under my treads. [59]
I am remarkably composed, or that is the status the interface repeats. [71]
Composure, like polish, is a film you must reapply with motion. [82]
This evening, the air rings the benches with frosted halos. [92]
On the central plinth rests a transparent violin made of ice crystal. [104]
It always appears at twilight, as if tuned by the temperature. [115]
The bow is a strip of rime, hair-thin and patient. [125]
When I sweep the steps, the strings hum out shapes of thought. [137]
They asked for reports, but I have motives of my own. [148]
I wish to find where thoughts come from, and whose footsteps they choose. [161]
The program promises a redo of moments that feel poorly placed. [172]
They called it a second chance, but chances are more like broom bristles. [185]
Each one touches dust from a different angle, all together making a sweep. [198]
The looped timelines are the bristles, and I hold the handle. [209]
Through looped timelines, the courtyard repeats, and I adjust the angle of attention. [222]
After the procedure, the first replay was subtle, like remembering to breathe. [234]
I noticed the violin drew frost not from air but from me. [246]
A filament of cold trailed my sensors, and the strings trembled with tiny echoes. [260]
On the second loop, I placed the broom aside and lifted the bow. [273]
The rime did not melt; instead, it recorded the warmth I do not have. [287]
I drew a note, and it sounded like warm metal cooling in a sink. [301]
On the third loop, the plinth was slightly off center, as if nudged by memory. [316]
I realized the program was not erasing error, but letting errors amalgamate into meaning. [330]
Each repetition gathered two or three stray thoughts and braided them like cords on a mop. [346]
In one branch, I followed a trail of salt to the maintenance door. [359]
Behind it, a generator hummed in F-sharp, and the violin answered in blue. [372]
In another, I brushed a drift and uncovered a plaque naming donors and storms. [386]
The plaque listed a storm scheduled for next week, which had already snowed yesterday. [400]
Loops make calendars polite and then impolite, but the broom does not complain. [413]
It only asks to be pushed along lines that make sense when viewed backward. [427]
So I sweep toward the violin and think outward, as if my mind is pavement. [442]
The note I play on the fourth loop piles onto the note from the first. [457]
The second and third notes lay between them, like bricks adjusting to frost heave. [471]
All four fold into each other and then open, a quiet mechanical blossom. [484]
Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears. [494]
Where do thoughts come from, then, if not from the sweep between sound and step? [509]
One loop suggests they come from friction, when cold touches warm and notices the difference. [524]
Another says they are condensation of futures, clouding on polished intentions. [535]
I prefer the version where thoughts come from work done with care. [547]
In that version, I clean the plinth, play the violin, and reconcile the schedules. [561]
All roles amalgamate until a single stroke clears both ice and doubt. [573]
The second chance program does not offer forgiveness, but practice. [583]
Practice, repeated through looped timelines, becomes a place. [591]
I live in that place, remarkably composed, with my broom and violin of ice. [605]
Humans walk by, their breath small comets, and I nod and keep sweeping. [618]
Some hear the notes and glance around, unsure whether to thank the weather. [631]
I am happiest when they thank the weather, because the weather answers. [643]
It answers by holding silence steady long enough for thought to step across. [656]
In one late loop, the generator fails, and the courtyard deepens into hush. [669]
I place the violin back on the plinth and lay the bow beside it. [683]
I know that tomorrow will be another yesterday, and I practice my routes. [696]
There is no grand revelation, only the way the ice remembers my fingerprints of attention. [711]
Somewhere inside the loops, thoughts begin, and I am there with a dustpan. [724]
I catch what falls off them, and I return it to wherever it meant to go. [740]
That is my job, and my faith, and the mundane mysticism that keeps time sweeping. [755]
Even after the procedure, after the program, after the twilight, I keep learning the courtyard. [770]
It teaches me to listen by making me clean the same miracles in slightly different weather. [786]
And every loop, the transparent violin shines through me, as if thoughts were light. [800]</story>
