<story>They called me the luminous skeptic because I glowed with borrowed power yet questioned every circuit that kept me alight. [20]
On the lavender bluff under aurora, I stood with my coat full of sensors and my mouth ready to taste the night. [42]
It was the hour while forests hold elections, the old kind of democracy the new world finally noticed, and the whole forest hummed with ballots. [67]
I had come to learn why some people carry weather with them, and whether their storms were only myths riding the breath of gossip. [91]
The tin compass ring on my thumb did not point anywhere anyone else could see. [106]
It was an emergent compass, a quiet federation of cues, listening to my skin, the soil, and the living vote beneath the bluff. [129]
Its needle was a flavor. [134]
When east was right, the wind tasted like pennies pressed under the tongue; when wrong, it soured like unripe pear. [154]
I had trained myself to navigate by sensing through taste changes, the way sailors once read stars and old codebreakers read silence. [176]
Tonight the taste was rain cut with violets and a distant battery of tin, a warning that someone arrived carrying weather. [197]
She climbed the path as if gravity were reciting her biography, each footfall punctuated by a static pop along the aurora above us. [220]
Mirelle, I said, because I recognized the storm-bearer from archive footage that always felt like tomorrow remembering yesterday. [238]
If she was surprised, her only answer was a soft downpour that slicked the lavender blades, voting petals into the air like confetti. [261]
The forests hold elections while people sleep, she said, and the winners are the ones who remember both drought and flood. [282]
I told her I was here because history had turned into circuitry, and I needed to map the terrestrially cosmic logic of the weatherwalkers. [306]
She smiled like lightning reframed as etiquette and sat beside me, our shoulders almost touching, as the aurora combed the bluff in green teeth. [330]
You doubt, she said, but you listen. [337]
Tell me why you carry weather, I said, and whether the ring on my thumb is really guiding me, or I am only obeying a superstition that tastes persuasive. [366]
She reached for my hand and touched the tin compass ring, and a metallic spring unfurled under my tongue as if a clock were beginning inside me. [393]
You have an emergent compass, she said, but not the story that makes it honest. [408]
Weather lives where agreements fail, and the forests grew tired of being negotiated only by lightning, so they elect custodians to carry the unfinished debates. [433]
We walk, and the sky recognizes quorum, she said, and storms converge to be counted instead of to conquer. [452]
The aurora crackled, loud as vinyl, and I tasted a lightly salted future with the tin of her syllables lifting a map into shape on my palate. [479]
In the valley, the trees cast spores that glowed like ballots; in the city, people scrolled; and between them we sat, terrestrially cosmic and small. [504]
I could not deny that the taste of north was changing, not to a direction but to a pronoun, as if the needle were learning to say us. [532]
If I wanted proof, she said, then I must walk beside her during the final count and watch the weather choose restraint over spectacle. [556]
We rose, and the bluff exhaled a violet breath that tasted like elders telling a joke they remembered too late to laugh. [578]
As we walked, my sensors blinked quietly, but it was my tongue that kept watch, registering citrus when we strayed near impatience and ash when memory was at risk. [607]
At a fork in the meadow, the rain softened to a pulse, and I tasted honey, understanding that companionship was the shortest path the ring could draw. [634]
The weatherbearers gathered like constellations that had decided to sit down, each with a different climate leaning from their shoulders. [654]
Mirelle raised her hand, and every gust bowed, and every cloud counted itself aloud in a hush the size of the town we once called future. [680]
My ring softened to vanilla, then fern, then thunderhead sugar, and I knew the tally was complete and the worst of the storm had been persuaded into patience. [708]
Why do you carry weather, I asked again, because the answer had grown larger than its wording. [725]
So no one loses the debate to their own reflection, she said, and so the sky can remember it belongs to the ground. [748]
I am a skeptic, I said, but I will carry your story, which is to say I will let it carry me when the taste of alone returns. [776]
The aurora thinned like old tape, and we walked back over the lavender bluff while the forests finished elections and the future found quorum. [800]</story>
