<story>After the drawbridge rises, the river loosens its grip, and I step onto the drowned promenade with boots remembering former thresholds. [21]
I am the Firm shore surveyor, Stoically sensitive to every shift of silt, every sigh the pilings release when tide subtracts its weight. [44]
The submerged pavilion lies ahead, a lace of arches veiled by green water, a ballroom for weeds and the rinse of late light. [67]
My tripod coughs against the balustrade, and the echo travels down to carp listening like patient archivists. [84]
I did not come merely to measure. [91]
To become the archeologist of abandoned dreams, I must touch what sank and catalog the way emptiness braids itself through what remains. [113]
The old city did not vanish; it withdrew into Interlaced absence, a pattern only visible if you stand still as silt. [134]
So I unroll my charts, but first I wrest the ironed latch of a service door that rust sealed shut for twenty years. [157]
Inside, the pavilion's underrooms breathe out a damp that smells like letters never sent. [171]
I take from my satchel an antique traveling inkwell, stained with tides of ink older than my meticulous patience. [190]
Its lid snaps like a small lighthouse shutting its eye, and I feel the hush between clicks as a charted current. [211]
A hush that burns, a hushed blaze, because the work asks for heat without spectacle. [226]
My method is unglamorous and exact: Placing notes in foundation repairs where no one expects a voice to be waiting. [246]
Each seam I mend in mortar receives a slip of paper, numbered, witness-bearing, folded to ride the stone's slow heartbeat. [266]
The notes tell what the river will never say aloud: where chairs once scraped, where a musician leaned, where a vow spilled and spread. [290]
Above me, through the wavering ceiling, daylight unthreads into coins, and I map their fall as if mapping vanished laughter. [310]
Some say I am too severe, too obedient to the line, but firmness is how I hold the trembling that arrives with memory. [333]
Stoically Sensitive they called me in school, and I learned to accept the paradox as a compass that rarely lies. [353]
This pavilion, once the city's summer lantern, turned its back on land and offered its face to currents. [371]
When the river rose beyond remedy, officials closed it, chains flowered locks, and lovers learned other piers. [388]
After the drawbridge rises now, a delayed ceremony, the water calms just enough to let me enter by the service mouth. [409]
I thread a line to the first column and count the chipped initials, the graffiti of tides: arrows, dates, a crown of rust. [432]
There I place a note about the musician who might have watched the moon misplace itself in a glass, half in jest, half in dread. [457]
Another slip goes where a stair is missing, and I write only a coordinate and two words: Interlaced absence. [476]
In the deepest room I find a glass cabinet asleep in silt, and inside a water-bitten program from an opening night. [497]
I wrest it from the cabinet with gentleness, because wrestling is not only for rage, it is for custody and for care. [519]
On the back I copy the names into the inkwell's patient mouth, and then into a slip that I tuck behind the jamb. [542]
Hushed Blaze, I write as a heading, to remind myself that restraint is a flame that marks without consuming. [561]
Wind pushes the river like a reluctant broom, and a new sound emerges, a fox barking on the far side of iron. [583]
I close my ledger and feel the bridge's raised spine as a timeline on which I move backward, to a point before the flood. [607]
But history will not lower itself for me; it makes me climb through what is missing and listen to the spaces converse. [629]
So I keep fixing what I can, measuring, mending, and Placing notes in foundation repairs until even silence has a ledger. [650]
When night takes the top of the water, the pavilion brightens strangely, as if memory were bioluminescent, and I stand at the doorway alight. [674]
I do not wait for rescue or recognition; I wait for the moment when what is gone accepts my witness without shame. [696]
Then I pack the antique traveling inkwell, fold my tripod, and mark the waterline on the door for tomorrow's depth. [716]
I leave behind a final slip in the crack where the hinge moans, addressed to anyone who will later lift the floor and find it. [741]
It says, simply, that I was here not to repair the past but to map its living gaps, and to love them until they answer. [766]
On my walk back, I watch the drawbridge sleep like a huge eyelid, and the city breathe through its missing teeth, aligned and merciful. [790]</story>
