<story>After the mysterious package arrives, the sea outside my mortuary stops pretending to be calm. [15]
I am a weary undertaker who measures days by the weight of names, and tonight the names feel waterlogged. [34]
The package contains a broken lighthouse lens nested in kelp and twine, and a paper tag that reads, Return what it refuses to forget. [58]
I hold the glass and feel chased stillness breathing behind me, as if quiet itself wants out of its binding. [78]
The tag is tied to a map scrawled with tide times and a circle around the forgotten underwater city library. [98]
I have long wanted to give rest a permanent address, somewhere the lost can forward themselves without fear of eviction. [118]
So I go, inadvertently stubborn in the way a tide forgets how to reverse, carrying the shattered lens like a heart. [139]
The city sits three streets below the harbor, a skeleton of boulevards sealed in glass domes and regret. [157]
I descend through a service well, occupying impossible spaces between bubbles and beams, until the library doors greet my gloves. [177]
Inside, the water is thin as breath, held back by tired barriers; shelves lean like old divers. [194]
Books float on tethers, their pages cataloging distress signals sent by ships that never made it home. [211]
I know these signals like prayers, three shorts and three longs and three shorts, a staccato shaking of the soul. [231]
I set the broken lighthouse lens on a reading desk, and the room brightens with cautious algae light. [249]
The lens hums with salt memory, scattering glints that hop from title to title until one stays. [266]
Manual for Beacon Keepers, it says, and inside is a diagram to revitalize what lighthouses surrender when they drown. [285]
Maybe, I think, if a lens remembers its task, the dead can stop sending distress from their last addresses. [304]
The shelves tick like cooling engines, and chased stillness prowls the aisles, urging me to hurry or hush. [322]
I follow the manual's instruction to occupy impossible spaces, slipping myself between broken panes of time where water cannot reach. [342]
I angle the shattered lens to the vents where bioluminescent plankton breathe, and their glow bends into a rune of attention. [363]
I arrange mirrors from cracked book covers, then tap code along the rails, a new distress that asks, Where shall we rest. [385]
Voices answer without sound, the catalogs loosening, cards drifting from drawers like gull feathers naming homeports. [401]
Names I once dressed in linen gather around the desk, and I promise them an address that does not change. [421]
The manual warns that a broken lens can miscall storms, but I am inadvertently stubborn, and I refuse to stop aligning shards. [443]
From the vestibule comes a scraping like anchors on bone, and chased stillness takes the shape of a mantled thing. [463]
It tests the dome with a patient forehead, for patience is how the sea kills; it waits and calls it rest. [484]
I realize rest is not surrender but location, so I keep building the message until it points somewhere real. [503]
Home becomes this library, the only place still remembering them, and the signal names shelf numbers like streets. [521]
I assign coordinates from the card catalog, aisle to aisle, alcove to alcove, until every departed has a permanent address. [541]
When I open the lens to the vents, the glow leaps outward, and the city above flickers like a listening ear. [562]
On the pier, lanterns answer the pattern, not as panic but as permission, a civilized hush replacing the old distress signals. [583]
The mantled thing dims, having no quarrel with addresses, and the dome stops its tired groan. [599]
I breathe for the first time like it belongs to me, and the library breathes back with a dry sigh. [619]
I etch my mortuary's stamp into the desk, a forwarding order that reads, Deliver to any soul requiring stillness. [638]
I was never brave, only hired to look unafraid, but grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry. [658]
I keep arranging shards until the lens is more mosaic than mirror, and its fractures spell routes the current honors. [678]
The beacon we release does not command return; it revitalizes staying, knitting a harbor where nothing must depart. [696]
I send one last code, not SOS but SOR, stay or rest, and the water slackens like a vow kept. [716]
When I finally climb the service well, the harbor smells of kelp tea and candles, and the wind uses my name gently. [738]
Behind me the forgotten underwater city library keeps its lights, a patient registry open for arrivals and last words. [757]
If anyone comes asking, tell them the undertaker is not missing; he is at work, giving rest a permanent address. [777]</story>
