<story>The wind combed the mist like cold fingers as I paced the storm-worn windblown parapet in mist. [17]
This was our neutral territory, a spine of stone between flags and vendettas, and I was its prisoner exchange negotiator. [37]
I am uncommonly thoughtful, not as praise but as survival, because here a loose thought can topple more than a loose stone. [59]
Mist made the world a furrowed hush, and every footstep from both stairways sounded like a sentence being considered. [78]
On nights like this, I held a small weight in my pocket, an antique drawer pull polished by worry and purpose. [99]
It came from my grandmother's desk, the one she used when she brokered seed swaps after ration winters, and it steadied my fingers. [122]
I kept it because I am trying to recycle mistakes into wisdom, to turn each bruise into a bridle on tomorrow. [143]
Down one stair, the Voric sentinels emerged with three prisoners, wrists roped and eyes searching for forbidden horizons. [161]
Down the other, the Estaran guard shepherded two captains and a healer, faces carved thin by waiting. [178]
They had agreed to meet only by synchronizing through moon phases, because both calendars lied and only the sky could be trusted. [200]
Tonight's first-quarter moon hung above the mist like a clipped coin, the signal we had promised after three clouded postponements. [220]
I raised my hand, palm out, and both processions halted at the parapet's teeth with the obedience of exhausted dogs. [240]
Between apology and forgiveness there is a narrow weather where I work, a current you can miss if you blink. [260]
I set a ledger on a wet stone and placed the drawer pull atop it, bright as a coin from the shared past both sides pretended to forget. [288]
Listen, I said, because that is my first trade, and the wind pressed the mist closer until we had only each other to consider. [312]
No horns, no banners, no names that are only insults in disguise. [324]
We are here to untether people from mistakes we made, and to tie something gentler in place. [341]
The Voric commander, Raglen, gnawed a scar at his lip and nodded, which for him was an hour of speech. [361]
The Estaran captain, Della, tightened her grip on the healer's elbow and said that a boy would not survive another night. [382]
Names of hunger moved quicker than names of sovereignty; that was wisdom, recycled from our last disaster. [399]
We exchanged our lists under the moon's thin coin and I felt the drawer pull warm my palm until I imagined it a pulse. [423]
The first trade was the healer for the youngest Voric, a farmer conscript whose laugh had cracked when they cut his hair too close. [447]
Della unknotted the healer's wrists and stepped back, and I crossed the wet flags to untether the boy from his rope. [468]
He flinched when I reached him, and I showed him the drawer pull, telling him it had opened a desk where treaties were once kept. [493]
If we can open old things, I said, we might find the paper we forgot to sign. [510]
He tried a smile, which felt like dawn behind clouds, and he walked where I pointed, steps careful on the slick teeth of stone. [534]
Raglen grunted approval, then lifted the healer with surprising tenderness, as if he remembered being a son. [551]
The second trade snagged on a name, an old raid misremembered by one messenger and misused by another, and tempers climbed the steps. [574]
I heard the shift, the way soldiers hold their breath to make thoughts sharper, and the parapet felt narrower by inches. [595]
This is not where we argue the past, I said, this is where we harvest it, because that is what neutral territory grows. [618]
I put the drawer pull between my thumb and forefinger, and held it up so both sides saw the tarnish that their weather had made. [643]
This belonged to the desk in the school that burned when Estaran maps met Voric fire, and the brass remembers both names. [665]
If the metal can hold two stories without breaking, perhaps we can hold a moment, between apology and forgiveness, without breaking either. [687]
Silence moved across the stones in a furrowed hush, and I saw shoulders drop as if armor exhaled through skin. [707]
We finished the exchanges by the rules we had written while synchronizing through moon phases, and the coins of our breath steadied. [729]
Raglen untethered the last Estaran captain himself, blade tucked, and offered a nod that could be taught to hard sons everywhere. [750]
Della sent two sacks of grain with the farmer conscript, because the healer had told her the Voric stores were waterlogged. [771]
When they left, the parapet widened again, and the mist thinned, and I stood with the drawer pull until the metal cooled. [793]</story>
