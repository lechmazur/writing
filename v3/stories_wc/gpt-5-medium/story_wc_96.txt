<story>I am the vagrant penny poet the city keeps stepping over and then looking back at, startled by rhyme. [19]
This body molts personalities monthly, shedding faces like ticket stubs, and somewhere new my voice cracks and brightens. [37]
Tonight my latest skin smells of rain and iron, and my pockets chime with copper syllables waiting for homes. [56]
I walk to the rusted library under stars, where the stacks are ribs, and books breathe like sleeping beasts. [75]
We kept it alive with busted tarps and outlaw glue, stitched spines with fishing line, fed it with found pages. [95]
Lio meets me there as the moon clears the skyline, his breath ghosting, his laugh carrying the clink of keys. [115]
We met years back, sorting books at a prison library, alphabetizing hope while guards dozed and dust rehearsed revolutions. [134]
A friendship sparked there, between returns and requests, where he slid me a dogeared Neruda like a lit match. [153]
We have been striking pages against darkness ever since, learning which words catch, which ones flare and hold. [171]
He carries diagrams of radio guts; I carry pennies engraved with verbs, a small currency burning holes in nothing. [190]
Between us clatters a dented coffee tin with a secret false bottom, rattling like a cautious heart. [207]
Inside the top are coins and clippings and a crumpled city notice threatening demolition; beneath hides our map of sparks. [227]
The plan is not a plan so much as a blooming resistance, vines of action threaded through alleys and lungs. [247]
We will rebuild the library without asking, rivet night to morning, call stray hands from bus stops and kitchens and stoops. [268]
Our motive is stupid and holy: to forge beauty from anarchy before my next molting makes me a stranger to my own fire. [291]
Lio sets a battery on a shelf and hums to it, like coaxing a starling off a wire. [309]
I sort a pile into secret geographies: recipes with manifestos, court transcripts with lullabies, weather reports with exile and return. [329]
The city would call it disorder; we call it an index of need, the luminous fracture of a pattern healing by surprise. [351]
Out back, the fence is a harp missing strings, but the wind plays it anyway, singing in ragged octaves. [370]
As the moon climbs higher, I empty my pockets and spill pennies inked with phrases we can spend on hesitating strangers. [391]
Take courage, one reads, and another says, Read aloud, and a third whispers, We have room for you on these shelves. [412]
People come like rumors turning truthful, a woman with a stroller, two teens with marker on their knuckles, an old cook. [433]
We hand them pages, and they hand us stories, and the stacks stop feeling like bones and start feeling like ribs again. [455]
Lio wires a lantern to the battery and the aisles gather light, a hush that is not silence but agreement. [475]
I click the false bottom open and reveal the map, not paper but a chain of addresses written on flattened pennies. [496]
Each copper disc marks a house where a book was seized or a song fined, and we draw lines between them. [517]
The pattern shows a neighborhood like a throat clearing, and Lio says, Tonight we teach the wind to carry syllables farther. [538]
We string twine between shelves and fence, clip poems to it with clothespins, and the lines lift like prayer flags. [558]
Every time a bus exhales at the corner, the poems flutter and a stranger stops, catches a word, and holds it. [579]
I watch my current personality glow and crack, and I press my palm to my chest to keep the fragments friendly. [600]
If I molt tomorrow, let the next self remember this night by the ghost of copper on the fingers. [619]
Let it find the coffee tin dented and waiting, let it know where the bottom opens and which map to trust. [640]
A siren grazes the edge of our camp, but no one flinches; the lantern holds, the breath of the place steadies. [661]
I step onto a milk crate and read the pennies aloud like rosary, a soft economy spending itself into warmth. [681]
Lio translates into motion, passing boards, raising brackets, guiding hands until the shelves stand straight and the pages stop shivering. [701]
We rebuild the door from a refrigerator panel and a belt, and the click it makes is almost a promise. [721]
When the moon finally drops, not defeated but done, the skyline has teeth marks, and the wind smells like graphite. [741]
We leave the map where others can find it, and the coffee tin clinks closed with a sound like a page turning. [763]
Beauty is not a treaty here, Lio says, but a practice, and I answer, Then let us practice until dawn. [783]
The blooming resistance breathes, broken and bright, as morning lifts a blue lid. [796]</story>
