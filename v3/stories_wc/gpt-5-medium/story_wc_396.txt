<story>The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes shivered as I climbed the basalt steps with the shard. [18]
I was the shadow-laced peacekeeper they had summoned, my coat smelling of brine and smoke and unslept prayers. [36]
They wanted a verdict; I wanted to map empathy onto action. [47]
Above us, trees bowed under fruit that held small moons, and below us the floes bit at each other like tired wolves. [69]
The orchard keepers and the ice fishers had traded accusations until their throats rasped, each swearing the other had stolen light. [90]
I carried the broken crystal ball fragment in a silk wrap, the last relic of a seer whose counsel once bridged winters. [112]
If the ball were whole, it would show the common wound; now it showed only the absences, hard and sharp as doubt. [134]
So I went to town, to the vintage store that collects yesterday's reflections like trapped birds. [150]
The owner placed mirrors along the wall like a quiet choir, and I held the shard before them, not to divine, but to remember. [174]
We began to reconstitute via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, the fragment catching lost angles from glass that had watched a hundred unspoken bargains. [198]
Each reflection lent a ghostly curvature, and in the overlap a fuller sphere trembled, assembled not by glue but by consent. [219]
I am calmly intuitive, my teachers used to say ruefully, as if patience were a stubborn weed that choked urgency. [239]
Here, patience made a method; the mirrors hummed with other afternoons, and the shard confessed to where it had belonged. [259]
I recorded the pattern of seams as one might record constellations, then wrapped the fragment again and climbed back to the orchard. [281]
Word had spread that I trafficked with reflections, which the keepers feared and the fishers mistrusted in equal ratios. [300]
I did not bring them certainty; I brought them a rehearsal for it. [313]
We gathered beneath trees strung with lanterns shaped like pears, the ice groaning below like a thing trying to sleep. [333]
I set the broken crystal ball fragment on a crate and told them what the mirrors had agreed to show. [353]
In those echoes, the whole ball revealed not futures but the underside of choices, thin as onion skin and just as layered. [375]
Every quarrel traced back to a winter when a child fell through a crack and both sides blamed the other's delay. [396]
The mirrors gave me that night as if I had stood there, hearing the calls thrown across black water like ropes that never reached. [420]
So I proposed a map for making amends that could be walked, lifted, and built, not simply spoken. [438]
We would plant beacon saplings along the floe lanes and rig them with heatless light, to mark safe crossings without melting the paths. [461]
We would time watch shifts with the tides, pairing a keeper with a fisher, twins of duty, so no cry would cross into emptiness. [485]
And we would name the child in their records not a loss but the courageous anomaly who insists that rules bend toward care. [508]
A murmur lifted like startled birds, then scattered into arguments, and I waited through the rise and fall without offering rescue. [529]
The orchard keeper Matilde asked whose fault would feed the ledger if ice took another small set of hands. [548]
The fisher Harun demanded to know who would watch the watchers, and what the fragment had to do with their waiting. [569]
I lifted the silk and held the shard so it caught the lantern pears and flung them across faces that had only seen themselves by fire. [595]
Between my words and their answer, during the weighted breath before reply, I felt the reconstituted sphere hover again around us, clear and complete. [619]
Not a prophecy, but a room where each could stand and see the other without the ice rushing their ankles. [639]
I told them the reckoning would be a wheel of tasks, not a pit; that guilt would be compost, not a flag. [661]
Matilde wiped brine from her sleeve, Harun studied the ground, and somewhere a floe split with a sound like a page turning. [683]
They nodded, not together and not apart, the smallest synchronized movement our town had managed in years. [700]
I breathed, let the shard fall back into silk, and felt the shadows lace me tighter, a mantle earned by patience. [721]
I would live here a season to keep the watches and learn their names, because a verdict is nothing without the walking that follows it. [746]
In the nights, when the lantern pears dimmed and the ice carried songs from far lifts, the mirrors of the vintage store still spoke in me. [772]
They reminded me that a courageous anomaly is only courageous until it becomes practice, and practice, finally, is how peace keeps. [793]</story>
