<story>I reached the terra-cotta grotto under starlight after the energy beings arrive, though the highway still hummed somewhere like a stubborn memory. [22]
I am a drifting roadside poet, and I had followed the glowing mile markers like they were rhymes that refused to end. [44]
It was unmistakably after the energy beings arrive, because the air trembled with their violet arithmetic. [60]
They had draped quiet over the town like a silk shawl, and under that hush I could hear the grotto breathing. [81]
I had brought a frayed coil of rope from a prison escape, not for bravado but as a reminder that walls can teach you the size of sky. [109]
The rope smelled of rust and rain, and it braided the night with a history I could not stop touching. [129]
I came with a motive and a mischief, ethically playful in every choice I made along the road. [147]
My motive was to discover the texture of time, and my mischief was to do it without breaking anything that could feel. [169]
The grotto promised both, for its walls showed centuries of water and fingertips, and its floor held the chill of last storms. [191]
I lit a small lantern, then darkened it again, because the starlight knew better how to speak here. [209]
My notes began as whispers, lines that patterned the dust the way water patterns cliffs. [224]
I set the frayed coil in a gentle spiral on the ground, and I tried to pattern my breathing to the grotto's slow pulse. [248]
By uncovering layers, I told myself, I might hear the secret the planet keeps under polite daylight. [265]
An energy being drifted at the mouth of the cave, filaments like ivy, a hint of lightning tamed by patience. [285]
It did not speak, yet meaning pooled between us with passionate subtlety, and I knew it too listened for time's grain. [306]
I told it I was a poet who lived between exits, that I wrote by collecting the small refusals of commonplace hours. [328]
It answered with a ripple that tasted like metal on my tongue, and a memory not mine slid under my skin. [349]
I saw a prison made of clocks, corridors where seconds were cells, and the only door was an impossible choice with two handles. [372]
One handle released you into a perfect past that would dissolve you, and the other released you into a future that would not notice. [396]
The ripple withdrew, leaving me kneeling with my rope, and I understood why I had carried it across deserts and sirens. [417]
The rope was a form of listening, a way to hold the edge of a choice without falling into symbolism. [437]
I looped it around a stalagmite, then around my waist, and asked the being to show me how time bruises. [457]
It unfurled a light that did not blind, and together we patterned footprints through the dust like a loom might weave a childhood. [480]
Each print lifted a tale, and each tale revealed another beneath it, as if the floor were a palimpsest of seasons. [501]
I learned quickly and slowly, that to know the texture of time is to notice the pattern of our alibis, the serial excuses we call progress. [527]
I felt the tug of the rope around my waist, not as danger but as grammar, a reminder that connection is a sentence you must finish. [553]
The being showed me a canyon where the river had made impossible choices at every bend, and still arrived laughing at the delta. [576]
It let me taste silt that had been mountain, then lake, then field, then throat, and I realized the ethics of change are playful or cruel depending on who is asked. [607]
So I spoke my vow aloud, in a voice modest as a match: I would be ethically playful, keep mercy quick, and hold my metaphors accountable. [633]
The being nodded with its whole body, which was the night itself agreeing to be written without being owned. [652]
Then it showed me the last layer, the one I had feared, where my own past unspooled like my rope and revealed the knots I tied to seem heroic. [681]
In that chamber, choice was not a door but a mirror that let me breathe only if I forgave the version of me that ran first and helped later. [710]
I pressed the rope against the glass of the mirror that was not glass, and felt its old fibers take on the warmth of consent. [735]
I would not cut away my past to climb out; I would braid it into present strength, and the grotto seemed to approve. [758]
When I left, the road received me like an old colleague, the mile markers now small constellations I could pattern into letters whenever I felt lost. [784]</story>
