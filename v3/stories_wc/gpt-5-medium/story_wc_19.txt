<story>I am a bunker builder's claustrophobic child, and walls make my pulse burr like a trapped moth. [17]
What I want is to collect the flavors of different silences, to taste how quiet changes shape when places and people forget themselves. [40]
Once every month, when gravity inverts for an hour, streets grow roofs and ladders sprout from drains, and the city turns its underside to the sky. [66]
That is when I climb to the xenial trellis above the clouds, a place built to welcome anyone who can stomach the climb and the unmooring. [92]
The trellis is a lattice of rooms with no corners, gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen, and each alcove keeps a different tasting of quiet. [119]
I bring a tiny porcelain doll my mother left me, cracked at the shoulder and hollow enough to store a breath, because it listens better than I do. [147]
In the bunkers he pours into the earth, my father says silence is safety, measurable, concrete, the kind you can put behind blast doors. [171]
But safety there tastes like stale bread, and I am greedy for something intangibly tangible, something that meets the tongue without hardening the room. [195]
The trellis is xenial in the old way, offering tea cups woven of cloudgrass and seating that adjusts to your fears without asking their names. [220]
Up there, every minute stretches and contracts, stretching contracted like a lung exercising itself, and I can feel my breath learn wider rooms. [243]
When the hour begins to tilt, bells loosen from steeples and float past like dandelion seeds, and the rungs of the trellis bloom new paths. [268]
I cradle the doll and wander from alcove to alcove, gathering quiet with my tongue and with the doll's porcelain cavity, tasting for the one my father could understand. [297]
There is the silence after laughter, which tastes of citrus and an ache; there is the silence inside a book, which tastes like binder's glue and patience. [324]
There is the silence that follows an apology received, which tastes like rain struck copper, and another that hovers before a kiss, which tastes of mint left in pockets. [353]
But the silence I climb for is rarer, a gilded hush that arrives when the sun skims the ocean of clouds and trades light for warmth. [379]
It tastes like honey strained through linen, gold without weight, the afterglow of a choir dismissed and the sense that your bones have been dusted with pollen. [406]
I catch it by limiting exposure, letting only a thread of that quiet touch my tongue while the rest curls into the doll, safe from evaporation. [432]
Too much gilded hush and I stop wanting doors at all, and that scares me in a way the earth never did, because I am made of exits. [460]
As the hour thins, I tie the doll under my shirt where it thumps like a second heart, and I collect another sample, the hush of descending bells. [488]
Then the trellis teaches me its last courtesy, a landing that keeps widening until my knees believe they can meet the ground gracefully. [511]
Gravity remembers itself, and the city shivers back into place, and I ride a loosened ribbon of air down to the alley behind my father's shop. [537]
He is at his bench gluing blueprints to plywood, coaxing corridors to exist, when I ask if he will taste something for me. [560]
I open the doll like a locket and release a curl of gilded hush into the room, careful again by limiting exposure, careful for both our sakes. [587]
The quiet sprout that rises is not absence but shape, a tender shoot of stillness that brushes his lip and then mine, like an answer you do not need to say. [618]
He closes his eyes and leans on the bench, and all the blueprints seem to soften, the corridors bending into arches as if ceilings could learn the patience of clouds. [648]
This, he says, tastes safe, but not like a door locking; safe like stepping into a room you have never left, and I know the word he means is home. [678]
I smile because the word for what I sought has finally found a path through him, not as concrete but as a mapped hush, and it fits his hands. [707]
He gestures to the plans and asks me to help redraw the entrances, to widen them like the trellis did, so that fear cannot corner the ones who enter. [736]
Together we work while the doll cools in my pocket, a small heart learning new beats, and the city around us exhales a silence that tastes of beginnings. [764]
Later I will climb again when the world tips, and the trellis will welcome me like a friend, but tonight I am content to sprout openings here. [791]</story>
