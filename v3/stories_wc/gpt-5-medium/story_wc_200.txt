<story>In the hush of a hidden sunrise, I arrived at echo gorge carrying only a satchel and my modestly fearless breath. [21]
They call me a lost soul collector, but I prefer to think of myself as a gardener of untended laughter. [41]
The gorge is a place where voices live after bodies forget them, and I had come to coax them home. [61]
My method would be unusual even among my quiet trade, because I had learned to listen through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp. [85]
The harp was strung across a cleft in the limestone like a spider web of gut and wire, tuned by the wind's impatience. [108]
When the dawn breathes, the whole gorge quivers, and the instrument confesses what the living never dared to frame. [127]
I had not come for grief alone; my purpose was to integrate laughter into healing, to thread bright echoes into mending. [148]
Laughter, after all, is a bridge the dead can still cross without remembering how heavy their feet had become. [167]
Around my neck hung a crocodile's tooth, yellowed and patient, a relic from a river that had once tried to eat me. [189]
I kept it not as a threat, but as proof that survival can turn its bite into a promise. [208]
When I plucked the first broken chord, the gorge answered with spectral confessions, trembling like light on oil. [226]
Voices spilled from the rock: a carpenter's apology, a child's hiding giggle, a bride's private vow to run toward the storm. [247]
I listened, modestly fearless, because fear is a better teacher when it is asked to speak softly. [264]
The confessions would wander if I judged them, so I held my palms open and my voice low, humming a counter-melody. [285]
A wisp of breath resolved into an old joke about the moon misplacing her spectacles, and I laughed until the sound grew legs. [308]
It ran along the canyon lip, and other voices followed, tripping over themselves like children toward a bright creek. [327]
This is what I pursue: not sorrow's collapse, but its yielding smile when it remembers the game it loved as a seed. [349]
The harp thrummed again, a tuning fork wet with morning, and a new voice approached, hesitant as a deer at a threshold. [371]
She said she had died mid-laughter, choking on a joke only she understood, and now feared laughter would betray her again. [392]
I told her the secret: laughter is a key that unlocks the room you thought was a trap. [410]
We tested the door patiently, each of us bearing the luminous ache of memory like a lantern we refused to set down. [432]
I plucked a string out of line, and the misaligned harp produced a crooked chuckle that made the cliffs grin. [452]
Across the rim, a stone shifted, and the sun scattered coins of heat that pretended they were just another cloud. [472]
In that thin brightness, the woman's voice learned her own edges, and she began telling jokes to herself first, then to me. [494]
When I laughed, I did not hide the crack in my sound, and she understood she was not the only broken instrument. [516]
The gorge held its breath the way a choir does before a risky harmony, and then the rocks burst into applause. [537]
I pressed the crocodile's tooth to the nearest wall and felt the ancient reptile's humor shiver through the stone. [556]
That is when the river under the rock woke and began telling its own story in a tongue of bubbles and soft collisions. [579]
The river remembered a boy who had fallen, and how a crocodile had nudged him to the shore, grinning like a midwife. [601]
I realized the tooth had always been a compass pointing toward mercy, and I let it rest, warm and ordinary, against my sternum. [624]
The woman's laughter braided with the river's recollection, and together they climbed the harp's crooked ladder toward a clearing I could not enter. [647]
I stood aside, as my work requires, watching the air brighten where she passed, the light wearing her name until it could let her go. [672]
Only then did the gorge release a long-held sigh, and the harp settled, satisfied with its benediction of bent music. [692]
I gathered my satchel, but left behind a single string for the wind, so strangers might someday hear the way forward. [713]
My feet turned toward the next valley, where rumors said the stones had gone quiet and would need teasing to remember their mischief. [736]
I will pursue that hush as I pursued this one, trusting my modestly fearless breath to keep time with the untangling world. [758]
Somewhere ahead, another laugh waits aching to belong, and I am ready to carry it, like water in cupped hands, until it spills home. [782]</story>
