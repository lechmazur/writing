<story>The quiet canyon under stars sounded like a breath held too long, then released. [14]
I stood within it, a luminous glass artist who had outlived my own molten mistakes. [29]
The night pressed close, and the cliffs answered each thought with drifting resonance I almost recognized. [45]
After surviving the attempt, I returned to retrace the line that had scorched my work. [60]
Someone had tried to turn my furnace into a tomb, and failed, and vanished. [74]
What remained was a charcoal smuggler's ledger strip, charred along one edge like a black sun. [90]
I found it waterlogged in the ash pit, letters bleeding, numbers stubborn as grit. [104]
It was a scorched testament, not only to trade, but to heat, time, and will. [119]
I slipped it into waxed cloth and carried it here, because the canyon listens. [133]
My teacher used to say glass hears better than it sees, if you kneel to it. [149]
I knelt, and the sand chilled my bones, and the stars felt like witnesses. [163]
I had come to discover purpose in the pauses, the silences between hammer and breath. [178]
The ledger strip waited, flaking its own moons onto my lap, a tiny drought of soot. [194]
I am steadily adaptive, I told the cliffs, because you never stop changing either. [208]
Wind thickened, then thinned, and the canyon carried the rhythm like a kiln carries color. [223]
Dawn would sew itself soon, and with it the method I trusted most. [236]
I read clues in patterns in morning frost, where cold writes what fire cannot confess. [251]
Before the light turned blue, I pressed the strip flat and held my breath. [265]
There were names, of course, but they were less important than the intervals between them. [280]
The gaps spelled routes, pauses shaped into paths, absence turned into guidance. [292]
I laid the strip upon a stone whose surface gleamed like cooled crown glass. [306]
When the frost bloomed from the shadow, its filigree matched the ledger's toothless edges. [320]
I retraced the frost's veins with a glass rod, and the rod sang low. [334]
Song nested in stone, then rose, then braided with the hush of the stars. [348]
In that braid I heard the furnace door slam, the panicked buckling of metal, my heartbeat. [364]
And then another sound, a careless jingle, a laugh that had followed me since apprenticeship. [379]
My teacher's rival, the one who smuggled charcoal to undercut our wood, always laughed that way. [395]
He would have burned me with my own art, and called it thrift, called it necessity. [411]
The ledger strip held his pen marks, the same narrow angles he taught his apprentices. [426]
But its scorched testament also held a map of debt, a chain sure to choke him. [442]
I followed the frost north along the stone, and constellations echoed the crooked entries. [456]
They pointed to the quarry rim, where old sand sleeps under a skin of mica. [471]
There the wind first struck me the night of the attempt, pushing flame toward my hair. [487]
I felt that push again, not as fear, but as instruction, as a nudge toward correction. [503]
Purpose lived in pauses because pauses were doors, and doors could be shut behind you. [518]
I rose, gathered the strip, and spoke to the canyon the way glass speaks to light. [534]
If I returned this ledger to the guild, the rival would claim I forged it. [549]
If I destroyed it, the truth would remain unfixed, like a drop never spun into thread. [565]
So I chose a midpoint, a steadily adaptive answer, neither cold nor hot, but annealed. [580]
I would fuse the ledger within a sheet, a window only the dawn could read. [595]
Then carry it back here, to let frost translate it for any watcher with patience. [610]
I would ask the guild to meet at night, and let the canyon testify. [624]
Not a courtroom, but a kiln of listening, where heat and hush become one witness. [639]
The rival would hear his laugh unspool from stone, braided with the ledger's smoke. [653]
He would see patterns in morning frost reveal the debts he thought invisible, crystalline and public. [669]
And I would stand quiet, as glass stands, letting purpose pour through the emptiness I shaped. [685]</story>
