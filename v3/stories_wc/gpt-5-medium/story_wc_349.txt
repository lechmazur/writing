<story>I opened the shutters of my small shop in the glass orchard library floating upon a swirling sea of clouds. [20]
It was during the lull on a store's very first opening day, the air holding its breath like a courteous usher. [41]
I am a clean slate vendor, which means I sell beginnings shaped like blanks, and blanks shaped like forgiveness. [60]
My wares sat mindfully scattered across the counter, as if they had practiced the art of silence and then taken a vow to demonstrate it. [85]
Between the glass trunks that shelved volumes as fruit, the clouds churned softly below, patient with everyone but thunder. [104]
I had come here not merely to sell, but to find the place where stories begin. [120]
The rumor was that the orchard library kept its seeds in a vault of hush, and that one could enter only by quantifying absence. [144]
I set a placard that read back after the first sentence and listened to the floorboards creak like timid prologues. [164]
No one yet knocked; the lull stretched, a narrow bridge of hour between clouds. [178]
I uncorked the bottled moonlight I keep for proofreading and mercy, and let a teaspoon of it glaze the counter. [198]
Moonlight shows what words intend when they forget to pretend, which is useful when your shelves are stocked with opportunities to start over. [221]
The glaze brightened a printed map etched into the countertop, a filigree of paths threading the aisles like veins in a palm. [243]
It was a map I had been incising for weeks, each line a decision where to place a promise. [262]
To incise is to cut light from shadow until a route declares itself, and I was learning to do it without a blade. [285]
The method was simple to describe and difficult to endure: count the spaces, weigh the pauses, divide by hush, solve for entry, by quantifying absence. [310]
I followed the palest corridor under trellised skylight, past shelves of panes on which letters slept, past trees of glass that bore indexes like leaves. [335]
Every step was a fragment, but each fragment knew its neighbors, and the floor accepted us as a sentence accepts well-placed commas. [357]
I found a door of unlettered vellum that looked like fog had tried to learn manners. [373]
On it hung a shingle in small italic glass: glimmering parole. [384]
I understood then that beginnings apply for release the way prisoners do, and that someone must hear their petitions. [403]
The clean slate vendor is the clerk of that court, I thought, and the sea of clouds is the waiting room. [424]
Inside, the chamber was wide and empty as a withheld breath. [435]
A single glass apple lay on a plinth, its skin opaque with untoldness, its stem a pin of night. [454]
I set the bottled moonlight beside it, and the apple trembled as though listening for an edit. [471]
There were no words to read, so I read the nowhere; there were no signs to follow, so I weighed the hesitations. [493]
Numbers became my rosary: the beats between drips of moonlight, the inches of dust on the plinth, the count of breaths I refused to spend. [518]
The sums bled into a contour, an outline of a hinge etched in the empty air around the apple. [537]
I lifted the moonlight, poured a ribbon of it along the line, and felt the hinge warm like a thought deciding to become speech. [561]
The air swung open. [565]
Behind not-there, the place appeared: a cradle of blank pages that rustled like wind through unmapped countries. [582]
The beginnings were shy, yet eager, and their glimmering parole depended on a signature no ink could provide. [600]
I offered what I had: my ledger of returned regrets, the eraser-dust of customers who had chosen a second chance, and the quiver of my own unfinishedness. [627]
The pages accepted with a hush like rain deciding to be snow. [639]
They folded around the glass apple, and when they opened, the apple contained a seed the size of a comma. [659]
Not ripe to read, not ready to say, but so heavy with maybe that the plinth sighed. [676]
I cupped the comma-seed and felt its meaning test my palm, like a bird judging weather beyond the nest. [695]
It would sprout only in a store during the lull on a store's very first opening day, the contract specified by absence and fulfilled by attention. [721]
So I left the chamber with the seed and the bottled moonlight, and the vellum door closed itself like a polite eyelid. [743]
The aisles welcomed me back with their gleam of patient fruit, as if I had borrowed a season and returned it. [764]
I reached the counter before anyone knocked, and the sign still promised after the first sentence, which now lay sleeping in my hands. [787]</story>
