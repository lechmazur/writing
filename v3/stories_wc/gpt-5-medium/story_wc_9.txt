<story>After the birth, I climbed to the midnight glade above clouds, carrying cards, a saucer, and guilt. [17]
The moon lay like a pale throat, and the air had a choking beauty I welcomed. [33]
I am an onyx-ink cartomancer, willingly perplexed by patterns that refuse to be solved too soon. [49]
Some puzzles should stand upright like stones in wind, else their meaning blows away. [63]
Tonight I sought to find where lost time accumulates, the slurry of minutes we misplace and mourn. [80]
It began with the dolls' tea set saucer crack, a hairline prophecy across porcelain. [94]
My daughter set the saucer beneath a sugar cube, and the fracture bloomed like a map. [110]
After the birth, time ran like milk down the clockface, always spilling before I could catch it. [127]
I traced the crack onto my cards with onyx ink, letting its crooked river replace the old spreads. [145]
The cards demanded pilgrimage, a cloudbound repentance none of my teachers had dared attempt. [159]
So I unfastened the crib mobile, pocketed its ringing moons, and set out for the mountain. [175]
Clouds closed like curtains, but the path knew my soles from the years before motherhood. [190]
The glade above the clouds was a raft of frost-petaled grasses and lantern insects. [204]
They swung their abdomen lamps like pendulums, marking the seconds I meant to beg back. [219]
I laid the cards into the saucer's traced channel, each card a shard of the crack's intention. [236]
The first showed a handprint, stitched with years like seams, and I understood the method required of me. [254]
My family kept a custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths, inked circles growing like tree rings. [271]
We pressed years into fabric to measure love, and maybe, secretly, to pin down time. [286]
Here, above the world, I unrolled that linen archive, fireflies catching letters like sparks. [300]
There was my newborn's tiny starfish, and beside it my trembling palm, as if the cloth kept pulsing. [318]
I laid the saucer over our outlines, rotated until the crack matched my lifeline, and listened. [334]
The glade exhaled, and the wind stacked the clouds into staircases leading down into the moonlit undersea. [351]
Every step downward sounded like an unsaid apology, and my throat closed again around that peculiar beauty. [368]
At the bottom, I found a chamber of stalled seconds, tick-motes suspended like dust within a bell jar. [386]
They clung to threads of unspoken promises, to the lullabies I stopped halfway, to the door I closed softly. [405]
Time accumulates in the unused halves of gestures, the hand not taken, the sentence left unbuttoned. [421]
I could not seize it, only atone, and I was ready to be willingly perplexed forever. [437]
I began the rite the cards suggested: place a card on each stalled second, and name the missing action. [456]
The mobile moons chimed from my pocket as I worked, a lullaby completed at last. [471]
For the night my daughter coughed and I only listened, I pressed my palm into the cloth and spoke water. [491]
For the day I chose work over walking her along the river, I left my footprints in dew. [509]
For the moment I braided my own hair and forgot to braid hers, I offered the comb to the wind. [529]
Each confession shivered the suspended seconds loose, and they drifted upward toward the glade like freed seeds. [546]
The chamber brightened until I stood inside a clock with no face, only openings where hours breathed. [563]
I climbed back, cards empty, saucer warm, and the clouds dazzling like scales on a sleeping leviathan. [580]
There, I spread the birthday tablecloth and traced our hands again, new lines crossing the old ones. [597]
The insects dimmed, as if politely, while I whispered gratitude into the crack that had warned me. [614]
I did not ask the cards when I would fail again, only where to kneel when the next minute frays. [634]
And when dawn lifted the glade toward the waking world, I carried my cloudbound repentance home like milk. [652]
I would unfasten every future knot with both hands, even if the world kept tying more. [668]</story>
