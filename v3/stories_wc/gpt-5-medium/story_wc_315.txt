<story>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds swayed like a breathing cathedral, its platforms stitched to the trunks with braided light. [20]
Rope veins ran along the boughs, and lanterns glowed low to keep the stars from feeling shy. [37]
The midnight pattern seeker crouched at the rail, listening not with ears but with the careful patience of an instrument. [57]
Even the wind carried a soundless echo, a hush that made each knot in the rigging feel articulate. [75]
I was posted here as a watcher, and the watcher's burden is to notice before anyone else can fear. [94]
Our leader trusted me to preserve trust under pressure, a delicate circle that could snap if I blinked. [112]
Tonight, after the radio static clears, the supply wing will thread the cloud seam and dock at our highest cradle. [132]
I test my parachute buckle with a thumb, hear the faint click through the glove, and breathe the ritual again. [152]
Remembering through muscle memory is not memory at all, but a handshake between the body and a task waiting in the dark. [174]
I have always been attentively inventive, finding where patterns kink and smoothing them before they snare ankles. [191]
Out beyond the orchard of towers, the clouds whirlpool strangely, like a lens focusing heat rather than light. [209]
I have seen that before where gullies once hid cavalry, and I learned to revise routes when the ground pretended to be sky. [232]
The radio hisses, then a voice threads through like a needle working a wound, saying we are two minutes ahead. [252]
When the static clears entirely, I mark the new course by tapping the rail in a code the crew has learned by feel. [275]
They do not need to hear me, because our hands remember, and remembering through muscle memory means nothing gets lost to panic. [297]
Still, the watcher's burden tugs, asking whether I have seen enough to trust my own invention. [313]
The arbor creaks in long vowels, trees that outgrew the ground and decided to keep going until pressure forgot them. [333]
I remember the one night I failed to read the seam, and the glider burst its rail like a startled horse. [354]
We caught the pilot by a wrist, and the scar he keeps is a line under our friendship that neither of us crosses. [377]
Now that pilot is the approaching voice, and my chest tightens at the thought of asking him to trust me again. [398]
He knows my patterns, the way I double-check, the way I pause and seem to listen for roots entering frost. [418]
I clip the parachute buckle into the guide ring that swings near the edge and feed a rope through the hungry slot. [440]
It will take the shock, then let go exactly when a body must fall in a curve rather than a drop. [461]
Below me the crew makes their small bargains with fear, checking knots, tapping rails, sharing small jokes that break like soap bubbles. [483]
I set the lanterns to green-blue, the fog color that means revise your approach, and I send the tapping message again. [504]
The wing appears as a suggestion first, then as a stitched moth, then as the ship we know, trailing cloud as if stitched to it. [529]
His voice breaks in, calm but clipped, and he says the old route feels wrong, requesting my eyes without the pride he once wore. [553]
I tell him the seam is squeezed, the clouds heating like a fist, and that he must tilt early and ride the colder ribbon. [577]
I do not add my apology, because apologies blow away up here, and because the watcher's burden is to spare words until landing. [600]
The wing slides sideways, catching the blue-green clue, and its belly lamplight flickers across the bark like pondwater. [618]
I scan the vortex and feel my knees echo their shape, a diagram learned by falling and almost falling. [637]
When the ship leans, I lean, and the rope answers, remembering through muscle memory to give half an arm's length, no more. [659]
A sudden blister of air buckles the starboard wing, and the ship shudders, then rights itself with a stubborn breath. [679]
The parachute buckle rings against the rail, not pretty but certain, a small metallic vow keeping its part of the ritual. [700]
Below, the crew keep pace with my taps, and together we shape a corridor of calmer air as if plaiting rope from night. [723]
The ship kisses the cradle with a sigh, the wing folding like a tired hand, and laughter arrives dusty and grateful. [744]
The pilot climbs out and meets my eyes without being asked, and we exchange the small nod that says we are not done paying. [768]
The weight on my ribs loosens, not fully gone, but carried better, a harness adjusted rather than a dismissal. [787]</story>
