<story>On a cobalt terrace at dusk, I waited, the sea breathing like a tired archivist. [15]
I am a guilt-ridden black market genealogist, and the trade salts every hour. [28]
People come wanting ancestors that shine, and I manufacture false memories to suit their wants. [43]
I tell myself I am recording the heart, but the ledger aches with forgery. [57]
Tonight I had come under the weight of unspoken words, heavier than the coastal stones. [72]
Mara would meet me here, the woman whose story I had twisted into a marketable braid. [88]
She wanted to discover the weight of a withheld truth, and so did I. [102]
The truth had been mine to tell once, before brine and fear went to work. [117]
Years ago I had quelled a scandal by sewing her lineage from seaworn scraps. [131]
I called it protection, but it was a padded silence with needles still inside. [145]
The only artifact I kept honest was a watch hand, thin and salt stained. [159]
It had snapped from a lighthouse watch the night a storm pulled her father away. [174]
On its needle I threaded my vow, then bartered the rest of the timepiece. [188]
I told Mara her father had abandoned her, because buyers needed a villain to justify outcome. [204]
What they bought was my cowardice, bound in parchment and lacquered in therapeutic suggestion. [218]
Now the terrace wore its evening blues, and gulls stitched small commas above the rail. [233]
A sieved hush sifted from the alleys, like wind searching a sieve of reed mats. [248]
Mara arrived without ceremony, eyes the color of the tide after it thinks of retreat. [263]
We stood in that hush and traded breath the way misers trade pennies. [276]
You invented me, she said, and the sentence landed as soft as a stone. [290]
I said, I can unmake what I made, but only if we return to origins. [305]
Not the documents, she said, but the shore, where your false lineage first touched sand. [320]
So we walked to the forgotten beach that most maps misname, Parliament of Wood. [334]
The tide leaves minutes there, curled into driftwood like letters addressed to no one. [348]
Our city once recorded births and deaths by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore. [364]
Every carving carried a cut of name, a tide published ledger praying to be read. [379]
I had faked that language, carving replicas that fit my clients like stolen coats. [393]
Now I knelt and let the surf offer its archive while her shadow kept witness. [408]
We searched for hours, and in that sieving I heard a hush learn to speak. [423]
The first plank read nothing we knew, only salt lines and a childlike sun. [437]
The second named a keeper, Abel Mora, and the third named a debt unpaid. [451]
The fourth plank carried her surname beside mine, carved shallow to hide from storms. [465]
My breath broke; I had been deep in the story all along, the absent witness. [480]
I had manufactured the false memory that saved my name and misnamed her grief. [494]
The watch hand lay where the fifth carving pointed, alight with wet dusk like a compass. [510]
Mara lifted it and said, this belonged to Abel, and he was my father. [524]
He did not abandon me; he saved the boy ferrying records, and that boy was you. [540]
The withheld truth weighed there, not an anvil, but a patient tide changing stone. [554]
I told her how I forged the planks that went to market and broke her map. [570]
I told her I had spent years trying to quell attention rather than earn forgiveness. [585]
She listened, the watch hand catching the last light like a single second refusing to drown. [601]
I expected fury; what arrived was tempered regret, the same climate that lives in old photographs. [617]
We gathered the true planks and left the forged ones to soak until their ink surrendered. [633]
Back on the terrace the city unrolled its lamps, and a sieved hush returned between us. [649]
I offered her the archives I still kept, the microfilm of lies and their receipts. [664]
Burn them, she said, but keep one page, so you remember what forgetting costs. [678]
I kept the page that named Abel Mora, and slid the rest into the salt. [693]
The sea accepted the paper as if it already knew, tearing it to clean syllables. [708]
Tomorrow we will return to the shore and publish the names the tide preserved. [722]
Not in courts, but in kitchens and on balconies, where inheritance is spoken and cooked. [737]
We will seed the city with memory that does not bruise when touched. [750]
Until then we stood quiet, each of us holding silence like a lantern with shutters. [765]
The terrace went cobalt again as if night could be restarted, and I almost believed. [780]
Belief, like time, can lose a hand and still point to what remains. [793]</story>
