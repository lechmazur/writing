<story>The lamp died with a sigh, and the room above me remembered every shipwreck. [14]
After the lamp flickers out, the lantern room keeps glowing with what it cannot forget. [29]
I sleep there sometimes, though I tell the harbor I prefer the bunk below. [43]
They call me keeper, but I am just the last person who said yes. [57]
The reticent lighthouse supply skipper brings flour, oil, and silence every Wednesday at slack tide. [72]
He is warmly observant, like a tidepool holding sunlight without saying what it reflects. [86]
We speak in pieces, the way gulls trade cries between gusts. [97]
Between us runs an anonymous letter chain, older than the rust beneath the ladder. [111]
The island writes to the mainland, and the mainland returns, always unsigned, always unmistakable. [125]
We fold the letters small as shells and tuck them behind a way of stacking stones as messages. [143]
Three stones means danger, four means soup, five means the one you love is still waiting. [159]
The skipper reads the stacks like scripture and never moves them except to protect the message. [175]
He brings me the paper and collects what I leave in the crook of the stairs. [191]
The letters are weather and balm, and sometimes both. [200]
A widow writes about the cough of waves that stole the name from her gate. [215]
A diver replies with an unsigned map of the rips, drawn on the back of a bill. [232]
A schoolchild confesses to loving the light because it made soup taste less lonely. [246]
I answer those with questions, and nobody signs, and everyone is recognized anyway. [259]
We do this to bottle the feeling of safety and pass it hand to hand unseen. [275]
There is no jar big enough for a coast, so we use pages and stones. [290]
Tonight the lamp gave up mid-storm, and the haunted lantern room filled with birds we could not see. [308]
Wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath around a sleeping child. [321]
I lit a candle and found a piece of sea glass in the dust by the pedestal. [338]
It was green as a harbor light, worn thin by years of being almost broken. [353]
I held it to the candle and the ghosts clung to the edges like salt. [368]
All I have ever wanted is to protect the tender hush that arrives after weather. [383]
Safety is not the absence of loss; it is the ache that shines enough to guide. [399]
I pressed the sea glass into my palm and heard footsteps from a year that never ended. [416]
The previous keeper had drowned on a calm day, which is a kind of forgetting. [431]
People feared the lighthouse loved him more than it loved them, and the feeling turned to myth. [448]
So the anonymous letter chain swelled, as if words could shore the gap in the tide. [464]
Tonight I wrote, We are still here, and I slipped it under the candle stub. [479]
Below, I built five stones for love, and one small shell for the keeper who never arrives. [496]
The skipper came early, face wet with fog, hat beaded like a net of rain. [511]
He saw the stones, looked toward the sleeping mainland, and took the letter without a word. [527]
In his pocket he had folded pages for me, a packet stitched with fishline and patience. [543]
He left a lantern wick and a glance that asked if the hauntings were kind tonight. [559]
They are, I said, and he nodded with the gravity of a beach at low tide. [575]
When he was gone, the room settled, as if the ghosts were listening for oars. [590]
I read the packet aloud to the empty air because the letters prefer to be heard. [606]
One was from a boy who had seen my light and drawn courage around his bowl. [622]
Another was a recipe for stew that tastes like a harbor even when storms forget you. [638]
Another simply said, Keep the glass, and know there are people you will never meet guarding you. [655]
I put the sea glass on the sill and the candle brightened as if gratified. [670]
Outside, the stacked stones wore moonlight and spoke privately to any soul passing in fog. [685]
I felt the ache again, the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron. [700]
It is made of strangers reaching, of reticent hands, of voices that choose to arrive without names. [717]
It is what I pass along, parcel by parcel, as if carrying warmth in a paper boat. [734]
The letter chain is our current, and the sea glass is our small green lighthouse inside. [750]
When dawn finally shrugged into the windows, the room lost its birds, but not its listening. [766]
I wrote one last line, Thank you, and left five stones where waves could almost reach them. [783]
If safety could be bottled, it would taste like candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands. [800]</story>
