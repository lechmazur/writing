<story>I am the late-shift pier lamplighter, keeping the harbor awake with points of quiet fire. [15]
On the night the fog thinned to a meteor hush, lanterns lifted from the city like careful planets. [33]
I had promised myself to follow their reflections underwater, during a sky lantern release, to discover the color of sound. [53]
Such a pledge was ridiculous on land and perfectly reasonable below, where the harbor floor veers toward the forgotten library inside a sunken ship. [77]
I strapped my tinderbox shut, tucked my gloves, and slipped into the water with the ease of someone who has practiced leaving. [99]
The lamps behind me kept their posts, and above me the first lanterns budded into the sky, each a mild star. [120]
I carried a hotel skeleton key tag on a cord around my throat, a brass oval stamped with the number that visited my dreams. [144]
I had found it snagged in a piling long ago, and it felt like a door even without a key. [164]
Below, kelp curtains parted, and the ribs of the sunken ship yawned, muttering like wet timbered bells. [181]
I swam into the hold that had become a corridor, then into the corridor that had become stacks, and there the forgotten library waited. [205]
Books slept in silt, their skins furred with salt, and when I brushed them the lettering woke in a glow like algae remembering lightning. [229]
This was why I had come: to read the luminous vows rumored to be stored here, the promises sailors wrote when ink refused to stay dark. [255]
They believed such shining words could signify safe passage, or at least honest wreckage. [269]
I am not superstitious, but I am the sort of person who hides behind truth, hoping it will shield me from its shadow. [292]
So I said aloud, into my mask, the thing that would not be comforted: I wanted to discover the color of sound. [314]
Not a metaphor, but a hue, the spin of it, the tint at its edges, blue if sorrowed, ocher if warm, indigo when it forgave. [339]
I moved by wandering purposefully, letting the drift nudge me as my legs steered, a compromise between fate and practice. [359]
Where my hands hovered, the pages brightened, not white but nacre, the sort of light a shell keeps after listening to tides. [381]
One ledger held a log of rooms booked on a ship converted into a floating hotel, and inside it lay the twin of my hotel skeleton key tag. [409]
The number matched, and the page glimmered with a careful script: a vow written to the wind in exchange for listening faithfully. [431]
I took the tag between my fingers and the water hummed, a pearly vibration tarnished at the edges with rust, like moonlight nicked by old knives. [457]
Above, more lanterns rose; their shadows poured down through the surface and came to rest on my shoulders like temporary birds. [478]
The library breathed, and I realized the vows were not meant to charm luck but to train the ear toward patience. [499]
Each glowing sentence drew a thread through me, knotting me to seafloor quiet until my heartbeat settled into a tethered metronome. [520]
Then the hum I held was no longer merely a sensation; it had a shade, a subtle not-green, not-yellow, a color like breath seen on glass and promptly erased. [549]
I mouthed the vow to the water, and the vow answered by tinting the hum with a thawing silver, not bright, not dull, a midwinter dusk of tone. [577]
Sound was a colorable weather, I understood, a slowly staining veil, and this ship had gathered its palette by listening for years without interruption. [601]
If I wanted to keep the silver, I would have to earn it, not borrow it, and the vows showed me how. [623]
They taught a lesson in standing still while moving, an art of being available without begging, a practice of tending brightness others see first. [647]
I rose and fell with the hull as the tide sighed, keeping my breath even, and more silver returned to the hum like memory relearned. [672]
Through the hull slats I could see the procession continuing, the sky lantern release sewing constellations where the city had opened its hands. [695]
Their ash was already descending like patient snow, freckling the surface, and the library swallowed each speck as if saving sentences for later. [718]
I tucked the ledger back, pressed my hotel skeleton key tag against the page, and left my own small vow: I would light the pier without tiring of attention. [747]
It was not magic, but it was binding, and the water around me settled to a listening that asked nothing and gave me silver to carry. [773]
When I surfaced, wet with a vow and a color, the lanterns drifting homeward appeared to be the very notes I had heard, more seen than sounded. [800]</story>
