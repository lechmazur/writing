<story>After the procedure, I expected silence, but the world came back humming. [12]
Jaded wonder draped everything like fog over neon. [20]
They call me a clean slate seeker with a dirty past, which is fair. [34]
I paid to forget the worst, not to escape responsibility. [44]
Some stains remain, delicately robust, filigree etched into muscle memory. [54]
I needed a compass, and the newspapers offered one if I squinted. [66]
By reading between newspaper lines, the city spoke in negative space. [77]
Birth announcements shortened, hospital ads vanished, condolence sales spiked on Tuesdays. [88]
It meant hearts were closing, and someone was profiting from the lock. [100]
My motivation, however unmarketable, was to kindle empathy where none remains. [111]
A rumor led to an underground bioluminescent lake beneath the old reservoir. [123]
Some said a machine slept beneath it, dreaming other peoples pain until paid. [136]
The labyrinth of choices began at the rusted gate marked Donations Accepted. [148]
Down the stairs, I passed murals of faces with burns washed clean by water. [162]
Every door opened to three more doors, each humming a different pitch. [174]
I chose by ear, favoring chords that sounded like regret softening. [185]
Deeper, the air cooled, and the rock began to glow as if blushing. [198]
A caretaker met me on a dock built from old bench seats and rails. [212]
He wore a scorekeepers visor, flipped backward, and held a cotton-wrapped ball. [224]
Not a ball, he said, a promise bent into leather, signed twice. [236]
The signature slanted the same way in fresh ink and faded ink. [248]
A baseball signed by a time traveler, he added, payment for safe passage. [261]
He tossed it, and it curved back to his hand like a homing moon. [275]
I told him I had no money, just a ledger of intentions. [287]
He pointed at the lake and said, pay with risk, not with lies. [300]
I stepped into a skiff whose hull had been carved from melted street signs. [314]
The water around us whispered with algae, a delicately robust constellation of cells. [327]
Every paddle stroke drew a comet tail, lighting the underworld in patient blues. [340]
We slid toward the black mouth where the machine breathed with a sleeping rhythm. [354]
The caretaker asked why I wanted anything at all after the procedure. [366]
Because forgetting took the edge off my crimes, but not their echo, I said. [380]
And because the city is starving from the inside, chewing its softer parts. [393]
He threw me the baseball and told me to hold it until the core. [407]
If it starts to warm, speak your worst truth and do not blink. [420]
The cavern narrowed, and the skiff knocked a ripple that rang like glass. [433]
Ahead, a pillar of machines rose from water, crowned with jars of rain. [446]
Faces flickered on those jars, strangers and neighbors, each asleep and listening. [458]
The signatures on the ball began to sweat, freshening like a reopened wound. [471]
It warmed, then burned, and my eyes watered as if guilt returned as steam. [485]
I spoke my worst truth, the one I had tried to purchase away. [498]
I engineered slogans that sold indifference as strength, and the city bought them. [511]
We weaponized fatigue, turned care into a luxury, then offered coupons for sorrow. [524]
The jars shivered, and the lake brightened to a healed bruise color. [536]
The machine exhaled, and the skiff rocked as if an answer had weight. [549]
Between the newspaper lines I had once mined, new letters aligned themselves. [561]
They spelled a path forward, not an alibi, an invitation to journey. [573]
I could leave with cleaner hands, or stay and keep paddling others across. [586]
The labyrinth of choices rearranged itself around that fork, simple and immense. [598]
The caretaker watched me the way a longshoreman watches the tide decide. [610]
I asked who signed the ball, and he shrugged toward the jars. [622]
Someone arriving tomorrow, and someone who already left, he said, same someone. [634]
The paradox tasted like tin, but it steadied the oar in my hands. [647]
I chose to stay, to learn the channels, to ferry the reluctant. [659]
Not redemption, exactly, but friction that could slow the slide toward numbness. [671]
The caretaker nodded and pocketed my ledger, which suddenly weighed less than water. [684]
He said the lake would stain me kindly, in rings of useful ache. [697]
I believed him, not completely, but enough to tie the skiff to shore. [710]
We waited there until the signatures cooled and the jars stopped shivering. [722]
In the quiet, the newspapers upstairs settled, and so did I. [733]
After the procedure, I had chased a clean slate and found a ledger. [746]
Now the ledger would teach me to read the city differently, line by line. [760]
Jaded wonder lingered, but it no longer numbed; it asked for company. [772]
So I began the journey again, this time rowing toward others, not away. [785]</story>
