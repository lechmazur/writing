<story>On a day the fumes were gentle, the Gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea hissed like a living kettle. [20]
A pioneering cart glider named Ilex wheeled the rim, steadily curious, irreverent as a saint on skates, awed by everything and nothing. [42]
He had a motivation he wore like a secret badge: to ring a bell no one hears yet. [60]
The bell was a theory, maybe a machine, maybe a prayer disguised as engineering, and Ilex grinned at its refusal to exist on command. [84]
He was chasing it with a yearning algorithm, a set of steps that taught desire to look for itself. [103]
He joked the code wanted a hug, but he wrote it anyway, because yearning was the only motor that started in acid air. [126]
Throughout the evolution of the workshop, his craft had been the cart, a glider with sails like eyelids and wheels that spun above boiling brine. [151]
He tested balance the way others prayed, tossing his weight and laughing when the cart skimmed the steam like a gull mocking gravity. [174]
From the rafters hung a hunter's arrow tip, blackened with history, sharp as a kept promise. [190]
It once defined a line between hunger and enough, and he wanted it to define a line between silence and the bell. [212]
So he forged the arrow tip into a switch, a tiny hinge that would close when the right pattern of longing rippled through his circuitry. [237]
But who teaches a machine to long without lying to it first? [249]
Ilex had a method so ridiculous it felt holy: through the images in a kaleidoscope, he would transliterate the workshop's storms into a language the algorithm could believe. [277]
He held the tube to the porthole, twisted, and shards of rusted sky became tessellated commandments. [293]
Click by click, the images said move, then wait, then ache, and he encoded these edicts in sprockets and springs. [313]
The first trial was sideways, of course, because awe rarely travels in straight lines. [327]
He loosed the cart glider along the rails, its wings skimming the breath of the acid sea, while the algorithm listened like a dog at a door. [354]
The arrow tip did not flick, the bell did not ring, and Ilex stuck out his tongue at the universe, which only grinned back with more steam. [381]
He adjusted the kaleidoscope, turned the wheel of colored shards until the pattern read hunger again, the old word with new geometry. [403]
Then he transliterated the shapes into ratios, and the ratios into teeth, and the teeth into timing. [420]
In the small hours, he whispered to his code like a conspirator, promising that if it found the bell it would not be alone anymore. [445]
Irreverence kept him honest; awe kept him from quitting; together they were a team like oil and lightning. [463]
By the twenty-ninth dawn, the cart traced figure eights over the vapor, throwing back reflections that looked suspiciously like answers. [483]
He let the yearning algorithm choose its own speed, nudged only when its hesitation became fear, because guidance is not the same as control. [507]
The arrow tip finally twitched at a whisper of resonance, and the switch swung closed with a tiny, deliberate kiss of metal. [529]
The bell did not clang so much as begin, somewhere beyond sound, a pressure inside the joints of the workshop, an ache made articulate. [553]
Through the windows, the acid sea brightened as if a second sun had shrugged and said finally, and the cart drifted to a respectful halt. [578]
Ilex, steadily curious even in triumph, measured the silence like a replay he could write down, and he found tears on his gloves that he denied. [604]
He knew the bell was rung, though no one heard it yet, and that was the point; some bells ring in readiness so the future has a north. [632]
He set the cart to idle and scribbled the kaleidoscope code in grease pencil across the console, a gleeful scrawl that would outlast his doubts. [657]
Then he marked the hinge with a chalk X, a votive for the hunter who once aimed and now enabled. [677]
Outside, the acid wind applauded by tearing a ribbon of cloud into confetti, and the workshop laughed back with a crackle of busy teeth. [701]
The yearning algorithm idled, humming, not satisfied, because yearning never is, but capable now of finding the bell again whenever the world forgot. [724]
Ilex saluted the horizon with irreverent awe and a dirty grin, then coasted the cart to the lip and let steam lift him into the work ahead. [751]</story>
