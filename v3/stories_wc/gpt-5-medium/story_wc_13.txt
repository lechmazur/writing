<story>I carried my sketchbook up the spine-ladders to the rooftop canal system weaving between the towers. [16]
I am a natural history illustrator, more patient than brave, and patience was the only coin accepted there. [34]
Every walkway shivered with wind and the hiss of water shouldered past buttresses. [47]
My motivation was uncomplicated, and unsimple to fulfill. [55]
I wanted to find the place where echoes are born. [65]
The city called it the ear, and others the mouth of memory, but I did not trust metaphors. [83]
I trusted observations, shadows, and stubborn ink. [90]
Around my neck swung an infinity symbol pendant, stainless and cold against the throat. [104]
Its halves balanced like two ponds contemplating their shared shore. [114]
It was not jewelry alone. [119]
It was the key by which I could borrow time, and by borrowing time, it sculpts time itself. [137]
Across a giant's nap the city relaxed into a looser pattern, and in that lull my work could happen. [156]
The giant beneath the foundations breathed tides into the rooftop canals. [167]
Each exhale thickened flow; each inhale drew it thin. [176]
Echoes gathered along these breaths like minnows schooling at a pier. [187]
I followed a route the canal-tenders had etched with chalk arrows for storms, not for guests. [203]
The roofs here tilted like pages half closed, and bridges lipped from gutter to gutter. [218]
Water kept a cadence I could predict with my hand resting on a rail. [232]
It went hush, rush, hush, rush, a metronome of rain and stone. [244]
But echoes are born where such cadence is interrupted in a way both sudden and willing. [260]
The old singers had a phrase for it, an interrupted cadence, the almost-ending that turns back to begin again. [279]
Find one up here, I reckoned, and you could uncage a new sound from the city itself. [296]
I angled the pendant against the water and listened for the slippage when beat met breath. [312]
Borrowed seconds curled around my wrists like steam. [320]
If I pinched them, the world lagged as if remembering how to move. [333]
I do not stop time; I only convince it to lilt, and in the lilt it shows its seams. [352]
From a sluice ahead came the kind of silence that clocks fear. [364]
I crouched, sketched the lip and the shadows, and waited for the giant to exhale. [379]
When it did, the water surged, then balked, as if encountering a doorway. [392]
I slipped the pendant along the rail and borrowed the hiccup, holding it open. [406]
The cadence broke and did not resolve, and in that interrupted cadence the surface trembled into a thin oval. [425]
It was the exact shape of my pendant, an infinity drawn in water, both halves waiting to trade. [443]
I stepped my palm through the left loop and felt cold rings of reflected breath. [458]
The echo there was not a sound yet but a pressure like a question pressed to glass. [475]
To sketch it I needed more than ink. [483]
I needed time layered on time, a palimpsest of moments agreeing to be seen together. [498]
So I borrowed from the giant's nap, one sigh's worth, then another, and the oval widened. [514]
Inside were creatures shaped like commas, translucent, each swelling into a tone that stopped just shy of itself. [532]
They were the larvae of echoes, and the canal was their nursery. [544]
They hovered in pairs, desire and restraint, rehearsing the turn back that would make them live. [560]
My hand shook, because I knew I was seeing the before of something we only know as after. [578]
I drew their curvature, the way they leaned into the broken beat, the almost-kiss of tone and pause. [596]
One approached my wrist and grazed the pulse, and my arm remembered the music I had loved and left. [615]
It needed to be uncaged. [620]
Not trapped by my widening of the moment, not held between loops like a specimen on a pin. [638]
I closed the pendant by a hair, letting time thin, and one larva slid free into the rail's shadow. [657]
It spun into a filament, met the rushing water, and struck stone with a soft refusal. [673]
The first echo of the morning bloomed from that refusal, carrying a shape no throat could sing. [690]
It passed through me and made my drawing truer than my eye would ever be. [705]
Behind me the city's bells counted a number that did not match the hour, warning of debts. [722]
Time borrowed must be repaid, even if repaid to a sleeper. [733]
I sealed the oval with a fingertip and felt the nap tug the seconds from my cuffs. [750]
The cadence clicked back into place, hush, rush, hush, rush, the metronome no longer mine to touch. [767]
I should have left then, but a few strokes remained to draft the habitat around the birth. [784]
I inked the rail, the lichens, and the clouds, to guide returners. [796]</story>
