<story>I lock the chase and ink the forme while the night forgets names above my roof. [16]
They call me the cryptic letterpress operator, because the words I print arrive sideways, lean, and then stand like question marks. [37]
My workshop smells of oil, citrus, and topaz dust, because I set type in a topaz workshop under stars. [56]
Between vanishing stars, I register the sheets and listen for the click of metal logic becoming breath. [73]
My motive is simple enough to frighten me: to understand the mathematics of emotion. [87]
If numbers can weigh mass and light, perhaps ligatures can weigh grief and wonder, and set them flush. [105]
I am a person who habitually borrows personalities, not by theft but by careful audition, stepping into voices the way printers step into ink. [129]
Tonight I am Maris, my late mentor, crisp and patient, all margins, because her ghost knows the spacing where my courage fails. [151]
She left me a crate with a velvet-lined drawer, inside which sleeps a halo fragment that hums whenever I align a sentence to truth. [175]
The fragment fell from some saint or astronaut, depending on who asks, because my answers disorient through deliberate ambiguity. [194]
What matters is how it conducts feeling into type metal, and how the metal keeps that charge until a reader touches the ink. [217]
I call the process transposed empathy, a reprinting of nerves into other nerves, not substitution, but a musical key change that preserves melody. [240]
When I proof the form, the halo fragment warms, and my borrowed Maris manner becomes a bridge the ink can cross. [261]
Across an alley the observatory blinks, its dome turning like a sleepy lid, cataloging which lights vanish and which refuse oblivion. [282]
The astronomers come down at odd hours with coffee and fables, paying in star maps for posters and prayers they pretend are announcements. [305]
They label the time Between vanishing stars, as if the sky itself sets the interval for mortal errands. [323]
I set a broadside titled Cryptic Letterpress Operator, not as a boast but a diagnostic, because the shop wants clarity and I want turbulence. [347]
Lucid turbulence, Maris whispers, and I feel her steadiness pull my scattered vectors into an orbit that still refuses rest. [367]
A couple arrives, their grief held like unmailed letters, asking for a piece that will help them forgive a brother who ran toward fire. [391]
I listen as them, because I habitually borrow personalities to calibrate the press to hearts I do not yet recognize as mine. [413]
The halo fragment brightens, a thumbprint of dawn in the drawer, and the room becomes the Topaz workshop under stars they imagined when they were young. [439]
I choose Caslon for their patience, set the words forgiveness is a rotating mirror, and ink with the tiny static the fragment will grant. [463]
When they read the proof, the woman feels his terror as arithmetic, a sum carried across the line, a clean ledger that hurts a little less. [489]
He feels her stubborn love as an angle that refuses closure, and in that geometry their eyes meet for the first time in months. [513]
Transposed empathy is not charity, I tell them; it is rotation on a circle no one owns, a trading of coordinates to see the same center. [539]
They leave a map of a dim region where a star went missing years ago, and I promise a poster that will not heal but will compute. [566]
Alone again, I set my own confession, and the halo fragment cools, asking me to stop pretending Maris has all the courage I need. [590]
I pull the proof, and it reads: I have been using my ambiguity to protect myself, but its best purpose is to disorient fear. [614]
The press shudders, the stars tick, the observatory murmurs, and I measure, finally, the distance between cruelty and mercy in points and picas. [637]
It is a number that cannot be written, only approached, like a limit that keeps inviting the curve closer without letting it arrive. [660]
I set a final line, a promise shaped as a question, and the halo fragment glows as if hearing a distant choir learn a new key. [686]
Will the sky forgive me for editing its grief into ours, and will I forgive the sky for going out while I master its arithmetic. [711]
I sign the broadside with my smallest name, sweep topaz grit from the tympan, and open the door to the chilled, subtracting night. [734]
Across the alley a new blank appears where a star had been, and the absence washes my hands cleaner than solvent. [755]
I leave the fragment on the windowsill to drink in the vanished light, and I begin setting the map into a salvaged future tense. [779]</story>
