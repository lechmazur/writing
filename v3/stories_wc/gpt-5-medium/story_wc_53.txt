<story>After the carousel halts, the world remembers how to hold its breath. [12]
Above the clouds, a kinetic lagoon swells and subsides like thinking water. [24]
I arrive as a resolute scavenger, pockets jangling with hinges and promises. [36]
My motives are simple and unbearable: to negotiate with my own ghost. [48]
The lagoon churns softly, a fractured stillness stitched with ripples and air. [60]
Every movement here is gentle and decisive, like a scalpel closing a wound. [73]
I am chronologically confused, or maybe the hours are, slipping their leashes. [85]
Time smears, and ambition, once sharp as tin, has eroded into sludge. [97]
Eroded ambitions sink in the lagoon, making muffled clinks against submerged rails. [109]
Somewhere below us, the skeleton of the carousel sits, patient as a witness. [122]
When the music stopped, I took the silence like a map and climbed. [135]
There are ladders of wind that only scavengers know, rungs of rumor. [147]
I ascend by collecting fragments of overheard stories, knotting them into rope. [159]
That rope lets me cross to the lagoon's platform, a raft of turbines. [172]
Windmills turn the water into memory, and memory turns me into wind. [184]
I put down my sack and take out the disposable camera wheel. [196]
It survived years of pocket grit; the camera drowned, but this gear spins. [209]
When I thumb it backward, I hear faint clicks like bones learning arithmetic. [222]
I cannot wind the past forward, but I can choose which click to trust. [236]
My ghost hates bargains that smell rehearsed; it demands authenticity, and regret. [248]
Regret is the bargaining chip I both hoard and spend, a paradoxical currency. [261]
Once, before the carousel slowed, I promised to build a city of pennies. [274]
I stacked copper towers on saucers, dreaming a skyline that fit my palm. [287]
The rain dissolved it, and my ambitions eroded, their edges seamed with green. [300]
The lagoon remembers that hue; every wave shows me what I would not salvage. [314]
I speak to the tide as if phoning a friend I betrayed. [326]
By collecting fragments of overheard stories, I bait my ghost from its hiding. [339]
I repeat a fisherman's proverb about hooks carved from mothers' patience. [350]
I whisper a child's rhyme about stairs that lead upward into yesterday. [362]
I recite a ticket-taker's confession, that he punched holes the size of exits. [375]
The stories knot together, forming a bridge of murmurs across the foam. [387]
My ghost steps onto it, weightless and heavy with all the time I misfiled. [401]
It is chronologically confused too; it wears my childhood before my scars. [413]
We meet in the middle, where the lagoon's churn becomes an audible hush. [426]
I offer the disposable camera wheel, asking it to click our truce into place. [440]
The ghost demands payment in verbs: admit, forgive, rebuild, stay. [450]
I admit the penny city was a coin bath for pride. [461]
I forgive the rain for obeying the gravity I ignored. [471]
I promise to rebuild only what can stand in weathered light. [482]
I stay, though the wind-ladders groan, though the carousel bones call me back. [495]
The ghost listens, and for once, it does not try to outpace the tide. [509]
It fingers the camera wheel and sets it turning, not forward, not back. [522]
The clicks align with the lagoon's percussion, a syncopation of possible days. [534]
Frames I never took bloom inside the water: handshakes, breakfasts, apologies, repairs. [546]
I regret aloud the years I spent plundering futures for trinkets of certainty. [559]
The word regret echoes, gathers barnacles, and sinks with a relieved shudder. [571]
My ghost nods, and the bridge of murmurs grows planks, then rails. [583]
It tells me the only contract worth signing is written in restarted habits. [596]
So I wash the sack, I count bolts, I label salvaged promises by use. [610]
A turbine becomes a kettle; a hinge becomes a book's quiet vertebra. [622]
I catalog my eroded ambitions and find they are sand good for gardens. [635]
The lagoon approves, lifting small waves that clap like careful hands. [646]
Above us, clouds thin to reveal other lagoons, other rafts of patient machinery. [659]
Each holds someone negotiating with a ghost that resembles a mirror. [670]
Their fractured stillness harmonizes with ours, overlapping silences like translucent leaves. [681]
I ask my ghost if it will stay until I learn the noon again. [695]
It laughs without sound, then teaches me to measure minutes by turbine sighs. [708]
One sigh is enough to check a bolt; two, to brew tea for forgiveness. [722]
Three sighs, and the camera wheel stops, containing a frame of truce. [734]
We do not expose it; we simply know it exists and proceed. [746]
The carousel below creaks in its sleep, dreaming of revolving seas. [757]
I tell it rest now, we are learning to move without running. [769]
The ghost fades not from absence but from agreement, leaving tools in my hands. [783]
After the carousel halts, the world exhales, and breath becomes a craft. [795]</story>
