<story>The lush orchard spanning the rafters of an abandoned cathedral had gone quiet with withheld breath. [16]
I came back after the breach of contract, when the Restoration Council stopped paying and started forgetting. [33]
I am a quartz-eye mender, good with cracked timbers and tired sap, bad with goodbyes. [48]
The choir loft creaked under my boots as if it remembered better footsteps than mine. [63]
Above, branches arched like ribs, heavy with peaches and pears and a small ache of neglect. [79]
You would not think vows could rot fruit, but I had seen stranger grafts take and fail. [96]
Their order once took deciduous vows, shedding promises each autumn so new ones could leaf in spring. [113]
When the contract went sour, the shedding stopped, and the orchard thickened with unspent intention. [128]
I came for another reason too, quieter and sharper than money, to bridge generational wisdom. [143]
My daughter had left after our last quarrel, leaving only a small tin and a missing laugh. [160]
I carried the tin everywhere, not opening it, afraid of what it might stop me from hearing. [177]
On the nave's edge a child waited, endearingly feisty, all elbows and questions, refusing to be left behind. [195]
Mira, apprentice by accident and by insistence, had followed me from the river market. [209]
She said nothing about me being a father who could not father rightly, and that helped. [225]
Instead she poked the dangling roots with a stick and asked what made trees keep their balance. [242]
Vows, I said, and luck, and pruning at the right time, and a little lying to yourself. [259]
She laughed like a dropped marble rolling, and that sound found the cracks my quartz eye saw. [276]
We mapped the stress lines through the rafters, tracing where sap slurred and where fruit weighted decisions. [293]
Everywhere, old promises had clung like burrs, and the limbs bent trying to carry what should have fallen. [311]
We needed to start the shedding again, but we had no choir, no abbot, no calendar left. [328]
So I set to work using forgotten bag contents, the way the river teaches repair by drowning you first. [347]
Out came the pruning hook with a nick in its jaw, a spool of thin copper, a cracked vial of spores. [368]
At the bottom, wrapped in old receipts, lay my daughter's hair ribbon, still faint with her tireless scent. [386]
I closed my fist over it until the quartz throbbed, and Mira pretended not to notice. [402]
The ritual would be simple: a bell rung with a new tether, a cutting made, a promise spoken and let go. [423]
I climbed where the ribs met the sky, tied the ribbon to the frayed bell rope, and breathed. [441]
Mira recited from a psalter she could not read, each mispronounced leaf dearer to the branches than correct scripture. [460]
I answered with new words that sounded borrowed, because that is how beginnings speak when elders are absent. [478]
The bell took the ribbon's color and rang like a throat clearing, and the canopy shivered. [494]
Leaves loosened with little sighs, vows letting go the way grief sometimes does when you breathe half a second longer. [514]
Fruit lifted its shoulders, sap ran, and somewhere a collapsed pew remembered it could be a bench again. [532]
My quartz eye refracted the change into rainbows on the ceiling, as if the saints were approving mechanics. [550]
Mira grinned and shoved me, both hands, for being sentimental and for being late to obvious work. [567]
I told her wisdom is what you trip over and pretend you meant to kick, and she approved. [585]
We kept at it, pruning, splicing, whispering, letting the spent oaths drift to the choir floor like husks. [603]
I tied a final graft with the daughter's hair ribbon, and the knot held like an answer. [620]
Maybe she would return to claim it, or maybe Mira would wear it, a bridge the color of peaches. [639]
Either way, the orchard and the girl and the absent daughter shared the same stubborn curve in their roots. [658]
The contract could stay broken if it liked, because some economies grow from gifts the books cannot tally. [676]
What mattered was to persist, together, until the rafters remembered their orchard and the orchard remembered a family. [694]
When we climbed down, the bell was still swaying, and the air tasted like the first bite after fasting. [713]
I left the tin unopened, because sometimes a father must wait for a daughter to open her own time. [732]
Above us, the deciduous vows kept falling, crisp as pages, and the nave filled with a readable rustle. [750]
We walked out through the empty doors into a day that could forgive the breach of contract by harvest. [769]
Behind us the bell settled, the ribbon fluttered, and the cathedral learned to breathe on purpose again. [786]
Call it accidental wisdom, the kind that fixes you while fixing wood. [798]</story>
