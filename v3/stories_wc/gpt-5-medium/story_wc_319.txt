<story>Through the veil of sleep, I arrive at the frozen garden in mist and know I am late. [18]
Light pools like breath on glass, and beyond its pale edges the air refuses to decide. [34]
This is where the feral library guardian keeps watch over unwritten books and off-season stars. [49]
I am dimensionally homesick, a border-crosser who fell between shelves and woke with my address edited out. [66]
To keep from breaking, I practice interiorizing exteriors, folding each horizon inward until it whispers my name. [83]
The garden accepts this method the way ice accepts a leaf, with the patient glint of captured motion. [101]
At the center stands a sundial whose shadow has frozen mid-confession, aligning the boundaries of light with unspoken rules. [120]
I have come to make friends with uncertainty, because certainty exiled me and even certainty looked tired. [137]
The guardian appears without footsteps, a woman shaped by stacks and winter, all tenderness taught by wolves. [154]
She smells of vellum and salt, and her eyes catalogue me as if I were a misfiled season. [172]
Around her throat hangs a cultist's pendant, a crescent of black metal enclosing a bead of dawn. [189]
The bead is alive, and its small sunrise refuses to cross the line where the mist begins. [206]
We look at each other from opposite weather, and the sundial waits like a witness that cannot sign. [224]
I say I am lost, but not geographically, and she smiles as if finally someone speaks the dialect of erasure. [244]
She tells me her name in a hush of pages turning themselves, and asks what I will give to stay. [264]
I show my empty hands, a history of departures etched in the cold, and offer my willingness to wait. [283]
Waiting is not inaction here; it is binding, like thread pulled through a wound so the skin remembers itself. [302]
She nods and draws a circle with her thumb across the pendant, and dawn quivers but does not spill. [321]
This metal holds the charter of the library, she says, forged when pilgrims mistook the moon for a hinge. [340]
It teaches us where the boundaries of light refuse to translate, and where a page must end for mercy. [359]
To cross is to forget, she continues, but to interiorize is to carry, and the books prefer being carried. [378]
I tell her I have been carrying winters inside me for years, little climates clinking like secret glasses. [396]
She laughs quietly, because laughter here is a margin note, and unclips the pendant to weigh my intent. [414]
The bead swivels toward me, a small sun with an old accent, and I hear it ask where home is. [434]
I answer that home is a room made of thresholds, and that I am learning how not to lock them. [454]
The mist thickens until it carries weight, and I feel the pressure of other versions of this garden. [472]
I am dimensionally homesick again, but the ache is companionable, like a bench sharing cold with the sitter. [490]
The guardian teaches me to read by frostbite, to see which letters retreat first when the light narrows. [508]
We place the sundial's confession on my palm, and I interiorize its exiled noon until it becomes memory. [526]
Memory smokes like ice under pressure, making a fog that knows our names and does not demand a destination. [545]
The guardian returns the pendant, but the bead keeps a sliver of my breath, a tithe to belonging elsewhere. [564]
She asks what I will do when the garden thaws and the catalogue melts into rivers nobody memorized. [582]
I say I will wait beside the runoff and listen for spines clicking, and follow whichever stream forgets me last. [602]
She approves, because friendship with uncertainty requires reciprocity, and the river deserves a vote in our cartography. [619]
We sit with the sundial's arrested shadow, and the mist writes a syllabus on my coat sleeve with thaw. [638]
It says to practice foggy lucidity, to walk until vision blurs and then adjust the heart to focus. [656]
It says to carry doorways the way others carry luck, and to share them when the sky misplaces its hinges. [676]
When I rise to leave, the pendant brightens, casting a careful radius that stops short of the guardian's wild hair. [696]
We both respect the boundaries of light, because respect is how edges hold, and how libraries survive their storms. [715]
I leave by not leaving, interiorizing the garden, the mist, the waiting, until the world outside fits inside. [733]
Through the veil of sleep again, I return to my waking, carrying thresholds like books, and books like thresholds. [752]
The day is thinner for a breath, but it holds, and uncertainty sits beside me like a new friend. [771]</story>
