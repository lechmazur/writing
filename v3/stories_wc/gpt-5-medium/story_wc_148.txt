<story>They put the lighthouse prison off a jagged reef behind me like a rumor pinned to the horizon, but I kept rowing back. [23]
It was the only place where the hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup in my hands without spilling. [45]
People think of prisons as loud, but this one nested in copperlight repose, the metal stairs warm as coins and the surf speaking in a low sleepwalk. [72]
I am the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son, and I had come to trade false alarms for a truer bell. [94]
Before they find the bodies, a story has the freedom to go anywhere, and I wanted to thread a labyrinth with my own story before anyone closed it off. [123]
The lighthouse had been converted after the war into cells that looked outward, so every prisoner could hover at a window and see what they were not touching. [151]
Salt turned the locks green and the guards slower, and the gulls learned to laugh like they were practicing a verdict. [172]
I carried with me a lattice from confessional, wood scratched by centuries of guarded breath, salvaged from a chapel that had drowned in a storm. [197]
Through it, voices thinned and met without faces, and I needed that to talk to the unquiet in me who still forced wolves into every shadow. [223]
The lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly: briefly, tenderly, and never without the ache of the lid. [244]
From the pier, I entered through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades, reading the rubbed arcs like tide lines of hands that had tried to leave. [274]
Inside, the corridors were the ribs of a whale, echoing, and the guards let me wander because I said I was cataloging the corrosion for the heritage board. [302]
They did not know I was chasing hush, not the absence of sound but the place where sound surrenders to listening. [323]
When I pressed the lattice to the mouth of an old speaking tube, the walls confessed more than any priest; they told me about the hours when the keepers blinked in rhythm with waves. [357]
In a cell with a porthole shaped like a keyhole, I met a woman who measured days by how soon the foghorn could turn into a lullaby. [384]
She held a scrap of sea map and told me the compass was lying because people had buried iron under the island to tilt every choice. [410]
I told her my name, and I told her it all at once: I am the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son, and I am trying to become the echo that stops screaming. [444]
She nodded like gulls nod at wrecks, then pointed toward the stairs that spiraled up where the lens once turned ships away from stone. [468]
I climbed until I could feel the copper roof pressing heat into the air, and I set the lattice across the lantern room so the wind had to speak to me through its square patience. [503]
The hush gathered, a soft animal in a trap made of listening, and it told me why the doors stayed open and why the reef kept its teeth ready. [532]
A boat was coming with questions, and under the stairs a drain held answers that were not yet bodies but were practicing the stiffness of being found. [559]
If I spoke, they would weigh my words like fish; if I kept silent, I could steer the current of what came next, and that was why I had come, to thread a labyrinth with your own story. [597]
The tide hit the pilings in numbered beats, and I counted with it, and in the counting I felt my father's fables loosen their knots. [622]
He taught me how a warning can taste like sugar, and the city taught me how truth can taste like iron, but the lighthouse taught me another flavor, brine of a promise kept. [655]
I carried the lattice down and set it over the drain, and the muffled thing beneath it surrendered without words, as if the squares were doors and I was the tide turning the knobs. [689]
When the boat arrived, they would ask and I would answer in the measured way of a lens rotating, letting light through in segments that made a beam, and by then the hush would be guiding them, not the lie of my inheritance. [732]</story>
