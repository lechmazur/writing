<story>Above the clouds, the grotto lay verdant and quiet, holding blushing stillness like a careful breath in the late light. [20]
It was during the migration of the last monarch butterfly that I climbed there, seeking a listening place for truth. [40]
I called myself an esoteric realist, suspicious of fantasies yet attentive to the hidden structures shaping simple things and sufferings. [60]
My purpose felt transiently rooted but stubborn: to honor overlooked histories before the wind scoured them from tender stone faces. [80]
In the cave-mouth, water tapped an interrupted cadence, as if the mountain rehearsed loss while rehearsing respiration for our meeting. [100]
I began building temporary structures as signals, because recordings decay, but gestures can lodge briefly within wandering attention and mercy. [120]
I strewed reeds into triangles, balanced pebbles on bark, and traced circles of pollen, nothing meant to last beyond sunset. [140]
From my pouch I lifted a moth wing, freckled parchment from a night once mistaken for daybreak by a child. [160]
I knelt and tied a knot of grasses through the wing's fragile stem, marrying memory to the present air gently. [180]
The wing trembled, translating breeze into faint semaphore, and I felt the place read it with patient intelligence and kindness. [200]
I thought of forgotten keepers, people who fed larvae in basements, undocumented, dismissed, their names composting under municipal forgetfulness forever. [220]
To honor them, I did not speak; I arranged signs the wind might carry, soft syllables of leaf and stone. [240]
Each small structure stood transiently rooted, braced against a gust, then leaned, learning the grammar of falling without despair present. [260]
The monarch arrived as a burned syllable of orange, the last verb of a vanishing language seeking subject and witness. [280]
It circled me once, then settled near the wing, as if comparing chronicles, old night to dwindling day and duty. [300]
Blushing stillness blossomed wider, a quiet that was not absence but the full attention of a listening world made tangible. [320]
I told myself the cadence of survival had been interrupted by us, but an interrupted cadence can still resolve elsewhere. [340]
So I arranged a longer signal, laying fern stems in alternating lengths, long short long short, a heartbeat remembered accurately. [360]
I added stones for timing, a patient metronome for wings, and the monarch beat once, then held, understanding our grammar. [380]
The moth wing flashed, its dullness turned oracle under sun, and shadows translated the pattern onto the grotto walls slowly. [400]
I was not summoning magic; I was asking for witness, evidence woven from patience and correspondences even skeptics admit eventually. [420]
The grotto answered in small gifts: a drop of water on my lip, a cooled gust, rested knees and clarity. [440]
In that clarity I saw how overlooked histories knot themselves into useful obscurity, protecting the vulnerable while embarrassing the proud. [460]
The people who fed larvae hid because authorities preferred straight lines, while life preferred meanders that saved breathing and possibility. [480]
I promised aloud to stitch their names from moss and echo, a record soft enough to pass inspection and rain. [500]
The monarch lifted, circled my signals, and appeared to bless the method: building temporary structures as signals mattered to survival. [520]
Not because they endure, but because they teach us to stand transiently rooted, to move without forsaking memory or responsibility. [540]
When a hawk shadow crossed, the cadence halted, a necessary interruption to mark danger, then resumed, altered yet legible again. [560]
I placed the wing where the wind would not tear it free, weighting the knot with a bead of resin. [580]
Then I lay on the moss, eyes open to green light, and waited for history to answer gently through stillness. [600]</story>
