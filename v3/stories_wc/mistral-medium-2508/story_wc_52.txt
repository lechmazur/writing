The widow of the lion tamer kept her tools under the rain-beaded skylight loft, where the light fractured like old glass. [22]

Every morning, while the kettle boiled below, she climbed the ladder with an ash wood carving blank cradled in her arms, its grain rough against her calloused palms. [45]

The loft smelled of damp cedar and the faint musk of sawdust, a scent that clung to her clothes like a second skin. [61]

She had been a seamstress once, before the lions, before the man who whispered to them—now she carved instead, her hands learning the language of absence. [85]

The first cut was always the hardest, the knife biting into the blank as if resisting the violation of its wholeness. [103]

But she pressed on, shaping the wood into the curve of a lion’s haunch, the dip of a spine, the quiet menace of a creature both here and gone. [123]

Her husband had died in the ring, not under claws but under the weight of his own stillness—one breath held too long, one heartbeat forgotten. [143]

The doctors called it a flaw in the blood; she called it the cost of standing too close to wild things. [158]

Each carving was an attempt to contain him, not as he was in death, but as he had been in the moment before the lions turned their heads toward the crowd. [183]

She worked through crystallized time, the minutes slowing as her fingers traced the memory of his voice, the way he’d laugh when the big cat licked his cheek like a house pet. [209]

The widow never wept. [212]

Tears were for the living, and she was already half-gone herself, her edges softened by the hauntingly practical rhythm of her days. [229]

She sold the carvings at the market, where tourists mistook her grief for artistry and paid in coins that jingled like hollow promises. [248]

One afternoon, a girl with ink-stained fingers asked why the lions always looked like they were stepping out of the wood, never fully there. [269]

The widow smoothed a thumb over the half-finished mane in her lap. [276]

“Because that’s how they are,” she said. “Here and gone.” [283]

The girl bought the piece anyway, tucking it into her satchel like a secret. [293]

That night, the widow dreamed of the circus tent collapsing inward, the lions dissolving into smoke, their roars echoing in the hollow of her ribs. [313]

She woke to the kettle’s whistle, the loft’s skylight streaked with the first gray of dawn. [324]

Her hands ached, but she reached for the ash blank again, because the alternative—stopping—was a kind of death too. [343]

She carved a lion mid-leap this time, its muscles coiled, its eyes fixed on something just beyond the wood’s edge. [362]

When she was done, she held it to the light, turning it until the rain on the glass painted stripes across its flank. [380]

For the first time, she didn’t take it to market. [386]

Instead, she placed it on the windowsill, where the morning sun caught the grain and made it glow like embers. [403]

The lion would stay. [406]

Not as a ghost, but as a lesson harvested from loss: that some things, no matter how fiercely you try to hold them, are only ever passing through. [426]

The widow descended the ladder, her footsteps steady on the worn rungs. [434]

Below, the kettle had gone cold, but she lit the stove anyway, the match striking with a sound like a lion’s yawn. [452]

She poured the water, the steam curling into the shape of things she would never name. [464]

Outside, the rain tapered off, leaving the skylight beaded with droplets that caught the light and scattered it across the floor in rust-hued peace. [483]

She sat at the table, her hands wrapped around the warm cup, and waited for the next blank to call her back upstairs. [505]

The lions in the wood would always be leaving. [511]

But she would be here, knife in hand, learning how to let them go. [522]

One cut at a time. [525] </story>
