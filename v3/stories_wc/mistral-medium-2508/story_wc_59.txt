The prince’s fingers trembled as they brushed the dust from the egg, its shell veined with cracks like forgotten rivers. [20]
It had been seventy years since the last sky-singer’s cry echoed through the stalactite canyons, and the suspended palace—anchored to the ceiling of the world by chains of black iron—had long since forgotten the sound of wings. [50]
Prince Aldric, his once-gilded robes now frayed and stiff with salt from the misting abyss below, had spent a decade assembling fragments of the past: broken lyres, yellowed scrolls of flight-paths, the hollow bones of birds that had once carried the sun’s fire in their throats. [90]
His advisors called it madness, but he called it *hypothesizing*—a method as precise as it was desperate, stitching guesswork to memory until something resembling truth took shape. [115]
This egg, unearthed from the palace’s lowest vault where the air tasted of rust and old sorrow, was his most fragile hypothesis yet. [135]

The chamber around him hummed with the mechanical sighs of the palace’s failing lungs—gears grinding, pipes wheezing steam, the whole structure groaning under the weight of its own stagnation. [155]
Aldric pressed his ear to the egg and listened, not for a heartbeat (he knew better than to hope for that), but for the *echo* of one, the ghost of what might have been if the world hadn’t chosen iron over feathers, industry over song. [180]
His motivation was simple, if absurd: to reawaken beauty in a world that had filed its edges smooth, that had traded the bitter-sweet ache of living for the numb efficiency of cogs and levers. [205]
The egg’s discovery had not been an accident, but a confession—hidden behind a loose stone in the wall, wrapped in a scrap of embroidery that bore his mother’s initials, the queen who’d whispered to sky-singers before the machines drowned her out. [235]

He assembled his tools with the reverence of a priest: a vial of warmed oil, a needle of spun glass, the last drop of liquid sunlight he’d siphoned from the palace’s dying gardens. [255]
The process was less science than sacrament, each step a question posed to the void: *What if the shell is not empty, but waiting?* [270]
*What if the flaw wasn’t in the bird, but in the world that couldn’t bear its song?* [280]
His hands shook harder as he pierced the egg’s membrane, not from fear, but from the quaking certainty that he was tampering with a genesis already doomed to fail. [300]

The first crack was a sound like a held breath breaking. [305]
Then came the scent—damp earth and something electric, the bitter-sweet tang of rot and renewal tangled together. [315]
Aldric recoiled as the egg *unfolded*, not hatching so much as *remembering* itself: veins of gold pulsed beneath translucent skin, and the thing inside stretched, its wings not feathers but shards of stained glass, catching the dim light and throwing fractured rainbows across the walls. [345]
It was not the sky-singer of legend. [350]
It was something *new*—a flawed genesis, born of loss and longing, its song not a melody but a grind of gears trying to mimic one. [365]

The palace shuddered. [367]
Chains groaned as the creature took its first, lurching flight, its wings scraping against the stalactites, sending shivers through the iron bones of the world. [380]
Aldric laughed, or perhaps he wept—the difference felt academic when the air itself was vibrating with the effort of something ugly trying to become beautiful. [400]
The advisors would call this a failure, another crack in the prince’s unraveling mind. [410]
But as the creature circled back, its glass wings refracting the palace’s dying light into something almost holy, Aldric knew: the flaw had never been in the attempt. [430]
It was in the expectation that beauty should be effortless, that rebirth shouldn’t taste of rust and salt and the bitter aftertaste of hope. [450]

Below them, the abyss yawned, hungry for failures. [455]
Above, the stalactites wept slow, mineral tears. [459]
And in the space between, the prince and his broken miracle hung suspended, not in defeat, but in the quaking reverie of a world learning to breathe again. [480]
