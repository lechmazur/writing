The sound wave garden hummed at the hush of the universe inhaling, its crystalline reeds bending under the weight of frequencies no human ear could catch. [25]

Lira perched on the edge of the auric lagoon, her bare feet dangling just above the water’s surface, where ripples shimmered with the ghostly afterglow of memories not her own. [50]

She was a guinea pig—no, a *subject*—of the experimental treatment, the one that wired strangers’ recollections into her synapses like stolen constellations. [75]

The doctors called it progress. [78]

She called it theft. [81]

Her fingers twitched, drumming a restless rhythm against the hollow metal rail beside her, each tap sending concentric rings across the lagoon’s surface. [100]

The water remembered. [103]

That was the problem. [106]

Every memory she absorbed bled into the garden, the reeds vibrating with the sorrow of a thousand half-lived moments: a child’s first betrayal, a lover’s last lie, the quiet panic of a mind unraveling. [130]

The treatment was supposed to heal. [134]

Instead, it made her a vault of auroral sorrow, her own thoughts drowned beneath the glow of others’ regrets. [145]

Tonight, she had stopped running. [149]

The universe held its breath, the stars above pulsing in time with the lagoon’s slow, liquid exhale. [160]

Lira pressed her palm to the water and let the memories rise—*not* to drown in them, but to shape them. [175]

She had spent months quietly rebellious, sabotaging the treatment in small ways: humming off-key during scans, drumming her fingers against the machines until their readings skewed. [195]

But this—this was different. [199]

The garden was a resonator, a place where sound could bend time, where the right frequency might untangle what the doctors had knotted. [215]

She began to sing. [218]

Not with her voice, but with her hands, slapping the water’s surface in a pattern only the reeds understood. [230]

The lagoon answered, its depths churning with gold and violet as the entangled memories surfaced like gasping fish. [245]

A woman’s laughter, thick with wine and warning. [251]

A man’s silence, heavier than the grave he’d dug for his own name. [259]

Lira’s breath came fast, her drumming frantic now, the garden trembling as the memories coiled around her wrists like vines. [275]

She wasn’t stealing them back. [279]

She was *releasing* them. [282]

The water hissed as the first memory broke free—a child’s sob, raw and red—and dissolved into the night. [295]

Then another. [297]

And another. [299]

The doctors would call this a relapse. [303]

She called it a birth. [306]

The lagoon’s surface froths with abandoned sorrow, the reeds keening as the last memory—a soldier’s final, whispered prayer—unspools into the dark. [325]

Lira’s hands stilled. [328]

The garden fell silent. [331]

For the first time in years, her mind was her own. [337]

She exhaled, slow and shaking, and the universe exhaled with her. [345]

The stars above fractured, their light spilling into the lagoon like shattered glass, and for a heartbeat, the water held the reflection of a sky that had never known grief. [365]

Then the reeds began to hum again, softer now, their song no longer a dirge but a lullaby. [378]

Lira smiled. [380]

The treatment had failed. [383]

The dream had not. [386]

She slipped into the lagoon, letting the water cradle her as the garden’s waves carried the last echoes of shared sorrow into the hush of the infinite. [405]

Somewhere, a memory stirred—*her* memory, bright and unbroken—and she reached for it, drumming her fingers against the current until the past and future collided in a single, perfect note. [430]

The doctors would never understand. [434]

They had tried to breathe life into a dream that was never theirs to shape. [442]

But dreams, like memories, were wild things. [447]

And wild things always found their way home. [452]

The lagoon’s glow faded as dawn crept over the garden’s edge, but Lira stayed, perched between the water and the sky, her heart finally quiet. [470]

The universe inhaled again. [474]

This time, she inhaled with it. [478]
