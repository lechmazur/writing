The jetty stretched like a broken rib from the land, its stones slick with twilight and the last gasps of the reef below. [20]

The coachman of Gloom Hill stood knee-deep in the tide, his boots caked with salt and the fine silt of drowned things. [34]
He was a gaunt figure, his face carved by years of squinting into the wind, his hands rough as the bark of the dead oaks that crowned the hill behind him. [54]
Those hands now cradled a collection of dried seed pods—blackened husks, brittle as old parchment, each one humming faintly when he pressed it to his ear. [74]
He spoke to them in a tongue no living soul knew, the syllables curling from his throat like smoke from damp kindling. [92]

The battlefield had been silent for decades, its furrows long filled with rain and the slow creep of moss. [105]
But the coachman remembered the screams, the way the earth had shuddered under cannon fire, how the very air had tasted of iron and gunpowder. [123]
Now, the land was hungry. [126]
Not for blood—it had feasted enough on that—but for roots, for the stubborn green fingers of things that grew despite the memory of death. [143]
He had spent years listening to the birds that wheeled over the jetty at dusk, their cries sharp as flint. [157]
They spoke of currents and storms, of fish silvering the depths where the reef had once teemed, now a graveyard of bleached coral. [174]
But beneath their warnings, he heard something else: a submerged concord, a pulse of life waiting to rise. [187]

Kneeling, he split a seed pod with his thumbnail, letting the dust inside drift onto the wet stone. [200]
The tide lapped at his fingers, eager to carry the offering into the cracks between the rocks. [212]
He did not pray—prayers were for those who still believed in mercy—but he whispered the old words anyway, the ones that made the wind stutter. [230]
*Grow*, he told the seeds. *Push through the rot. [236]
Make them forget what this place was.* [240]

A tern cried overhead, its wings cutting the bruised sky. [246]
The coachman answered in kind, mimicking the bird’s descent, the way it hovered before plunging. [257]
The birds knew where the soil was softest, where the bones of soldiers had dissolved into something fertile. [272]
He followed their calls, scattering the seed pods like promises. [279]

By the time the last light bled into the horizon, his pockets were empty. [288]
The jetty exhaled—a sigh of foam, of kelp uncurling from the stones. [298]
He did not stay to watch. [301]
The work was not in the seeing, but in the trusting: that the roots would find their way, that the blooms would come despite the salt, despite the weight of all that had sunk beneath. [325]

Back at Gloom Hill, the coachman lit a lamp and traced the map of the battlefield on his table. [338]
His fingers lingered on the places where the earth still wept, where the concords beneath the surface hummed loudest. [352]
Tomorrow, he would return. [355]
Tomorrow, he would bring the seeds that needed darkness to wake. [361]

Outside, the wind carried the scent of rain and the distant, insistent chatter of birds. [372]
They were calling him home. [375]
Not to the hill, not to the crumbling house where his ancestors had once hitched their horses, but to the jetty, to the slow, green vengeance of the earth. [396]
He slept poorly, dreaming of roots twisting through rifle barrels, of petals unfurling from the mouths of rusted helmets. [415]

When dawn came, he was already gone, his boots leaving no prints on the dew-slick grass. [428]
The battlefield would remember him, if only in the way the poppies leaned toward the sea, if only in the way the tide, at last, began to taste of something other than salt and sorrow. [450]

The coachman never spoke of what he did. [455]
There were no markers, no names carved into the wood of the new saplings. [465]
But the birds knew. [467]
And the land, after its long silence, knew too. [472]

Years later, fishermen would swear the jetty glowed at twilight, that the water there ran sweeter than elsewhere. [487]
They would blame the currents, or the ghosts of the reef, or the trick of the light. [498]
The coachman, by then, would be just another shadow on Gloom Hill, his bones as quiet as the seed pods he’d buried. [516]
But the garden would remain. [519]
And the garden would remember. [522]

It always did. [525] </story>
