The tide had stolen the friction from the world, leaving the bluff slick as a breath held too long. [16]
Liora crouched where the land met the water, her fingers tracing the damp sand for the hundredth time that night, searching for the pattern only she could see—because she *had* to see it. [40]
The aurora above pulsed like a dying heartbeat, its green and violet threads tangling with the memory of a promise her grandmother had whispered into her palm when she was seven: *"The dust remembers what the stars forget."* [72]
She was the last eel herder in the drowned valleys, a title that meant nothing now that the eels had vanished into the frictionless deep, their silver bodies slipping through her nets like smoke. [105]
But the dust remained. [108]
Collapsed star dust, fine as regret, collected in the crevices of the bluff where the tide couldn’t reach. [120]
Liora’s curse was knowing—*always knowing*—the moment before something shifted: the eel’s flick before it vanished, the aurora’s flare before it dimmed, the way her mother’s voice had cracked just before she walked into the sea. [150]
It was why she placed the painted rocks now, arranging them in spirals and fractals along the tideline, their colors leached pale by the borrowed dawn. [172]
The sequences were sacred, or so the old texts claimed, though no one else could read them. [183]
She pressed a blue-streaked stone into the sand, her breath fogging in the cold, and the world *tilted*—just for a heartbeat—as if the earth itself recognized the pattern. [205]
The dust at her feet shivered. [208]
Liora exhaled, slow and deliberate, and reached for it. [213]
The grains were heavier than they should’ve been, warm as a pulse, and when she closed her fist, the aurora above *snapped* into a perfect ring, its light threading through her bones. [233]
A voice, not her grandmother’s but something older, hummed against her ribs: *"Harness it, or it will unmake you."* [246]
She didn’t know what "it" was. [249]
The rocks trembled in their sequences, their paint flaking like dead skin, and the water at the bluff’s edge began to *rise*, not with the tide but with intention, forming a mirror so still it could’ve been glass. [275]
Liora saw herself in it—then saw herself *unraveling*, her edges fraying into the reflected sky. [286]
The promise wasn’t about the eels. [290]
It was about the dust. [292]
About the moment after friction disappeared, when the world became a place where patterns could be *rewritten*. [304]
Her hands moved without thought, weaving the dust into the gaps between the rocks, her fingers bleeding where the grains bit too deep. [320]
The sequences *glowed*. [322]
The aurora above fractured into a thousand needle-thin lines, each one connecting to a stone, and Liora understood: the sacred patterns weren’t maps. [339]
They were *anchors*. [341]
Something had been waiting for the friction to vanish. [346]
Something that wanted the promises broken. [349]
She pressed her palms to the sand, the dust burning through her skin, and *pushed*. [358]
The bluff groaned. [360]
The mirror-water shattered. [362]
And the eels returned—not as silver ghosts, but as they’d been in the stories, their bodies etched with the same spirals as her rocks, their eyes holding the collapsed light of dead stars. [385]
They coiled around her wrists, their touch searing, and Liora *knew*: the promise had never been to her. [400]
She was just the one cursed to keep it. [404]
The dawn broke, stolen and fragile, painting the tide in colors that didn’t exist before. [414]
Liora stood, the eels slipping back into the frictionless deep, the dust settled into her bones. [425]
The rocks remained, their sequences perfect. [429]
She would place more tomorrow. [432]
And the next day. [434]
Until the patterns held. [436]
Until the promise did not linger, but *slept*. [441]
The aurora dimmed to embers. [444]
The tide crept higher. [446]
And Liora, the last eel herder, began to walk the bluff again, her footsteps the only friction left in the world. [460]
