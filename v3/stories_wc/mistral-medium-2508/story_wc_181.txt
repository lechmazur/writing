The curator’s fingers trembled as they brushed dust from the pistachio shell cameo blank, its surface etched with spirals that shouldn’t exist. [20]

It had arrived in the museum’s backlog with no provenance, just a note: *"For the one who asks."* [32]

The astral orchard outside the asteroid’s observation dome pulsed with violet blossoms, their petals unfolding in fractal patterns—each bloom a silent argument against linear time. [50]

The curator, a woman whose name had been filed away in some bureaucrat’s ledger as *"Dr. Veyra (Unassigned Specialization),"* had spent seventeen years cataloging artifacts that defied taxonomy. [70]

This one defied *her*. [73]

She carried the cameo into the bathroom—where the acoustics were best for thinking—and locked the door. [83]

The stall’s graffiti (*"The past is a palimpsest; scratch deep enough"* scrawled in what looked like dried sap) seemed to wink at her. [96]

Veyra pressed the cameo to her temple. [99]

A memory that wasn’t hers unspooled: a child on a planet that no longer existed, whispering to a tree as its roots rewrote the soil’s history. [114]

*"Nonlinear inheritance,"* she murmured. [117]

The concept slotted into her mind like a key. [121]

Not genetics. Not culture. [123]

Something older—knowledge passed not through blood or text, but by *resonance*, by objects that remembered how to be held. [135]

The cameo hummed against her skin. [138]

Veyra splashed water on her face. [141]

In the mirror, her reflection blinked half a second after she did. [147]

*"You’re inquiring,"* the reflection said, voice layered with static. *"That’s dangerous."* [155]

The curator laughed, sharp and bright. [158]

Danger was the point. [160]

She’d spent her life surrounded by forbidden knowledge, but this—this was the first thing that had ever *asked* to be known. [172]

The orchard’s blossoms pressed against the dome, their pollen tracing equations in the air. [180]

One petal detached, drifted through the vent, and landed in Veyra’s palm. [187]

It dissolved into ink. [189]

She read the symbols before they faded: *"Turn the cameo over."* [195]

The reverse side was smooth, save for a single word engraved in a script that hurt to look at: **"Simply."** [108]

Veyra’s breath hitched. [211]

The cameo wasn’t an artifact. [214]

It was an invitation. [216]

She tucked it into her pocket and stepped into the orchard, where the trees grew in the shape of questions. [226]

The first blossom she touched showed her the museum burning. [232]

The second showed her the curator who’d come before her—same bewildered eyes, same hunger—holding the same cameo. [243]

The third showed her the asteroid *before* the orchard, when it had been a prison for something that thought in probabilities. [255]

*"You’re not the first to inquire,"* the wind sighed. *"You won’t be the last."* [264]

Veyra sat beneath a tree whose roots pulsed with light. [269]

The cameo grew warm. [271]

*"What do you want?"* she asked. [274]

The answer came not in words, but in the sudden understanding that the orchard was a library, the blossoms its pages, and the cameo her membership card. [288]

The knowledge here wasn’t forbidden. [291]

It was *protected*. [293]

From people who would weaponize it. [295]

From people who would worship it. [297]

From people who, like her, would drown in it. [300]

Veyra exhaled. [302]

The curator before her had tried to document everything. [306]

The one before *that* had tried to destroy it. [309]

She would do neither. [311]

Instead, she plucked a single blossom—the one that smelled like pistachio shells—and pressed it into the cameo’s hollow. [322]

The engraving changed. [324]

**"Complicated,"** it now read. [326]

The orchard shivered. [328]

A door appeared between two trees, its frame carved with warnings in every language that had ever been spoken. [339]

Veyra stepped through. [341]

On the other side, the museum was intact, her desk untouched. [347]

The cameo lay in the backlog tray, pristine. [351]

The note now read: *"For the next one who asks."* [357]

Veyra smiled. [359]

She picked up her pen, dipped it in ink that smelled faintly of violet sap, and began the first entry in a new catalog: *"Item #N-0: A key that unlocks only when held by someone who understands they shouldn’t turn it."* [385]

Outside, the orchard bloomed in silent approval. [390]

Somewhere, between the first and last page of a book no one would ever finish, a tree grew a single pistachio. [403]

Veyra ate it. [405]

The shell, when she split it open, was etched with her own face. [412]

She tucked it into her pocket and went back to work. [418]
