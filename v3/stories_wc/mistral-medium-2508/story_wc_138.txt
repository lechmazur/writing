The prismatic escondite hummed like a struck bell, its walls shifting between violet and bruise-blue as the solar storm outside bent light into knives. [24]

Lysander—who had been alive so long he remembered the first time stars learned to die—leaned against a pillar of fractal ice, tracing the seams where dimensions bled into one another. [48]

Boredom was a luxury for mortals; for him, it was a slow poison, seeping into the marrow of his infinite years. [65]

He had come here, to this pocket of warped space, because the escondite was the only place where the rules of physics still felt like a game worth playing. [87]

His fingers brushed the amulet fragment in his coat—a jagged sliver of black glass, veined with copper, that pulsed in time with the storm’s magnetic surges. [109]

It was cursed, of course. [112]

Not in the petty way of ghosts or vengeful lovers, but in the way of geometry gone feral: it didn’t just *exist* in space, it *argued* with it. [130]

Lysander had stolen it from a dying architect of the fourth dimension, who’d whispered, *“It wants to know what happens when you let go.”* [151]

He turned the fragment over. [154]

The escondite’s gravity flickered, and for a heartbeat, the floor became the ceiling became a memory of a place that had never been. [173]

Spatial mutiny. [175]

That’s what the scholars called it when a location rebelled against its own coordinates, when up and down and *through* became suggestions rather than laws. [195]

Lysander smiled. [197]

He had spent centuries watching civilizations crumble under the weight of their own certainties; this, at least, was a rebellion he could respect. [218]

The storm outside howled, and the amulet’s copper veins glowed hot against his palm. [230]

Magnetic fields were the escondite’s language, the way it whispered to objects that listened—like the fragment, like him. [246]

He pressed it to the ice pillar. [250]

A crack split the air, not a sound but a *concept*, the noise of a dimension realizing it had been lied to. [265]

The escondite shuddered. [267]

Walls peeled back like petals, revealing a corridor that shouldn’t have existed, its depths swirling with colors that had no names. [283]

Lysander stepped forward. [286]

The amulet was warm now, almost alive, its curse not malice but *curiosity*—it wanted to see what happened when a bored immortal and a hungry void compared notes on goodbyes. [312]

He had spent lifetimes leaving things behind: lovers, kingdoms, versions of himself that no longer fit. [327]

But he had never truly *let go*. [331]

The corridor breathed. [333]

Its magnetic pull tugged at his bones, not to harm him, but to *unmake* the idea of harm entirely. [346]

Lysander exhaled. [348]

“Alright,” he murmured, and dropped the fragment. [353]

It didn’t fall. [355]

It *expanded*, the curse blooming outward like a time-lapse of decay, rewriting the escondite’s geometry into something fluid, something *kind*. [373]

The walls dissolved into a sky that was also a sea that was also the space between breaths. [385]

Lysander floated, weightless, dimensionally aware in a way that had nothing to do with sight or sound—it was the awareness of a man realizing he had been holding his breath for millennia. [408]

The storm outside stuttered, then stilled. [413]

The escondite wasn’t a place anymore. [417]

It was a question. [419]

And for the first time in forever, Lysander didn’t have an answer. [426]

He laughed, the sound rippling through the new-made void like a stone skipped across infinity. [438]

The amulet’s curse had been a door, not a trap. [444]

Goodbye wasn’t an ending. [447]

It was the first honest thing he’d ever said. [452]

The void whispered back. [455]

Its voice was the hushed thunder of a universe leaning in to hear the punchline. [464]

Lysander closed his eyes. [467]

When he opened them, he was somewhere else. [471]

(Or maybe he was everywhere. [474]

Or maybe the difference no longer mattered.) [478]

The amulet fragment was gone. [481]

In its place, resting on his palm, was a single copper vein—thrumming, alive, humming the same note as the escondite’s last breath. [499]

Lysander tucked it into his coat. [503]

Somewhere, a solar storm was ending. [507]

Somewhere, a new one was beginning. [511]

He walked forward, and the void walked with him. [517]
