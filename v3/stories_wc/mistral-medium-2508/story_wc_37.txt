The greenhouse hummed with the breath of unseen roots, its glass panes fogged by the exhalations of a realm that had forgotten how to wake. [20]

Liora moved between the rows of silver-leafed trees, her fingers brushing the mica windows set into their bark—thin, translucent sheets that trapped fragments of light like half-remembered dreams. [45]

She was the last memory keeper, though the title meant little now that the songs had gone silent. [58]

The orchard had once been a cradle, where dawns were woven from the voices of those who tended it, their harmonies spinning gold into the air like thread. [78]

But the mirror world had turned greedy, swallowing whole the melodies that bound its communities together, leaving only hollow echoes in the endless night. [98]

Liora pressed her palm to a mica window and felt the faint pulse of a trapped sunrise, its warmth dull as an ember smothered in ash. [116]

She had spent decades gathering these shards—not just light, but the laughter of children who’d played beneath these boughs, the arguments of lovers now dust, the last gasp of a blacksmith who’d forged hinges for doors that no longer existed. [143]

The alchemical trees shivered, their branches heavy with fruit that never ripened, each one a promise deferred. [158]

She knew the method, though it terrified her: to swaddle the dying realm in forgotten songs, to wrap its wounds in the very fabric of what it had lost. [178]

The first note would be the hardest. [182]

Liora knelt and dug her nails into the soil until her fingers bled, the pain sharp enough to dredge up a fragment—a woman’s voice, humming as she braided her daughter’s hair by candlelight. [205]

The memory unfurled like smoke, curling around the mica windows, and for a breath, the greenhouse trembled. [219]

A single silver leaf quivered, then split open, revealing a vein of gold. [230]

The trees leaned in, hungry. [233]

She sang louder, the words strange in her throat, the syllables pulling at something deep in the earth. [246]

The mirror world had always been a reflection, but now it was a prison, its surfaces slick with the weight of all it had absorbed. [263]

Liora’s voice cracked, and the mica windows flickered—one, then another—like eyes blinking against the dark. [277]

She remembered the festivals, when the air had been thick with the scent of crushed petals and the press of bodies moving as one, their breath synchronizing into something greater. [300]

That was the attribute she sought: the knitting, the binding, the way a community could become a single heartbeat if it chose to. [316]

The trees groaned, their bark splitting as light seeped through the fissures, pale and trembling. [329]

Liora’s throat burned, but she didn’t stop. [334]

She sang of the baker who’d fed strangers during the long frost, of the child who’d carried water to the thirsty roots when the rivers ran black. [356]

The greenhouse shuddered, the endless night outside pressing in like a held breath. [367]

Then—a sound. [369]

Not from her. [371]

A thread of harmony, thin as spider silk, wound through her song, strengthening it. [380]

Liora’s eyes flew open. [383]

The mica windows were glowing now, not with trapped light, but with something alive, something *returning*. [396]

The mirror world had begun to sing back. [401]

The trees shuddered again, and this time, their branches did not sag—they rose, weaving together above her head, their leaves catching the burgeoning dawn like a net. [423]

Liora fell to her knees as the first true light in centuries spilled through the greenhouse, golden and raw. [438]

It wasn’t just the realm that had been dying. [443]

It was her. [445]

And now, at last, she was being released. [449]

The light swaddled her, not as an end, but as a beginning—the first stitch in a tapestry that would take a thousand voices to complete. [468]

Outside, the endless night screamed as it unraveled, but inside the greenhouse, the alchemical orchard bloomed, its fruit heavy with the weight of dawns yet to be woven. [490]

Liora smiled. [492]

The work was not hers alone anymore. [496]

The memory keeper had become the song, and the song had become the world. [508]

When the first villagers stumbled through the greenhouse doors, blinking in the unfamiliar light, they found her standing among the trees, her hands outstretched, her throat still vibrating with the last note. [535]

They didn’t ask what had happened. [539]

They knew. [541]

One by one, they joined their voices to hers, and the mica windows shattered—not from force, but from fulfillment. [558]

The shards dissolved into the air like sugar in tea, sweetening the dawn. [567]

The mirror world sighed, its hunger finally sated, its reflection no longer a cage but a door. [580]

Liora closed her eyes and let the harmony carry her, knowing that this time, the light would not be trapped. [600]

It would be passed. [603]

And the weaving would never stop. [607]
