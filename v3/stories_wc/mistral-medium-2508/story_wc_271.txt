The wind off the cliffs carried salt and the ghost of foghorns, though the last lighthouse keeper had left decades ago. [18]

Lena traced the edge of the arboretum’s stone wall, her fingers rough from years of pruning fig trees that no longer bore fruit. [33]

She had been quietly talented once—before the drone strike turned her sister’s wedding into a crater, before the photograph in her pocket crumpled further with each clench of her fist. [58]

The arboretum was her refuge, a pearl of stillness where the world’s noise dissolved into the rustle of olive leaves and the slow pulse of tide against rock. [79]

She had come here to freeze time, not in memory, but in the body: her breath held for seven heartbeats, her shoulders locked like the roots of the ancient cypress anchoring the cliffside. [103]

The method was somatic, a trick learned from a trauma therapist who called it *embodied pause*—press your palms into your thighs until the sting overrides the echo of screams. [128]

Today, the freeze came easier. [132]

A tour group wandered the paths below, their voices bright with the kind of optimism that only exists in places untouched by war. [147]

Lena wanted to hate them. [150]

Instead, she pulled the crumpled photograph from her pocket—a snapshot of her sister laughing, henna still wet on her hands, the drone a speck in the sky no one had noticed yet. [170]

She smoothed it against the cypress bark, the paper fibrous with creases, the image softening at the edges like a dream half-remembered. [187]

The therapist had said, *You don’t have to let go. [193]*
*You have to make room.* [195]

Lena exhaled, slow, and let the wind take the photograph. [201]

It fluttered once, twice, then caught on a low branch, suspended between earth and sea. [209]

A child from the tour group pointed. [212]

“Look, a bird!” he shouted, squinting at the white square against the green. [220]

His mother laughed. [222]

Lena didn’t correct them. [225]

She pressed her palms harder into her thighs, the pain sharp and clean, and for the first time in years, she let herself imagine a future where the weight in her chest wasn’t grief, but something heavier—something like roots. [252]

The arboretum had been here before the lighthouse, before the drones, before her. [262]

It would be here after. [265]

That was the realism she could anchor to: not the erasure of loss, but the stubborn persistence of life, even on the edge of a cliff, even when the wind howled like a warning. [286]

She turned toward the sea. [289]

The tide was coming in. [292]

Below, the tour group moved on, their laughter fading like the foghorns, like the drone’s hum in the split second before impact. [310]

Lena reached for the lowest branch of the cypress, the one that had caught the photograph, and plucked a single leaf. [323]

She rolled it between her fingers until its oils perfumed the air, citrus and resin, the scent of something alive. [336]

This, too, was a kind of freeze—not of time, but of attention, a stillness that held both the past and the possible. [352]

The leaf’s veins mirrored the cracks in the stone wall, the fractures in her own ribs, the fault lines of a world that broke and kept breathing anyway. [371]

She tucked the leaf into her pocket, beside the empty space where the photograph had been. [382]

Optimism wasn’t the belief that pain wouldn’t return. [387]

It was the quiet talent of meeting it without flinching, of saying, *I am still here. [398]*
*And so are you.* [400]

The cypress swayed. [402]

The sea answered. [404]

Lena walked back to the fig trees, her hands steady, her breath even, the arboretum humming around her like a second pulse. [420]

She would prune the deadwood today. [424]

She would leave the rest to grow. [427]
