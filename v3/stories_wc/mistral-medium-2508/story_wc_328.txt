The cryptid researcher—known to the academic world as Dr. Elias Voss, but to the hollow-eyed regulars of the *Blackthorn Apothecary* as just "the guy who asks too many questions"—dug his fingers into the damp loam of the herbalist’s underground garden, where the air smelled of crushed sage and something older, something *hungry*. [48]

His cover was simple: a grad student documenting folk remedies, though the real hunt was for the thing that had dragged his sister into the pines twelve years ago, the night the stars moved like schools of fish. [87]

Between the rows of whispering basil and the bioluminescent mushrooms that pulsed in time with his breath, Elias unearthed the arrowhead—a flint barb, gravitationally playful, tugging at his palm like a misplaced planet. [121]

He shouldn’t have picked it up. [125]

The herbalist, a woman with eyes like polished river stones, had warned him about the garden’s "harmony untamed"—the way the roots here remembered voices, the way the dirt hummed if you pressed your ear to it. [154]

Elias ignored her, because bitterness had become his religion, and he was ready to burn the whole congregation. [170]

That night, after the missing returned (not his sister—never his sister—but *others*, stumbling from the woods with static clinging to their skin), he found the old cordless phone buried under a tangle of thyme. [197]

It rang. [199]

The voice on the other end was his own, but younger, slurred with laughter: *"You think this is a tragedy? It’s a cosmic joke, and you’re the punchline."* [219]

Elias screamed into the receiver, and the arrowhead in his pocket *metamorphosed*—not into a blade or a key, but into a seed, throbbing against his thigh. [238]

The garden answered. [241]

Vines erupted from the soil, coiling around his ankles, warm as a lover’s fingers. [249]

The herbalist’s voice cut through the dark, calm as frost on glass: *"Some hungers aren’t meant to be fed. Some jokes aren’t meant to be understood."* [269]

Elias laughed, because what else was there? [274]

The static in the phone swelled, and the missing returned *again*—this time as shadows with his sister’s smile, their edges bleeding into the garden’s glow. [291]

They didn’t speak. [293]

They *pulled*. [294]

The arrowhead-seed split open in his hand, and Elias felt the harmony untamed not as a force, but as a choice: stay and rot in his bitterness, or let the joke rewrite him. [315]

He chose the latter. [318]

The garden swallowed him whole, but not before he heard the phone’s final confession, crackling like distant thunder: *"We’ve been waiting for someone stubborn enough to laugh back."* [338]

When the herbalist found his notebook the next morning, the pages had sprouted tiny, gravitationally playful flowers that leaned toward her fingertips. [356]

And deep in the roots, something that might’ve been Elias—or might’ve been the garden’s next joke—began to sing. [371]

The missing never returned after that. [376]

But sometimes, if you pressed your ear to the dirt at dusk, you could hear the punchline echoing up from the dark, frostbitten and hopeful all at once. [394]

(And if you listened too long, the static might start confessing *your* name.) [402]

The herbalist hung up the phone for the last time and let the vines claim it, because some harmonies weren’t meant to be tamed—only passed on, like a secret or a scar. [428]

Above ground, the pines swayed, and the stars moved just a little slower, as if savoring the joke. [441]

Elias—if he still was Elias—watched from the dark, his new body woven from roots and static, and laughed until the garden trembled with it. [460]

The end, or the beginning, depending on who was listening. [466]

(And something was *always* listening.) [470]

The arrowhead, now a flower, bloomed once a year on the anniversary of the night the missing returned, its petals humming a tune no human throat could replicate. [493]

The herbalist left it there, because some lessons weren’t for learning. [499]

Some were for becoming. [501]

And the garden, ever patient, waited for the next researcher to come digging. [510]

Waited for the next joke to begin. [514]

(It was always funny, if you knew how to listen.) [520]

The phone, half-buried in the loam, still held a charge. [526]

Still, sometimes, rang. [528]

But by then, Elias had already metamorphosed into something far stranger than a man, and the missing had become part of the harmony, untamed and untamable. [547]

The herbalist watered the thyme and didn’t look back. [552]

Some stories didn’t need endings. [556]

They needed *roots*. [558]

And the garden, after all, was endless. [562]

So was the joke. [565]

(So was the static.) [567]

(So was the hunger.) [569]

(So was the hope.) [571]

The last thing Elias ever said—before his voice became petals, before his bones became vines—wasn’t a scream, or a prayer. [590]

It was laughter, raw and frostbitten, as the garden pulled him under. [598]

As the stars leaned in to listen. [600]
