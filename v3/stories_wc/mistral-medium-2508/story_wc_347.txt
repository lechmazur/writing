The orchard had been Liora’s burden for thirteen years, ever since the last caretaker vanished into the labyrinth’s stone throat and left her with a key, a warning, and a grove of trees that bore fruit no one dared eat. [37]

The fruit was beautiful—plump, deep violet things that glistened like oil on water—but the first bite stole memories, the second stole breath, and the third stole you entirely. [59]

She knew this because she’d watched it happen. [65]

The blueprint had been tucked beneath the floorboards of the caretaker’s hut, its edges frayed, its ink the color of old bruises. [80]

Liora had found it by accident, prying up a loose plank to hide the last of her mother’s letters, and there it was: a schematic of the labyrinth, its paths overlaid with something else—gears, pulleys, a system of weights designed to shift the stone when triggered just so. [112]

The mechanical birds came at dusk, their brass wings whirring as they patrolled the cliffside, their glass eyes reflecting the dying light. [128]

They were supposed to keep people out. [132]

Liora had spent years learning their routes, their blind spots, the exact moment their joints stiffened before the night frost set in. [147]

She wasn’t supposed to guide travelers. [152]

But the girl had been half-dead when she stumbled into the orchard, her boots cracked with ice, her lips blue. [164]

“Please,” the girl had whispered, and Liora—who had spent a lifetime refusing pleas—had found herself pressing a small nut into the girl’s palm. [180]

“Follow the impressions,” she’d said, too sharp, too precise. [187]

The nut was from the safe tree, the one that didn’t steal, its shell carved with a pattern only Liora could read. [202]

She’d spent years leaving them along the labyrinth’s edges, pressing them into the dirt just hard enough to leave a mark, never touching the stone itself. [221]

The travelers who found them never saw her. [226]

They only saw the path—indents in the earth, offhandedly exact, leading them to the hidden crevice where the cliff gave way to a descent, where the mechanical birds couldn’t follow. [246]

The blueprint had shown her how. [250]

The system was old, older than the curse, older than the orchard. [258]

Someone had built the labyrinth to guide, not to trap. [264]

But the gears had jammed, the weights had rusted, and the paths had become a maze. [274]

Liora had spent years assembling the pieces in her mind, turning the blueprint over in her hands like a puzzle she couldn’t solve. [289]

Until the girl. [291]

Now she stood at the orchard’s edge, watching the last of the sunlight catch on the mechanical birds’ wings, their shadows stretching long across the stone. [309]

The night frost would come soon. [313]

She reached into her pocket and pulled out the last nut, its shell warm from her fingers. [322]

This one she wouldn’t leave. [325]

She knelt, pressing it into the dirt at the entrance of the labyrinth, just hard enough to leave an impression. [338]

Then she turned and walked back into the orchard, where the cursed trees swayed in the wind, their branches heavy with forgotten fruit. [354]

Somewhere below, the girl would be following the path, her footsteps light, her breath steady. [366]

Liora didn’t look back. [369]

The blueprint had been a guide once. [373]

Maybe, if she kept leaving impressions, the labyrinth would remember how to lead people home. [384]

The first frost settled as she reached the hut, its silver fingers creeping over the wood, the stone, the fruit that no one would ever eat. [402]

Inside, she lit a lamp, its flame flickering against the walls, against the blueprint pinned above her cot. [416]

She traced the lines with her eyes, memorizing the angles, the weights, the way the gears were meant to turn. [430]

One day, she would fix it. [434]

One day, the labyrinth would open like a door. [439]

Until then, she would keep leaving nuts in the dirt, small and precise, a trail of graceless beauty for those who needed it most. [457]

Outside, the mechanical birds fell still, their wings locked in place by the cold. [467]

The night held its breath. [470]

And somewhere, far below, a traveler walked free. [475]
