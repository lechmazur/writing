The glass spire hummed under Li Wei’s fingertips as he pressed a fresh strip of rice paper against its curved wall, the ink still damp with prophecy. [20]

Outside, the frozen lake stretched like a cracked mirror, its surface splitting the dawn into jagged reflections—a horizon that refused to stay still. [38]

He had been writing fortunes for thirty-seven years, each one a whisper meant to unravel in steam and soy sauce, but this morning’s batch clung to him like a second skin. [58]

*"You will hear the song before the silence,"* he had scribbled at 3:17 AM, the hour his mother used to wake for her shift at the textile mill, her hands raw from threading needles by kerosene light. [83]

Li Wei’s own hands ached now, not from labor but from the weight of what he hadn’t yet written. [95]

On the windowsill, a segment of nautilus shell caught the pale light, its chambers spiraling inward like the floorplan of a home he couldn’t return to—each ridge a year, each hollow the echo of a door left unopened. [120]

He turned the shell in his palm, tracing the fracture where it had broken during the move to this spire, this place where the air tasted of ice and old electricity. [140]

The city below had hired him to be its oracle, though no one admitted it; they only nodded when his fortunes came true, as if precision were luck and not the act of a man mapping his childhood onto the bones of strangers. [165]

*"The conductor of unheard symphonies,"* his father had called him once, drunk on baijiu, slurring through the story of how Li Wei had, at six, arranged the neighborhood cats by meow-pitch on the rooftop. [188]

That was before the reservoirs drowned the village, before the government paid in yuan and relocation papers, before Li Wei learned that homesickness wasn’t a place but a *when*. [210]

He missed the sound of his mother’s sewing machine at dawn, the rhythmic *chuk-chuk-chuk* that had scored his dreams like a metronome. [225]

Now, the spire’s glass amplified every sigh, every creak of the floorboards, until his own breath felt like an intrusion. [239]

The lake’s mirrored horizon wavered as the sun climbed, the ice groaning under the shift—an overture, he thought, to something he was meant to direct. [256]

Li Wei dipped his brush again, this time pressing harder, the ink bleeding into the shape of a treble clef. [266]

*"The silence is not empty,"* he wrote. *"It is waiting for you to fill it."* [276]

His fingers trembled. [278]

The shell’s fracture aligned with the first light, casting a hairline shadow across the paper—a seam, a pause, the space between notes where the music lived. [295]

He remembered the last time he’d stood by water at dawn: his father’s fishing boat, the oars dripping, the way the mist had curled like sheet music over the river. [313]

That was the morning his father had handed him the nautilus shell, still warm from his pocket. *"Listen,"* he’d said. [324]

Li Wei had pressed it to his ear and heard nothing, but now he understood: the shell wasn’t for hearing. [335]

It was for *holding*. [337]

The spire’s intercom crackled—a delivery courier, early, impatient. [343]

Li Wei tucked the shell into his sleeve, the fortune into an envelope, and stepped onto the balcony where the cold bit clean, like the first note of a scale. [358]

Below, the lake’s mirror had splintered further, each shard refracting a different hour: the golden smear of his fifth birthday, the gray slush of the day his mother’s hands stopped moving. [380]

He inhaled. [381]

The courier’s knock echoed up the spire, but Li Wei stayed, watching the horizon unzip itself from the dark, the ice singing as it split. [396]

Somewhere in the fracture, a sound emerged—not a memory, not a fortune, but the hum of a string plucked just before the music begins. [414]

He smiled. [415]

The courier would wait. [417]

The city would read its fortunes and nod. [420]

And Li Wei? [422]

He would finally conduct. [424]

His hands rose, not to write, but to shape the air between the spire and the sky, where the dawn hung like a breath held before the first, true note. [440]

The ice groaned again. [442]

The horizon trembled. [444]

Li Wei closed his eyes and began. [447]
