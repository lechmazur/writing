The harmonic stone skimmer crouched atop the highest rib of the bone towers, his fingers tracing the edge of the stone arrowhead pressed to his chest. [22]

For centuries, the canyon had swallowed echoes whole, its walls carved by time into jagged spires that hummed when the wind slithered through their hollows. [40]

He had come here not to climb, but to listen—to learn the old way, the way his ancestors had before the dust settled in layers thick as memory. [62]

The arrowhead was the last relic of his lineage, its edges worn smooth by generations of palms that had gripped it while deciphering the sky’s language. [85]

Below, the flock shifted, a living map of black wings against the bruised twilight. [95]

The skimmer exhaled, slow and measured, and began to appraise their patterns—not with eyes, but with the resonance of the stone against his sternum, feeling the vibrations of their flight like ripples in still water. [120]

His people had once navigated entire lives without moving, reading the pulse of the world in the drift of birds, the sigh of sand, the shudder of bone. [140]

But he was the last who remembered how. [145]

The flock banked sharply, a sudden unison that sent a tremor through the arrowhead, and the skimmer’s breath hitched. [158]

There—an anomaly. [160]

A single bird lagged, its wings beating out of sync, dragging the formation’s harmony into discord. [172]

His fingers tightened. [174]

Centuries of dust had taught him this: a pulse left wandering was never an accident. [184]

The canyon’s echoes twisted the sound, but he heard it anyway—the faint, wrong note threading through the wind. [198]

Something was hunting. [200]

The skimmer pressed the arrowhead harder, letting its weight anchor him as the flock scattered, their panic a storm of erratic vibrations. [219]

He didn’t need to see the predator to know its shape—old stories spoke of things that moved like hunger, that fed on the lost pulses of the unguided. [239]

His ancestors had called them the Hollow Maws. [244]

The bone towers groaned as the wind shifted, their echoes curling around him like a warning. [256]

He had spent a lifetime learning to navigate without moving, but now, for the first time, he understood why: movement was a confession. [275]

Stillness was survival. [277]

The lagging bird fell. [279]

The skimmer didn’t watch it drop. [281]

Instead, he turned the arrowhead in his palm, its edge catching the last of the light, and whispered the old words his grandmother had taught him—the ones that bound a pulse to stone. [304]

The canyon held its breath. [307]

Then, the echo came—not from the walls, but from the arrowhead itself, a low, resonant thrum that matched the rhythm of his own heartbeat. [326]

The Hollow Maw would hear it. [329]

It would come. [331]

And when it did, it would find not a man, but a tower—a pulse carved into bone, unyielding, historically reverent. [347]

The skimmer closed his eyes. [350]

He didn’t need to see to know the flock had reformed, their wings now a seamless weave, their path unbroken. [365]

The arrowhead grew warm against his skin, its vibrations steady, sure. [373]

He had learned, at last, to navigate without moving—not by fleeing the pulse, but by becoming its anchor. [387]

The wind howled, but the bone towers stood firm, their echoes no longer endless, but deliberate. [401]

A shadow blotted the twilight. [404]

The skimmer didn’t flinch. [406]

He was the stone. [408]

He was the echo. [410]

And the canyon, for the first time in centuries, fell silent. [418]

The Hollow Maw passed beneath him, a ripple of wrongness sliding through the dust, its hunger unmet. [432]

When it was gone, the skimmer exhaled, the arrowhead cool once more in his grip. [442]

The flock spiraled upward, their wings brushing the stars, their pattern perfect. [452]

He had done what his ancestors could not—he had let the pulse wander, and then he had called it home. [470]

The canyon’s echoes returned, softer now, as if the bone itself had learned to listen. [483]

The skimmer tucked the arrowhead into his robe, its weight familiar, its silence a promise. [496]

He would stay until the next wandering pulse. [501]

He would stay until the dust remembered his name. [507]

And when the time came, he would teach the towers to sing. [515]

Until then, he waited—still as stone, resolute as wind, a man who had learned to move without moving at all. [535]

The stars blinked above him, indifferent and endless. [540]

The canyon breathed. [542]

And the harmonic stone skimmer listened. [546]
