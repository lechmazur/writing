The sculptor’s hands remembered the marsh reeds before her mind did—how they bent but never broke, how their hollow stems whispered when the wind passed through. [30]

She worked now in a crystalline orchard, its trees grown from the slow pressure of time and memory, their branches heavy with fruit that refracts light into stories no one alive could read. [60]

At the orchard’s edge yawned the Shimmer Crater, a wound in the earth where the air hummed with the murmur of lost languages, syllables dissolving before they could form meaning. [90]

The villagers called her *Reed* because she had arrived with nothing but a bundle of dried stalks and a knife, because she carved kin from what others discarded. [119]

Her latest piece—the arbor—was obsidian, its surface rippling with trapped starlight, a thing too sharp to touch but too beautiful to ignore. [138]

She had built it for the festival of grafting, where the village would weave new names into the old, where strangers became kin through shared labor and witness. [160]

But the arbor was incomplete. [163]

It needed a dedication, something bold enough to hold the weight of belonging. [171]

That was when she found the tag—sprayed onto the crater’s rim in luminous violet: *I was here, and so were you.* [187]

The street artist, *Syl*, was a ghost story the village told in hushed tones: a wanderer who left marks like breadcrumbs, who painted kinship where none had been before. [209]

Reed traced the letters with her fingertips, the paint still faintly warm, as if the artist had only just stepped away. [226]

She decided then to find Syl, not for answers, but for the search itself—a way to bind the village together in the looking. [243]

The elders warned her. "Syl doesn’t want to be found," they said, but Reed only smiled, her sympathy bold as the arbor’s edges. [261]

She organized the search at dusk, when the orchard’s crystals hummed like tuning forks, when the crater’s glow bled into the sky. [280]

They split into pairs: the baker and the glassblower, the child who collected broken things and the woman who mended them, each duo following the tags deeper into the crater’s maze. [306]

Reed went alone, her path lit by the arbor’s reflected light, her breath syncing with the pulse of the lost languages below. [325]

She found Syl not at the crater’s heart, but at its lip—a figure crouched, painting a new tag onto the obsidian arbor itself. [346]

*"You didn’t have to look,"* Syl said, not unkindly. [352]

Reed stepped forward. "But we did." [355]

The tag read: *We are here, and so are you.* [361]

Syl’s hands were stained with the same violet as the crater’s glow, their sleeves rolled to reveal scars like reed-marks, like the grooves of Reed’s own carvings. [383]

They didn’t speak of origins or goodbyes. [388]

Instead, Syl handed her a can of paint, and together they finished the arbor’s dedication, the village emerging from the crater’s mist to add their handprints to the wet surface. [416]

By dawn, the obsidian bore a constellation of touches—proof that kinship wasn’t found, but made. [430]

The festival began with Reed at its center, not as the sculptor who built the arbor, but as the one who had dared to search. [450]

Syl slipped away before the first dance, leaving only another tag on the crater’s edge: *Stay. We’ll find you.* [465]

Reed didn’t chase. [467]

She knew some webs were meant to be woven slowly, some kin arrived in their own time. [478]

The arbor stood complete now, its glimmer not from the light it caught, but from the hands that had shaped it. [495]

That night, as the villagers slept, Reed pressed her palm to the obsidian and felt the hum of the crater answer back—not with words, but with the ache of recognition. [520]

She had grafted herself onto the village, yes, but more than that: she had learned that belonging was not a place, but a current, something that moved through you when you reached out. [550]

And for the first time, the lost languages didn’t sound like an ending. [558]

They sounded like an invitation. [560]
