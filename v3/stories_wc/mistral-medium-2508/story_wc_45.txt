The hedge maze had always been a riddle no one bothered to solve—until Liora found the gap. [18]

It wasn’t a door or a path, just a slight bowing of the branches where the wind had worn the leaves thin, revealing a sliver of golden light beyond. [36]
She slipped through, her fingers brushing the waxy green, and emerged into a garden that shouldn’t have existed: vines heavy with fruit no one had ever tasted, flowers that pulsed faintly when touched, and at its center, a stone well carved with symbols that made her teeth ache. [73]
Liora was a forgiving skeptic—she believed in lies more easily than truths, but she never held them against anyone. [89]
That was why, when she saw the tooth glinting on the well’s rim, she didn’t scream. [101]

It was too small to be human, too sharp to be animal, the root still damp with blood. [113]
A changeling’s baby tooth. [116]
She picked it up, and the garden sighed around her, the air thick with the scent of crushed mint and something older, like iron left in the rain. [132]
Liora had spent years bone-setting for the village—resetting fractures, coaxing limbs back to true—but this was different. [147]
This was a cleft in certainty, a crack in the world’s skin. [156]

Three days earlier, they’d found the substitute body in the river: a hollowed-out thing stitched with river reeds, wearing the face of Liora’s brother before he’d run away. [178]
The villagers had burned it without a word, but Liora had kept the charred needle from its chest, because she yearned to understand. [195]
Not why he’d left—that was simple—but why the world had let something else wear his shape. [210]

She pressed the tooth to her palm, and the garden answered. [218]
The well’s symbols flared like embers, and the vines trembled, revealing a figure crouched in the undergrowth—a child with too many joints, eyes like polished river stones. [238]
*"You dropped this,"* Liora said, shrewdly innocent, and held out the tooth. [248]
The changeling hissed, then stilled, its gaze flicking to the needle in her other hand. [258]
*"You’re not him,"* Liora murmured. *"But you remember him."* [267]

The creature lunged, not to attack, but to press its forehead to hers, and suddenly she was drowning in memories not her own: her brother laughing as he stole apples, the way his hands shook when he lied, the night he’d cut his palm on the well’s edge and bled something darker than blood. [305]
The garden had taken the wound and spun it into a door. [313]
The changeling was the lock. [316]

Liora exhaled, her breath steady despite the weight of it. [323]
*"You can have him back,"* she whispered. *"But you have to make it right."* [333]
She didn’t know if the rules of the garden allowed for bargains, but she knew the shape of mistakes—how they festered if left unstitched. [349]
The changeling’s fingers twitched, and the well water rose, black and silver, forming a map of constellations where the wounds had been. [365]
*"Turn them into stars,"* Liora said. *"So we can find our way."* [374]

The garden listened. [376]
The tooth dissolved into light, and the changeling’s form rippled, shedding its borrowed skin like a snake. [388]
When Liora stepped back through the hedge, her brother was waiting by the river, his sleeves rolled up, his palms smooth and unmarked. [406]
*"You’re late,"* he said, grinning, and the village behind them was whole again, the air smelling of woodsmoke and possibility. [423]
Liora tucked the needle into her apron pocket, where it hummed faintly against her ribs. [434]
Some doors shouldn’t stay closed. [438]
Some cracks were meant to let the light in. [444]

That night, she dreamed of the garden, of the changeling’s new teeth growing in straight and bright, of the well water rising to meet the sky. [464]
When she woke, her hands were steady. [468]
She had always been good at setting bones. [473]
Now she knew how to set the world. [478] </story>
