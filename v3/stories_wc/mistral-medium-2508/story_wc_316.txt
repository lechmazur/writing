The floating rock dojo hovered above the storm-wracked valley, its moss-slicked edges humming with the weight of forgotten wars. [21]
Kael sat cross-legged at its center, his breath shallow, his fingers tracing the glass of the jar beside him—the one labeled *DUPLICATE* in peeling ink, the one holding his own brain, pulsing faintly in amber fluid. [49]
He’d survived the ego death during the Schism, when the monks had split his mind to outrun the Emperor’s memory-wipes, but the cost was this: half of him lived in that jar, silent, watching, while the other half moved through the world like a ghost wearing skin. [95]
The dojo’s wooden doors groaned open, and Veyra stepped in, her boots leaving wet prints on the tatami—she’d walked through the storm to get here, because of course she had. [125]
“You brought it,” Kael said, not looking up. [130]
She tossed a second jar onto the mat between them; this one’s label read *ORIGINAL*, though the brain inside was identical, right down to the scar where the Schism’s blade had parted them. [155]
“Custody hearing’s in three days,” she said, her voice slicing through the pretense like a honed blade. [168]
Kael exhaled. The clone custody battle had been brewing since the war ended, since the Emperor’s historians started rewriting the past to erase the monks’ rebellion—since the two halves of him had begun arguing in his sleep. [201]
The *Duplicate* brain pulsed faster. He pressed his palm to the glass, feeling the faint thrum of his other self’s frustration: *We were never supposed to be split this long.* [222]
Veyra crouched, her dark eyes reflecting the storm outside. “They’ll rule in favor of the *Original*. [232]
Always do.” She tapped the second jar. “But you and I know that’s a lie. [240]
Neither of you is whole.” [243]
Kael’s fingers twitched. The monks had taught him to vivify the severed—*through complementary opposites*—but no one had ever tried it on a mind. [258]
The dojo creaked as history rewrote itself below them, the valley’s echoes shifting, the Emperor’s new timeline swallowing old truths. [273]
If he didn’t act now, both halves would be dissolved, repurposed into loyal subjects. [282]
He unsheathed the dagger at his belt, the one forged from the same metal as the Schism’s blade, and pressed the tip to his palm. [297]
Veyra didn’t flinch. “You’re not thinking of—” [303]
“Merging us.” Blood welled, dark and slow. [307]
He let it drip onto the *Duplicate* jar first, then the *Original*, the liquid hissing where it met the glass. [318]
The brains twitched in unison. [320]
Pain lanced through his skull—*his* skull, *their* skull—as the two halves lunged for each other across the years of silence, the Schism’s wound stitching shut with a sound like tearing silk. [345]
Veyra caught him as he sagged, her grip bruising. “You idiot,” she breathed, but her voice was thick. [355]
The dojo’s walls trembled. Outside, the storm broke, but the valley’s echoes didn’t change. [364]
History had stopped rewriting itself. [367]
Kael laughed, the sound raw and full, because for the first time in years, he felt the weight of his own emotions—not the numb half-life of a split mind, but the crushing, glorious *all* of it. [392]
Veyra helped him stand. Below them, the Emperor’s banners were already burning. [401]
The jars were empty now, the brains dissolved into something greater. [409]
Kael flexed his fingers, the dagger still warm in his grip. “Tell the judges the case is moot,” he said. [422]
She smirked. “And if they ask how?” [425]
He sheathed the blade. “Tell them the truth sliced through their pretense.” [435]
The dojo rose higher, carried by the wind of a world no longer chained to lies. [445]
Veyra watched the horizon, where the first new histories were being written. “What now?” [452]
Kael touched his chest, where his heart beat steady and whole. “Now,” he said, “we defeat the numbness.” [464]
The storm’s last drops fell like blessings as they stepped into the dawn. [471]
