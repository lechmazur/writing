The tower stood like a splinter in the dawn, its stone skin still damp from the night’s slow weeping. [17]
Liora pressed her palm against the frost-laced window, her breath fogging the glass where the hourglass on the sill had bled cold into the air. [34]
Its sand was motionless, frozen mid-fall—just like the words in her throat since the surgery, since the doctors had carved out the tumor and left her with a scar that pulsed when the plants in the courtyard whispered. [65]

She shouldn’t have been able to hear them. [70]
But the anesthesia had worn off three days ago, and now the ivy curling up the tower’s cracks hummed like a tuning fork, its voice thin with thirst. [88]
*You are the one who listens,* it murmured, tendrils tightening around the stone’s old wounds. [99]
Liora’s fingers twitched toward the scar at her collarbone, the ridge of it warm as if the knife had only just withdrawn. [114]
She wanted to read it the way she read the coffee rings left on her desk each morning—concentric confessions, brown halos of hesitation and haste. [130]

Downstairs, the archive of surgical records waited, each file a map of someone else’s unraveling. [140]
She had spent years chasing closure for strangers, prying open their sealed pain like a lockpick, only to leave them raw and herself hollow. [157]
But the plants knew things. [160]
The fern in the corner, its fronds trembling, showed her a memory not her own: a child pressing a dandelion to a skinned knee, the golden pollen sticking like a failed miracle. [183]
Liora’s breath hitched. [185]
Displaced miracles—that’s what scars were. [188]
Healing that arrived too late, in the wrong place. [193]

She turned the hourglass over. [196]
The sand didn’t fall. [198]
Of course it didn’t. [200]
Time had frozen the moment the tumor was cut out, the moment she became accidentally telepathic with the green, suffering things. [215]
The tower groaned around her, its beams whispering of the earth it had been dragged from, the roots still tangled beneath its foundation. [232]
She pressed her ear to the wall. [236]
The stone was tunneling—no, *being* tunneled through. [241]
Not by worms or water, but by something older, something that moved by examining the rings of things: the growth lines in bones, the ripples in a cup of untouched tea. [263]

Liora’s knees gave. [266]
She was the thing in the walls. [269]
She had always been. [271]
The plants had known before she did—her hands, restless, had spent a lifetime tracing the stories in scars, hers and others’, because she was the wound that wouldn’t close. [292]
The hourglass thawed in her grip. [296]
Sand hissed onto the sill, counting down to something. [302]

The archive door creaked open on its own. [306]
Files rustled like dry leaves, their edges browning as if autumn had come for them early. [318]
One slid free: her mother’s. [321]
The scar on the page was a jagged line across a liver, the doctor’s notes calling it *unremarkable*. [333]
Liora’s vision blurred. [335]
The fern’s voice slithered into her skull: *You think you seek endings, but you dig for beginnings.* [348]
Her fingers found the scar at her throat, the one that mirrored the shape of her mother’s last breath. [362]

The tower shuddered. [364]
Dust rained from the rafters, settling on the hourglass like snow. [371]
Liora exhaled, her breath unfreezing the sand again, just for a second. [380]
She understood now: the miracle wasn’t in the healing. [386]
It was in the wound itself—the way it held time, the way it whispered if you knew how to listen. [402]

She picked up a pen. [405]
On her mother’s file, beside the scar the doctors had dismissed, she wrote: *Here lies the shape of her love. It did not save her. It only remembered.* [428]
The plants sighed, a sound like wind through a graveyard of dandelions. [438]
Outside, the first light split the horizon, and for the first time, Liora let the scar on her collarbone ache without trying to decode it. [456]
Some stories weren’t meant to be read. [460]
They were meant to be carried. [462]

The hourglass ran out. [465]
The tower stood quiet, its wounds finally allowed to stay open. [473]
And Liora—closure seeker, accidental listener, daughter of a displaced miracle—began to tunnel not toward answers, but into the hush where questions could breathe. [499]
Dawn held its breath with her. [502]
The world, for once, did not demand to be understood. [509] </story>
