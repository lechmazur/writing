The velvet observatory hummed with the scent of crushed violets and old parchment, its domed ceiling stretched taut over the midsummer sky. [18]
Dr. Elara Vey adjusted the brass eyepiece of her telescope, though she wasn’t watching stars—she was tracing the fracture lines in a transparent violin, carved from a single ice crystal mined from the Glissando Tundra. [45]
It had arrived that morning in a lead-lined case, sent by a collector who claimed it played melodies only the dead could hear. [63]
Elara’s fingers hovered over the instrument, her breath fogging the air; she wasn’t a musician, but a provenance researcher, paid to unearth the hidden lives of objects before they were sold to empires. [88]
This one thrummed against her skin like a second pulse, its cold seeping into her bones, whispering of a destiny already perforated by choices not yet made. [109]

She shouldn’t have drunk the coffee. [113]
The dregs in her chipped porcelain cup swirled into a pattern—a ship’s mast snapping, a field of poppies bleeding into ink—but Elara had long since stopped ignoring the future when it sloshed against the sides of her mind. [135]
The violin’s previous owner, a composer named Silas Hark, had propagated his final symphony through the ice itself, freezing the notes into the crystal’s lattice. [153]
The collector wanted it for his vault, where such things were hoarded like stolen time. [162]
Elara’s contract demanded she verify its authenticity before the auction at dawn, before the promise of its song lost its glow to the highest bidder. [180]

Outside, the observatory’s gardens rustled. [184]
She pressed her palm to the glass wall, and the wisteria vines coiled tighter around the iron trellis, their thoughts brushing hers like silk: *They will take it. They always take.* [204]
Elara’s gift—accidental, unwanted—had begun after the incident in the Orrery of Lost Hours, where she’d pricked her finger on a thorn and suddenly understood the scream of a dying fern. [228]
Plants remembered everything. [232]
They knew the weight of a dream held against an empire’s hunger, knew how easily both could wither. [244]

The violin’s case clicked open on its own. [249]
Inside, the ice caught the light of the dual moons, refracting a spectrum of grief and something sharper: defiance. [261]
Elara reached in, and the moment her fingertips touched the strings, the observatory trembled. [271]
The coffee stains had shown her two paths—deliver the violin and be paid enough to buy her freedom, or shatter it and let Silas Hark’s symphony dissolve into the summer air, unowned. [294]
The vines outside groaned, their leaves curling inward as if bracing for a storm. [305]
*Propagate,* they urged. *Let it grow.* [310]

She lifted the violin to her shoulder, though she’d never played a note in her life. [320]
The first sound was not music but a voice, Silas’s, threaded through the ice: *"You’re the one who hears them, aren’t you? The things that can’t speak."* [338]
Elara’s breath hitched. [341]
The melody that followed was not for ears—it vibrated in her ribs, in the sap of the wisteria, in the slow turn of the observatory’s gears. [357]
It was a song of roots splitting stone, of seeds carried on illegal winds, of a future where empires were only compost for what came after. [376]

The collector’s men would arrive at midnight. [380]
She had until then to decide: weigh the violin against her contract, or weigh her contract against the world. [393]
The coffee stains had already darkened into a third option, one that tasted like mulberry ache—smashing the violin now, before it could be caged, and scattering its shards across the gardens. [416]
The plants would remember how to make it sing. [421]
The empire would call it vandalism. [425]
She would call it propagation. [428]

Elara set the violin on the observatory’s central table, where the moonlight pooled like liquid silver. [440]
She picked up the telescope’s brass counterweight—the only thing heavy enough—and brought it down. [450]
The ice exploded into a thousand prismatic needles, and the gardens below gasped as the fragments took root in the soil, sprouting delicate, humming crystals. [468]
The wisteria unfurled a single, perfect bloom above her head, its petals the exact violet of the observatory’s walls. [483]
*Thank you,* it sighed, and Elara understood, at last, that some destinies were meant to be perforated—so the light could get in. [503]

When the collector’s men kicked open the door at midnight, they found only a woman kneeling in the dirt, her hands covered in thorns and starlight, and a garden that had begun, quite impossibly, to sing. [530]
They would report her as a thief, a fraud, a madwoman. [538]
She would let them. [540]
Some dreams were heavier than empires, and Elara Vey had finally learned how to carry hers. [554]
By dawn, the first ice-vine would break through the observatory’s velvet roof, reaching for the sun. [568]
