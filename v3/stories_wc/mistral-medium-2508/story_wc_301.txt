The last train had left decades ago, but Elias still heard its ghost in the rusted tracks beneath the ivy. [19]

He crouched in the station’s crumbling ticket booth, fingers tracing the peeling map tacked to the wall—a relic of routes long abandoned, ink faded where rivers used to be named. [43]

The accordion bellows lay beside him, its cracked leather patched with yellowed tape, the kind of repair that spoke of stubbornness more than skill. [65]

Elias had stopped the medication three weeks ago, not because he believed in clarity without it, but because the fog had started to feel like a second skin, and he needed to know what was left beneath. [97]

He was a river chronicler by trade—or had been, before the drought, before the maps stopped matching the land. [116]

Now he hunted for truths in the margins: the way water left stains on old timetables, the way bathroom graffiti in the station’s locked women’s lavatory whispered, *"The river remembers what you burned."* [143]

Daringly methodical, that’s how his sister had once described him, back when she still answered his letters. [158]

He’d taken it as praise then, but now he wondered if method was just another word for refusal—to grieve, to forget, to let the current take him. [180]

The station’s roof sagged under ivy’s weight, sunlight filtering through in jagged patches, illuminating the graffiti like a code. [198]

*"Turn left at the third bridge if you’re brave. Turn right if you’re sorry."* [209]

Elias had been both, once. [212]

He pressed his palm to the map, to the place where the Blackthorn River should have been, where he’d last seen his sister before the argument, before the fire, before the things he’d said became the kind of weight that didn’t float. [242]

The accordion bellows sighed as he squeezed them, not a tune, just breath—his own, recycled. [255]

He’d found them in a flooded church basement, half-submerged, the tape holding them together like a scar. [272]

Some chronicler he was. [275]

The river had dried; the maps lied; his hands shook when he tried to sketch the new banks. [288]

But the graffiti didn’t lie. [291]

*"The third bridge is where the water learns to walk."* [298]

He knew that bridge. [301]

Knew the way the pilings still bore the marks of the flood that took the mill, the one he’d failed to predict, the one that had made his sister look at him like he’d betrayed the land itself. [333]

His fingers twitched toward the bellows again. [338]

If he played, would the station answer? [342]

Would the ivy part like a curtain? [345]

Would the map finally show him the path to self-forgiveness, or was that just another myth scrawled in bathroom-stall philosophy? [362]

He stood, joints protesting, and stepped over the broken turnstile. [372]

The platform stretched ahead, swallowed by time and green, the tracks disappearing into the distance like a promise. [386]

Elias had spent years alluding to the truth in his chronicles—hinting at the drought’s causes, the diverted streams, the deals made in backrooms while the river choked. [410]

But he’d never named himself among the guilty. [417]

The third bridge was a day’s walk. [421]

He could make it before the rains came, before the ivy claimed the station entirely, before he decided to start the medication again and let the fog win. [443]

He slung the bellows over his shoulder, their weight uneven, the tape groaning. [453]

At the edge of the platform, he paused. [457]

The graffiti had one last line, half-erased: *"Some bridges don’t cross water."* [468]

Elias exhaled. [470]

Then he stepped forward, boots crushing ivy, following the path the map didn’t show. [481]

The river might be gone, but the land remembered. [487]

And so did he. [489]

By the time he reached the bridge, the sky had turned the color of old bruises. [498]

The Blackthorn’s bed was a trench of cracked earth, but the pilings stood like sentinels, their shadows long and accusatory. [515]

Elias sat at the waterline that wasn’t there anymore and pulled the bellows into his lap. [528]

He didn’t play. [530]

Instead, he pressed his forehead to the patched leather and listened. [538]

The wind carried the scent of damp stone and something older—wet wood, maybe, or the memory of it. [553]

He thought of his sister’s last letter: *"You mapped the rivers, but you never learned to swim in them."* [570]

The bellows creaked as he squeezed, a sound like a door opening. [580]

Not forgiveness. [582]

Not yet. [583]

But a beginning. [584]

Elias stood, brushed the dust from his knees, and turned right. [593]

The path wasn’t on any map, but the ivy parted for him. [602]

For the first time in years, he didn’t look back. [609]
