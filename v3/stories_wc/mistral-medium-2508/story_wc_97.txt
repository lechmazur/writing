The tidal arbor stretched its gnarled branches above the clouds, a place where the wind hummed through the leaves like a half-remembered tune. [25]
Lena sat at the station piano, her fingers brushing the keys with the weight of a woman who knew every note was a ghost of what could have been. [47]
The instrument had been abandoned here decades ago, its ivories yellowed by salt and time, but she coaxed melodies from it as if it still owed her something. [74]
Beside her, the anniversary clock—its brass face cracked, its pendulum still—ticked in silence, a relic from the day her lover had promised to return before the horizon invited night. [104]
She’d wound it every dawn since, though it never moved. [112]

The compasses in her pocket flickered like dying fireflies, their needles spinning not toward magnetic north but toward something far less certain. [130]
Lena had spent years studying their erratic dances, mapping the invisible currents that pulled at the arbor when the tides shifted above the clouds. [153]
She was strategically creative, turning superstition into science, desperation into a plan. [165]
Tonight, she would surprise fate with an unplanned encore. [173]

Beneath the piano bench, a black-and-white film reel sat coiled in its canister, its edges notched with hidden sections only she could read. [191]
The footage was old—grainy images of the arbor in its prime, when the station had been a waypoint for skyfarers and the clock had kept perfect time. [213]
But Lena had spliced in something new: frames of a path, revealed only when the light hit the celluloid just right. [230]
A refuge, hidden in the flicker between what was and what could be. [240]

She threaded the reel into the projector, its bulb casting long shadows as the arbor groaned around her. [255]
The film stuttered to life, images bleeding into one another—a door where there had been only bark, a staircase spiraling into the mist where the branches ended. [278]
The compasses in her pocket shuddered, their needles locking in unison toward the screen. [291]
Lena exhaled, her breath visible in the thinning light. [297]

She played as she walked, the piano’s notes stretching behind her like a wake, the clock in her arms suddenly warm, its pendulum swinging once, twice. [319]
The film’s path unfolded ahead, each step syncing with the music as if the arbor itself were conducting. [333]
She didn’t look back when the projector sputtered out, its bulb burning brightest just before it died. [349]
Somewhere beyond the clouds, the horizon was swallowing the sun, and the night was coming whether she was ready or not. [369]

The door in the film was real now, its hinges whispering as she pushed it open. [380]
Inside, the air smelled of ozone and old paper, the walls lined with maps drawn in ink that shimmered like the compass hands. [400]
A figure stood at the far end, silhouette familiar as a half-forgotten dream, turning slowly as the clock in Lena’s arms chimed—a sound it hadn’t made in years. [427]
“You’re late,” she said, but her voice was steady, her longing steely as the blade of a knife unsheathed after a long war. [445]

He smiled, the kind of smile that belonged to a man who had spent lifetimes learning how to apologize without words. [463]
“So are you,” he replied, and the arbor outside sighed, its branches settling like the hands of a clock finally at rest. [484]

Lena set the anniversary clock on the table between them, its pendulum swinging true for the first time in years. [503]
The compasses in her pocket stilled, their needles pointing inward, toward each other. [515]
She sat at a new piano—this one untouched by time—and began to play, not for the past, but for the encore neither of them had dared to imagine. [538]
Outside, the night rolled in, but the arbor held them, suspended above the clouds, above the rules of endings. [557]
The music rose, and for once, the wind carried it forward instead of away. [570]
