The observatory hung like a splinter in the sky, its steel ribs groaning as the last circuit breakers hissed into silence. [17]
Lena pressed her palm against the cold glass dome, watching the storm below—lightning stitching the ruins of the city where her wedding had been reduced to a drone’s afterimage. [39]
She hadn’t screamed when the strike came, only noted the way her veil had floated upward in the blast wave, intangibly tangible, like the ghost of a choice she’d never get to make. [65]
Now, three weeks later, her fingers traced the geode in her pocket, its jagged surface a map of something she couldn’t name. [84]

The crystal had been a gift from her father, a geologist who’d called it "a pocket of unused time." [99]
She’d laughed then, but now she understood: potential wasn’t something you spent—it was something you hunted. [115]
The observatory’s scientists had brought her here under the guise of "atmospheric research," but Lena knew the truth. [130]
They were tracking perturbations, the way reality flickered at the edges when too much future pressed against too little past. [147]

"Subject 7’s readings are spiking again," a technician murmured, his voice static through the intercom. [160]
Lena didn’t turn. She’d long since stopped being a subject. [167]
The geode pulsed in her grip, warm now, as if the storm outside had seeped into its core. [180]
Perturbation theory wasn’t just math—it was a knife. [186]
You didn’t solve for the unknown; you cut until the equation bled. [194]

She’d spent the first week after the strike in a hospital bed, her skin still smelling of burnt sugar and copper. [209]
The second week, she’d stolen a hard drive from the morgue’s security office, watching footage of her own survival like it was someone else’s life. [229]
The third week, she’d found the observatory’s coordinates scribbled on the back of her father’s old field notes, beside a sketch of the geode with a single word: *awaken*. [250]

The dome’s metal groaned again, the sound like a breath held too long. [260]
Lena placed the geode on the console, its fractured planes refracting the emergency lights into something almost holy. [275]
The scientists had warned her not to touch the equipment while the breakers cooled, but warnings were for people who still believed in consequences. [293]
She keyed in the frequency from her father’s notes, the one that matched the harmonic resonance of the crystal. [310]

The observatory shuddered. [312]
On the screens, the storm’s chaos resolved into patterns—a lattice of bright threads where the drone strike had torn through the fabric of the day. [330]
One thread glowed brighter. [332]
Not her wedding. [334]
Not her survival. [336]
The moment *before* the drone’s operator had made the choice to fire. [344]

Lena’s pulse hammered in her throat. [347]
This was where potential pooled—not in the future, but in the unmade past, the decisions that had almost been different. [362]
The geode hummed against her skin, its weight both impossible and undeniable. [373]
She could reach in. [375]
She could pull that thread. [377]

The lead scientist’s voice cracked over the intercom: "Lena, *stop*—you’ll collapse the field!" [390]
Bleak exhilaration flooded her, sharp as the geode’s edges. [397]
She wasn’t trying to change what had happened. [403]
She was hunting the place where change had been possible, where her wedding had still been just a wedding, where the drone had still been just a machine waiting for a command. [426]

Her finger hovered over the console. [430]
The observatory’s alarms wailed, a chorus of protest against the violence of knowing. [441]
Lena smiled. [443]
For the first time since the strike, she wasn’t a survivor. [449]
She was the perturbation. [451]

The screen went white. [453]
Then— [454]
A wedding tent, fluttering. [456]
A drone, hesitating. [458]
Her own voice, unbroken: *"I do."* [461]

The observatory’s lights died. [464]
In the sudden dark, Lena exhaled, the geode cold again in her hand. [471]
She wasn’t there to fix the past. [475]
She was there to remember what it had felt like to stand on the edge of it, to feel the weight of a choice before it was made. [492]
The scientists would call this a failure. [496]
She called it an awakening. [498]

Outside, the storm raged on, indifferent. [502]
Lena tucked the geode back into her pocket and stepped into the dark, hunting. [513] </story>
