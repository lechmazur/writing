The library had forgotten its own name, its shelves sagging under the weight of scrolls older than memory, their edges frayed like the hem of a god’s discarded robe. [32]

At its heart stood Veythas, the diminutive titan—no taller than a mortal’s waist but carved from the same obstinate stone as mountains, his regally unpretentious bearing the quiet authority of one who had watched empires crumble without comment. [67]

He traced a finger along the spine of a tome bound in dragonhide, its title long since flaked away, and paused where the iron gall ink pellet had been pressed into the parchment like a wound. [97]

The pellet was no accident. [101]

Veythas knew the rune of drift when he saw it: a sigil that unmoored time, letting moments bleed into one another like ink in rain. [123]

Someone had been leaving messages here, tucked between the pages of books no living scholar dared open, their words appearing only when the constellations paused in their celestial dance—a breath held across centuries. [158]

*The pretender walks among you,* the first had read, its letters etched in that same corrosive ink. [174]

Veythas had spent three hundred years ignoring the warnings. [181]

But then the second came: *The throne is a lie, and the lie is a knife.* [192]

And the third, found just that morning, pressed into the margin of a treatise on forgotten dynasties: *Sunder the crown, or it will sunder you.* [214]

He exhaled, the sound like shifting sand. [219]

The temple library was a relic of the Old Kings, a place where time folded in on itself, where a careless step could drop you into yesterday or tomorrow. [239]

The pretender had chosen it well. [244]

Veythas moved to the central dais, where the last true king’s scepter lay—not gold, but black basalt, veined with the same rune that now festered in the books. [267]

To sunder it would be to unmake the false sovereign’s claim, to peel back the illusion like rotten parchment. [283]

But the act required more than strength. [288]

It demanded a sacrifice: the name of the one who had left the messages. [298]

Veythas closed his eyes. [301]

He had known, of course. [304]

The ink was her favorite—bitter, indelible, the kind that ate through lies. [313]

Lirien, his oldest friend, who had sworn to guard the throne’s truth even as she faded into the cracks between time. [329]

She had been the first to see the pretender’s face, the first to understand the cost of silence. [344]

Now she was the last warning. [348]

With a breath that tasted of dust and old promises, Veythas lifted the scepter. [360]

The rune of drift pulsed, hungry. [364]

He whispered her name into the dark. [369]

The library shuddered. [372]

Shelves splintered. [374]

The constellations above the oculus stuttered, their light fracturing like glass. [383]

And then—silence. [385]

The scepter cracked down its length, not from force, but from the weight of a truth too long denied. [403]

The pretender’s face, when Veythas found him in the ruins of the throne room, was not one of defiance, but of relief. [421]

*"I never wanted it,"* the man admitted, his crown slipping like a poorly fitted mask. [435]

Veythas did not answer. [438]

He knelt instead, gathering the shattered basalt, the ink-stained parchment, the last remnants of a kingdom that had died quietly, gracefully, as all things must when their time is done. [465]

Outside, the stars began to move again. [471]

The library sighed, its walls settling into a new kind of stillness—not the silence of abandonment, but the hush of something finally, mercifully, complete. [496]

Veythas stayed until dawn, when the first true light in centuries spilled through the broken roof, illuminating the words he carved into the dais with the last of Lirien’s ink: [533]

*"Here the lie ended. Here the drift was still."* [542]

Then he walked out, his footsteps the only sound in a world that had, at last, remembered how to breathe. [560]
