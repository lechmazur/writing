The driftwood circle groaned as the tide prophet Leeward shifted his weight, his bare feet pressing into the damp bark. [18]
Above him, the sky bled indigo—blue hour, when the world held its breath between dusk and dark, and the clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music. [35]
He tilted his head, watching the high cirrus fray into fractal tendrils, his fingers twitching as if plucking invisible strings. [52]
To others, the clouds were just weather; to Leeward, they were the sketch of a song not yet sung, a resonance waiting to be coaxed into sound. [74]

At his feet lay the xylophone mallet, its head wrapped in salt-stiffened cloth, its weight familiar as a pulse. [88]
He’d carved it from a branch that had once been part of the orchard’s spine—a pear tree, uprooted in the last storm but too stubborn to die. [106]
Now it floated with him, roots tangled in the driftwood’s embrace, its few remaining fruits glowing faintly in the dim, as if lit from within by the same restless energy that hummed in Leeward’s bones. [132]

A gust shuddered through the leaves, and the orchard answered with a chorus of creaks and whispers. [143]
He lifted the mallet, tapping it against the nearest gnarled root—a dull *thunk*, then a sharper *ping* as he struck a suspended iron pot half-buried in the wood. [161]
The sound hung, vibrating the air like a plucked harp string, and the clouds above rippled in response, their edges sharpening into geometric precision. [180]
This was the method: strike, listen, sketch. [185]
Each note sent tremors through the fractal patterns of the sky, and the sky, in turn, redrew itself, offering glimpses of what could be if only the obstacles were played right. [206]

Leeward’s motivation wasn’t to master the storm, but to *dub* it—to take the resistance of wind and wave and turn it into rhythm. [223]
The last time he’d tried, the sea had spat back a melody so jagged it split the mast of a passing junk; the sailors had cursed him, but he’d only laughed, because even their anger had been part of the composition. [248]
Tonight, though, the air felt different, charged with something thinner than salt—expectation, maybe, or the ghost of a tune not yet lost. [266]

He struck again, this time against a hollowed coconut husk strung between two branches, and the sound bloomed like a bruise. [282]
The clouds above twisted, their underbellies darkening into the shape of a hand, fingers outstretched as if conducting. [296]
Leeward grinned. [298]
This was the blue hour’s gift: the world half-asleep, its guard down, willing to be reshaped by whoever dared to listen. [316]

A wave lapped at the driftwood’s edge, and the orchard tilted. [324]
He didn’t fight the sway; instead, he leaned into it, letting the motion guide his next strike—a glancing blow against a cluster of seashells wired to a branch. [343]
The result was a cascade of chimes, high and brittle, and the cloud-hand clenched into a fist before dissolving into a spiral. [358]
Fractals within fractals. [361]
The resonance sketched itself across the sky, a temporary map of possibilities. [369]

Then, the sea answered. [372]
Not with a wave, but with a *voice*—a low, vibrating hum rising from the water, as if the tide itself had found a throat. [385]
Leeward’s breath caught. [388]
He’d spent years interpreting the language of clouds, but this was something older, something that didn’t need interpreting. [404]
The mallet trembled in his grip. [408]

He struck the orchard’s heart—a knot in the central driftwood log—and the hum swelled into a chord. [422]
The clouds fractured into a thousand shards of light, and for a moment, the blue hour held them all: the prophet, the floating grove, the sea’s sudden song. [440]
Obstacle had become instrument. [444]
The storm wasn’t coming to destroy, but to play. [450]

Leeward laughed, the sound raw and bright, and the sky laughed with him, a rolling thunder of euphony. [463]
The mallet was warm now, pulsing like a second heart. [470]
He didn’t know what came next—whether the orchard would sink or soar, whether the sea would swallow the song or sing it back. [487]
But for the first time, the restlessness in his chest wasn’t fear. [495]
It was the thrill of the next note. [499]

The blue hour deepened. [502]
Leeward raised the mallet again, and the world leaned in to listen. [512] </story>
