The poet had always believed that the most honest verses were written where the land hesitated—neither fully earth nor water, but a breath between. [30]

He knelt at the edge of the cobalt lagoon, the rain just lifted, the air still thick with the scent of wet salt and crushed reeds. [49]

His fingers brushed the sand, tracing patterns that dissolved as soon as they formed, like the half-remembered melodies of a song sung underwater. [72]

Then he saw it: a single drake’s tail feather, iridescent as oil on water, caught in the grip of a broken mussel shell. [92]

It was imperfect—barbed at the tip, frayed where the wind had worried it—but that was why he reached for it. [110]

The poet had spent years tending to the incomplete, collecting fragments others discarded: a chipped teacup, a rusted hinge, the last three notes of a lullaby his mother had never finished singing. [138]

He believed beauty wasn’t a thing you seized, but something you coaxed from the edges of ruin, by harmonizing discord. [157]

The lagoon mirrored the sky, but not perfectly—ripples warped the reflection, and where the water lapped at the shore, the blue deepened into something almost violet, like a bruise healing. [185]

He dipped the feather into the shallows, watching the water bead and cling, turning the vane into a dozen tiny prisms. [203]

A kite string snapped somewhere above him, the sudden *crack* startling a heron into flight, its wings stirring the warm, attentive silence. [224]

The poet didn’t look up. [227]

He was weaving dawns, or trying to—not the bold, unbroken ones that announced themselves in fanfare, but the quiet ones, the kind that slipped through the cracks of the world like light through a torn curtain. [258]

His latest work was a series of couplets, each line written at this hour, when the sky was still deciding whether to hold onto night or surrender to day. [283]

The feather became his quill. [287]

He pressed it to the damp page of his notebook, where the ink bled slightly, the words emerging as if already half-drowned: *"The lagoon does not apologize / for what it reflects or swallows."* [313]

A fisherman’s boat drifted past, its hull patched with mismatched wood, the seams sealed with tar and hope. [330]

The poet envied that boat. [334]

It didn’t pretend to be sleek or unscarred; it simply carried on, buoyed by the weight of its own imperfect history. [352]

He wrote another line: *"To love the broken thing is to love the break."* [364]

The feather trembled in his grip, not from his hand, but from the breeze that had found its way into the hollow shaft, humming a note so faint it might have been his own pulse. [392]

For the first time in months, the poem felt alive—not because it was finished, but because it wasn’t. [410]

The kite, now untethered, spiraled downward, its paper skin fluttering like a wounded bird before landing in the shallows. [432]

The poet waded in, his trousers darkening with water, and retrieved it. [441]

The string was frayed where it had snapped, the wood of the spindle worn smooth by time and handling. [457]

He wound the remaining thread around his wrist, tying it loosely, a reminder that some connections were meant to be temporary. [480]

Back on shore, he laid the kite beside his notebook, the feather resting across both like a bridge. [495]

The sun, no longer indecisive, spilled gold across the lagoon, and for a moment, the poet thought he saw the water shiver—not with wind, but with something like recognition. [523]

He didn’t write it down. [527]

Some things were better left unstitched, their edges allowed to fray. [536]

The heron returned, stepping delicately through the reeds, its reflection wavering in the cobalt shallows. [552]

The poet smiled. [555]

The day was incomplete, the poem was incomplete, he was incomplete—and that was the point. [572]

He picked up the feather and wrote the last line he would ever write about the lagoon: *"We are all just woven dawns, coming undone."* [598]
