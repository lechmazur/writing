The mangroves breathed in salt and exhaled mist, their gnarled roots cradling the black water like a secret. [20]

Liora moved through them with her fingers brushing the bark, each knot a whisper, each hollow a sigh—she had learned long ago that the spirits here sang in the spaces between words. [45]

She was a medium, but not the kind who summoned the dead for coins; she listened for the living who couldn’t speak, the ones whose voices had curled into unsent letters, folded so tight they bled. [74]

Tonight, she carried one in her pocket, the paper soft as a pulse beneath her thumb. [87]

It was from her sister, or rather, *to* her sister—a confession Liora had written and rewritten until the ink ran thin as the veins on her wrists. [108]

The gargoyle’s rainspout shard hung from her neck on a frayed cord, its jagged edge still sharp enough to draw blood if she pressed too hard. [129]

She had found it in the ruins of the old cathedral, where the stone wept when the moon was high. [142]

The shard healed in moonlight, knitting its cracks shut by dawn, just as Liora’s own scars faded when she stood too long in the silver dark. [161]

She didn’t know if that was magic or just time pretending to be kind. [171]

The spirits in the mangroves hummed a tune without lyrics, their voices threading through the roots like water through lace. [186]

They knew about the letter. [189]

They always knew. [191]

Liora stopped at the heart of the labyrinth, where the trees grew so close their branches wove a dome above her. [205]

Here, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and something older—regret, maybe, or the weight of a choice not yet made. [222]

She exhaled against the nearest window of glass-smooth water, her breath fogging the surface. [234]

The condensation held, trembling, and she pressed her palm to it, evoking the words she hadn’t sent. [246]

*The river between us isn’t water but silence.* [252]

The letters formed in the mist, curling like smoke before dissolving. [259]

The spirits’ song swelled, not in judgment but in recognition—this was the space where an apology waits unspoken, where the heart still hovers between flight and surrender. [283]

Liora had spent years chasing that moment, the one just before deciding, where everything was still possible. [298]

She pulled the shard from her neck and pressed its edge to her palm, not deep enough to bleed, just enough to sting. [315]

The pain was a tether. [318]

The moonlight spilled through the branches, and the shard’s cracks began to seal, its stone drinking the light like water. [335]

She watched her own skin do the same, the old wounds on her arms smoothing, as if the past could be unwritten. [350]

But the letter in her pocket stayed crumpled. [355]

The spirits’ voices rose, not in song now but in a question: *What are you waiting for?* [366]

Liora closed her eyes. [369]

The answer was in the mangroves, in the shard, in the way the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the shore and the shore never let go. [388]

She evoked the words again, this time without fear. [394]

*I miss you.* [397]

*I was wrong.* [400]

*Stay.* [402]

The condensation held longer this time, the letters lingering like ghosts before the water swallowed them. [415]

The spirits fell silent. [418]

Somewhere beyond the labyrinth, her sister was sleeping, or waking, or standing at a window of her own, waiting for a sign. [435]

Liora folded the letter one last time and let it drift into the black water. [446]

The current took it, but not before the paper brushed her fingers—a touch as light as forgiveness. [459]

She turned toward home, the shard warm against her collarbone, its cracks gone, its edges smooth. [473]

The mangroves sighed as she passed, their song softer now, almost tender. [483]

The moon followed her, a pale witness, its light stitching her shadows to the path ahead. [496]

She didn’t look back. [499]

The moment before deciding was over. [503]

She had chosen. [505]

The spirits began to sing again, but this time, Liora hummed along. [515]

The labyrinth didn’t let go easily—its roots tangled around her ankles, its branches whispered warnings—but she stepped free anyway. [533]

At the edge of the trees, where the land met the open sky, she paused. [543]

The air smelled different here, like rain coming, like a door left ajar. [554]

Liora reached into her empty pocket and smiled. [560]

Some letters didn’t need to be sent to be heard. [567]

Some wounds didn’t need to heal to stop hurting. [574]

She walked on, the shard glowing faintly against her skin, the spirits’ song fading into the wind. [588]

Ahead, the world was quiet. [592]

Ahead, the world was waiting. [596]

And for the first time in years, so was she. [602]

The mangroves kept their secrets. [606]

But Liora didn’t. [608]

Not anymore. [610] </story>
