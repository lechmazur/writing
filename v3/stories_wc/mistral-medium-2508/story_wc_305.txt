The grotto hung suspended above the clouds like a forgotten breath, its umbral vines curling over stone arches worn smooth by centuries of wind. [20]

Sister Maren—her hands still rough from decades of tending the sick—paused at the threshold, the antique hairpin tucked into her sleeve pressing cold against her wrist. [37]

She had climbed the oldest fig tree at dawn, as she always did when the weight of forgiveness settled too heavy in her bones, and the branches had whispered what she already knew: contentment wasn’t something you seized, but something you unearthed. [63]

The hairpin had been her mother’s, then her grandmother’s before that, its silver filigree etched with a pattern of scallops—tiny, relentless waves that never quite broke. [82]

She had forgiven the man who burned the infirmary, the one who left her with nothing but ashes and the echo of screams, but forgiveness wasn’t the same as forgetting the hollow it carved. [105]

The grotto’s air smelled of damp earth and something older, like the first sigh of a world waking. [116]

Maren knelt, brushing her fingers over the moss that pulsed faintly with bioluminescent veins, a slow, patient heartbeat. [128]

The elders said this place was where the cycle of rebirth began—not with fire or flood, but with a quiet unraveling, a surrender so complete it became creation. [145]

She pressed the hairpin into the soil, letting the scalloped edge catch the dim light like a blade slicing through shadow. [158]

A voice, neither inside nor out, asked: *What do you seek?* [163]

"Not peace," Maren replied, her voice steady. "I’ve had enough of that fragile thing." [171]

She thought of the children she’d buried, the hands she’d held as life slipped like water through fingers, the way the fig tree’s roots always found purchase no matter how many times the storm tried to tear it from the cliff. [195]

"I want the source," she said. "The well before the drawing. The seed before the cracking." [205]

The grotto exhaled. [207]

The moss parted. [209]

Beneath the hairpin, a shoot unfurled—not green, but the color of twilight just before the stars remember themselves, its edges scalloped like the waves on the pin, like the scars on her own palms. [232]

Maren didn’t hesitate. [235]

She plucked it. [237]

The moment the stem touched her skin, the grotto trembled, the vines recoiling as if burned, and for a heartbeat, she saw it: the thread connecting every ending to every beginning, not a line but a spiral, not a wound but a cradle. [260]

The shoot dissolved into her veins like wine into water. [266]

When she stood, the hairpin was gone, but the fig tree outside bore a single silver fruit, heavy with the weight of choices not yet made. [282]

She climbed down, her steps lighter, not because the grief was less, but because she finally understood its shape—how it scalloped the edges of joy, how it fed the roots of what came next. [305]

The man who burned the infirmary was releasing doves in the village square when she found him, his hands shaking with the effort of letting go. [321]

She didn’t speak. [324]

Instead, she pressed the silver fruit into his palm and watched his fingers curl around it, his breath catching like a child’s first glimpse of the sea. [341]

That evening, as the sky bled into violet, Maren sat beneath the fig tree, its leaves rustling with the sound of a thousand unspoken names. [355]

The grotto would call to someone else soon. [360]

She was ready to answer when it did. [364]

But for now, she scalloped the edge of a fresh bandage with her knife, the motion steady, the thread unbroken, the cycle turning like the slow, kind hand of a clockmaker who knew every gear by heart. [387]

The children would come at dawn, their laughter already blooming in the dark. [396]

She would be waiting. [399]
