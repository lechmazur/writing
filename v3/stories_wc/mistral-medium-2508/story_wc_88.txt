The needle left a ghost of a sting where it had pierced his wrist, the last of the procedure’s echoes. [14]

Liam flexed his fingers, watching the veins pulse beneath skin that no longer remembered the weight of a switchblade or the drag of a trigger. [29]
The clinic had promised a clean slate—neural scrubbing, they called it—but the hollow behind his ribs said otherwise. [43]
Empathy, they’d assured him, would regrow like bone. [49]
He hadn’t told them he wasn’t sure he wanted it. [55]

His duffel held three things: a wad of unmarked bills, a newspaper from 2047 (smuggled out by a janitor who owed him), and the baseball. [71]
The stitching was frayed, the signature a jagged *J. T. Morrow*—the time traveler who’d autographed it in a diner booth two decades before Liam’s first arrest. [86]
*"For when you need a way back,"* Morrow had said, pressing it into his palm like a secret. [96]
Liam had laughed then. [98]
Now, he turned it in his fingers, the leather delicately robust, resisting the damp of the tunnel air. [107]

The map wasn’t on paper. [109]
It was in the newspaper’s margins, coded in the gaps between headlines about climate accords and obituaries for men who’d died before they were born. [124]
*"Follow the light that shouldn’t be,"* read one. [129]
*"The lake remembers what you forgot,"* read another. [135]
Liam’s flashlight flickered over the words, the beam swallowed by the tunnel’s throat. [143]
He’d been underground for hours, the city’s pulse muted to a distant hum, like a heart behind too many ribs. [154]

Then—the glow. [156]
Not the sickly yellow of his flashlight, but blue, deep and steady, seeping from a fissure in the rock. [166]
The air thickened, damp with the scent of algae and something older, like ozone after a storm that hadn’t happened yet. [179]
He squeezed through the gap. [182]

The lake stretched before him, its surface a mirror of bioluminescent veins, pulsing in time with something he couldn’t hear. [192]
The water was warm. [194]
He knelt, trailing his fingers through it, and the light flared where he touched, as if the lake were reading him. [206]
*"You’re not here to wash away,"* a voice said—not aloud, but in the space behind his sternum. [216]
*"You’re here to choose."* [218]

Liam’s reflection wavered. [220]
Not the man from the clinic’s brochure, all soft eyes and open hands, but the one from the alley, the one who’d left a boy bleeding for a debt unpaid. [234]
The water rippled, and for a second, he saw them all: the faces he’d tried to scrub from his memory, their mouths moving in silent reproach. [247]
*"Empathy isn’t something you get,"* the lake murmured. [253]
*"It’s something you give."* [255]

He thought of the baseball, of Morrow’s smirk in the diner. [260]
*"Time’s a labyrinth,"* the man had said. [264]
*"Every choice is a door. Most people just don’t see the hinges."* [271]
Liam’s throat tightened. [273]
He could drop the ball into the water, let the lake take the last piece of his past. [281]
Or he could throw it. [283]

He reared back and hurled it across the glow. [287]
The ball arced, a comet tail of disrupted light, and where it landed, the water *parted*—not with a splash, but a sigh. [302]
A path of dry stone emerged, leading to a shore that shouldn’t exist. [310]
The newspaper in his pocket burned against his thigh. [314]
*"The third headline,"* he whispered. [317]
*"‘Man Rebuilds Bridge He Once Burned.’"* [322]

The first step was the hardest. [325]
The second carried him forward. [327]
By the third, the lake’s voice was a hum in his bones, not an accusation but an invitation. [338]
The tunnel behind him collapsed with a sound like a held breath released. [346]

When he surfaced, the city was the same—same neon, same stink of rain on pavement—but the air tasted different. [359]
Like possibility. [361]
His hands were steady as he bought a coffee from a vendor whose eyes held no fear of him. [371]
The newspaper in the trash bin bore yesterday’s date. [376]
He didn’t check the headlines. [378]

That night, he found the boy from the alley—or the man he’d become—playing chess in a park lit by flickering streetlamps. [391]
The board between them was a minefield of choices. [395]
Liam sat. [396]
*"You here to finish it?"* the man asked, not looking up. [402]
Liam slid the pawn forward. [405]
*"No,"* he said. [407]
*"I’m here to start."* [409]

The man studied him, then nodded. [412]
Somewhere, a baseball rolled to a stop in the grass, untouched by time. [421] </story>
