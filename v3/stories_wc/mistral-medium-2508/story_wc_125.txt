The poet had been drifting for years, his boots worn thin by highways that never led anywhere. [14]

He slept that night in a terra-cotta grotto, its walls warm under his fingertips, the air thick with the scent of damp clay and crushed sage. [31]

Above him, the sky was a sieve of starlight, the constellations rearranged since the energy beings arrived—those silent, shimmering things that moved like oil on water. [52]

He found the rope coiled at the grotto’s mouth, its fibers frayed where someone had sawed through prison bars. [67]

The texture of it fascinated him: rough in some places, smooth in others, as if time itself had braided and unbraided the strands. [85]

He was ethically playful by nature, the kind of man who’d steal a loaf of bread just to leave a poem in its place. [101]

But this rope was different. [104]

It hummed when he touched it, not with sound but with *pattern*—a pulse like the energy beings’ light, like the way his own breath hitched when he thought too hard about the future. [126]

He unwound it slowly, uncovering layers: a knot tied by desperate hands, a stain that might’ve been blood or rust or both. [143]

Each inch revealed a choice—escape or surrender, freedom or the illusion of it. [154]

The beings had come after the prisons emptied, after the world decided some sins were too heavy to hold. [168]

They didn’t speak, but they *listened*, their forms rippling when he read his verses aloud, as if his words were threads they could weave into something new. [188]

That night, he tied the rope to a stalactite and swung it like a pendulum, watching the shadow it cast on the grotto wall. [206]

The arc was perfect, a hypnotic metronome: *tick—what was. [212]

tick—what could be.* [215]

He wondered if the prisoner who’d escaped had felt this same pull, this same ache to measure time not in hours but in *textures*. [233]

The beings gathered at the grotto’s edge, their light flickering in time with the rope’s sway. [245]

One reached out—not to stop him, but to *add* something: a strand of their own luminous thread, twisting into the frayed ends. [262]

The poet laughed, because of course they would. [268]

Impossible choices were their currency, their art. [273]

He could cut the rope now and walk away, or he could pull it taut and see what unraveled. [285]

He chose the latter. [288]

The grotto trembled as the rope snapped, but not from force—from *resonance*, like a plucked string singing the space between notes. [306]

The energy beings surged forward, their light spilling over him, and for a moment he saw it: the pattern beneath the pattern, the weave of every choice ever made. [328]

His hands burned where the rope had been, the frayed ends now smooth, now *alive*. [340]

The beings didn’t take him. [343]

They never did. [345]

They only showed him the shape of the question: *What do you do with a thread once you’ve pulled it?* [358]

He sat for a long time after they left, the grotto’s silence thicker than before. [369]

Then he took out his knife and began to carve the rope into something new—not a noose, not a leash, but a *ladder*. [385]

One rung for the prisoner. [388]

One for the beings. [391]

One for himself. [394]

He didn’t know if it would hold, but that was the point. [402]

The best patterns were the ones you had to climb to see. [410]

By dawn, the grotto was empty except for the ladder, its rungs casting long shadows as the sun rose over a world that no longer remembered what prisons were for. [430]

The poet was already gone, drifting again, his pockets lighter by one rope but heavier with the weight of a question he couldn’t answer—only live. [451]

Somewhere, the energy beings pulsed in response, their light bending just slightly, as if smiling. [464]

He didn’t look back. [467]

He never did. [469]

But the ladder stayed, a frayed and luminous thing, waiting for the next impossible choice to walk through the door. [485]

And the stars, newly arranged, watched it all with the quiet patience of witnesses who had seen this story before—and would see it again. [506]

The poet’s boots left no prints in the dust. [512]

Only the pattern remained. [515]

Only the texture of time, unspooling. [520]
