The wind turbines turned like slow, indifferent gods above the farmhouse, their blades cutting the sky into rhythmic slices of silence. [20]

Lena sat on the splintered porch, her face a smooth mask, the kind performers wear when the audience has long since left. [36]

In her lap, a dried bouquet of forget-me-nots and lavender crumbled at the edges, their color leached away by years of being clutched too tight. [53]

She didn’t cry. [56]

The Happiness Mandate had ended three years ago—officially, at least—but the habit of stillness lingered, a remade hush pressed into the bones of everyone who’d lived through it. [78]

Lena’s hands moved without thought, the pocketknife whittling a stick into something uselessly delicate, curls of wood falling like shed skin. [97]

Inside, the farmhouse groaned under the weight of unspoken things: her brother’s empty chair, the radio that no longer played state-approved cheer, the way the walls seemed to exhale dust when no one was looking. [122]

She had been a performer once, not on stages but in hospital rooms, narrating the mundane with dramatic flourish—*"And now, we adjust the pillow, a sacred act of rebellion!"*—while patients laughed through the pain. [151]

The Mandate had called it subversion. [154]

She called it lightness. [157]

The turbines hummed, a sound like a held breath, and Lena set the knife down, pressing the dried bouquet to her lips instead. [173]

It smelled of nothing. [176]

That was the problem with preserving grief—it lost its shape, became a thing you carried not because it hurt, but because you’d forgotten how to put it down. [196]

Her neighbor, Old Harkin, shuffled up the path, his boots kicking up dust that settled on the bouquet’s brittle petals. [213]

*"Still carving?"* he asked, though he knew. [219]

*"Still breathing?"* she replied, and he grunted, which was as close as either of them got to affection these days. [233]

Harkin tossed a rusted can onto the porch. *"Found this in the east field. Thought you’d want it."* [247]

Lena picked it up. The label was peeled away, but she recognized the weight—one of the old Mandate happiness tins, the kind they’d handed out like communion wafers. [268]

She shook it. Nothing. [271]

Of course. [273]

The real subversion had never been the performances, the whittling, the dramatic narration of peeling an orange or folding a sheet. [286]

It had been the refusal to fill the silence with lies. [292]

She stood abruptly, the bouquet slipping from her fingers, petals scattering like confetti for a funeral no one attended. [308]

Harkin watched as she climbed onto the porch railing, balanced there—a performer again, but this time without an audience. [325]

The wind howled through the turbines, a chorus of mechanical mourning. [333]

*"You’re not gonna jump,"* Harkin said, not a question. [340]

*"No,"* Lena admitted. *"But I’m going to scream."* [347]

And she did. [349]

Not a dramatic scream, not a performed one—just a raw, ugly sound, torn from the place where grief and relief had tangled into something unnameable. [368]

The turbines swallowed it whole. [372]

Harkin didn’t flinch. He just nodded, as if she’d finally said something worth hearing. [382]

When it was over, Lena stepped down, her blank face cracked just enough to let the light in. [393]

She picked up the bouquet, what was left of it, and tucked it into her pocket. [403]

*"Tomorrow,"* she said, *"I’ll teach you how to whittle."* [410]

Harkin’s eyes flickered—something like fear, something like hope. *"Why?"* [417]

*"Because,"* Lena said, and for the first time in years, she smiled, small and crooked, *"it’s easier to carry grief when your hands are busy."* [436]

The wind turbines turned. [439]

The farmhouse creaked. [442]

And in the space between, something like peace settled, not heavy, but light—light enough to hold. [455]

That night, Lena burned the happiness tin in the stove, and the fire didn’t even cough. [466]

The next morning, she split the last of the dried bouquet in half and gave one portion to Harkin. [479]

*"For when you’re done whittling,"* she said. [484]

He didn’t ask what it was for. [488]

Some things didn’t need narrating. [492]

They worked in silence, the knife moving, the wood falling away, the turbines turning above like slow, indifferent gods. [509]

And for the first time in a long time, the hush between them felt like a choice. [520]

Not an absence. [522]

A remaking. [524] </story>
