The knight had not spoken in seven years, not since the siege where the sky split like rotten silk and the enemy’s banners dissolved into moths. [31]
His armor, once polished to a mirror’s cruelty, now bore the greenish patina of neglect, the metal whispering when he moved—as if it remembered battles he’d tried to forget. [58]
He stood in the alchemical orchard, a greenhouse where no sun had ever risen, where glass panes wept condensation like slow tears and the air smelled of crushed silverleaf and something older, something *hungry*. [92]
The plants here didn’t grow; they *unfolded*, their roots tracing sigils in the soil, their petals pulsing with a light that wasn’t light but the echo of a color no human eye had named. [127]
His gauntleted fingers brushed a stem, and the blossom shivered, its edges curling into the shape of a half-remembered oath. [148]

Beneath a trellis of blackened ivy, he found the program for *The Marionette’s Vow*, its edges frayed, the ink bleeding into the paper like old wounds. [169]
The date was smudged—*tonight*, or *never*, or *always*—but the final act was circled in something darker than ink: *"The Knight Who Listens."* [188]
His breath hitched. [190]
He had been there, once. [193]
Or he would be. [195]
The program’s paper was warm, as if it had just been held by hands that weren’t his, and when he turned it over, the back bore a single word in a script that made his teeth ache: **UNSNAP**. [222]

A sound like a thousand needles dropping filled the greenhouse, the forgotten patterns in the air suddenly visible—threads of gold and rot, weaving between the plants, the glass, the *him* that had been and the *him* that might yet be. [256]
The knight’s fingers twitched. [259]
He knew this dance. [262]
The siege hadn’t been a battle; it had been a *performance*, and he had been the only audience member who refused to applaud. [281]
The moth-banners, the dissolving sky—it had all been a prompt, a murmured allegiance to something that fed on half-finished vows. [305]
And he had stayed silent. [308]

Now the threads pulsed, tightening around his wrists like manacles of light. [317]
The greenhouse wasn’t a place; it was a *moment*, stretched thin between what was and what could be, and the only way out was to— [334]

*Unsnap.* [336]

His fingers found the clasp of his gauntlet, the one he’d never removed, the one that had been welded shut by something more than fire. [356]
The metal groaned as the seal broke, and the air rushed in, carrying the scent of ozone and old roses, the taste of a promise finally kept. [379]
From the split in his glove spilled not blood, but *shadows*—thin, eager things that writhed toward the program, toward the threads, toward the *shape* of the knight he might have been if he’d ever dared to speak. [414]

The greenhouse exhaled. [417]
The plants stopped unfolding. [420]
The glass panes cleared for the first time in centuries, revealing not a sky, but a stage—empty, waiting, the curtains trembling. [437]
The knight’s voice, when it came, was the sound of a sword being drawn from a stone: *"I was there."* [448]
The threads *listened*. [450]
They rewove themselves around him, not as chains, but as wings. [457]

Outside—if there was an outside—the moths began to sing. [464]
The program in his hand flared once, bright as a dying star, before dissolving into his palm like sugar in rain. [479]
What remained was not a scar, but a *key*, its teeth shaped like the words he’d never said. [492]
The knight smiled. [494]
It was the first time in seven years, and it hurt like holy fire. [504]

Somewhere, a marionette’s strings went taut. [509]
Somewhere, a sky began to mend. [513]
And in the alchemical orchard, where time was a wound and possibility the blood, the knight finally understood: the allegiance had never been to the silence. [534]
It had been to the *shape* of the thing that came after. [540]

He stepped onto the stage. [543]
The curtains parted. [545]
The endless night held its breath. [548]
And for the first time, the knight was not withdrawn, but *invited*. [556]
The performance was his. [558]
The audience? [559]
The dark itself. [561]
