The disused railway station had been swallowing its own echoes for thirty years, its platforms choked with ivy and the stubborn ghosts of timetables no one followed anymore. [29]

Lena Voss arrived at dawn, her boots crunching on glass that had once been a ticket booth window, now just another casualty of the slow-motion earthquake that had hollowed out the town. [57]

She was a logistician by trade—elusive by necessity—specializing in the kind of aid that arrived just after the cameras left, when the real collapse began. [85]

Today, she carried a fragment of moon rock in her coat pocket, smooth as a river stone, cold as a promise. [104]

It had been a gift, or a bribe, or maybe a mistake—handed to her by a geologist in a bar in Reykjavik who’d whispered, *"This is how you catalyze things."* [130]

Lena didn’t believe in magic, but she believed in leverage, and the rock had a way of turning up in the right hands at the right time, passed along through improbable rumor chains like a secret no one could keep. [163]

She was here because the station was the last place anyone had seen Dr. Elias Carter, a virologist who’d allegedly synthesized a cure for loneliness—not the poetic kind, but the real, gnawing absence that made people stop answering doors. [201]

The town’s remaining inhabitants had taken to leaving offerings on the tracks: cans of peaches, half-burned candles, a child’s mitten. [220]

Lena’s method was simple: she made herself useful. [227]

By noon, she’d fixed the stationmaster’s broken radio, diagnosed the blacksmith’s rheumatism as dehydration, and convinced the baker to part with three loaves of bread in exchange for a story about a moon rock that could *"make the sky remember you."* [268]

The rumors did the rest. [272]

By dusk, a woman with a limp and a pocketful of train schedules slid onto the bench beside her. [284]

*"You’re looking for the doctor,"* she said, not asking. [291]

Lena grinned, the desperate jocularity of someone who’d long since accepted that the world ran on favors and lies. [308]

*"I’m looking for someone who understands reciprocity,"* she corrected. [318]

The woman—Mira, she called herself—led her to a freight car half-buried in kudzu, its door sealed with a padlock rusted shut. [336]

Inside, the air smelled of camphor and old paper. [343]

Dr. Carter was not a virologist. [348]

He was a forger, a poet, and, as it turned out, the last person in the world who knew how to read the ledgers of a dead railroad empire. [368]

*"The cure,"* he admitted, *"is just a list of names."* [378]

Every person who’d ever worked the line, every passenger who’d bought a ticket, every child who’d waved at a passing train—all bound by the unspoken contract of transit, the promise that someone, somewhere, was waiting. [416]

*"You give them the rock,"* Mira said, pressing the moon fragment back into Lena’s palm. [429]

*"You tell them it’s a key. You let them decide what it opens."* [439]

Lena understood. [441]

The cure wasn’t in the holding. [445]

It was in the passing. [447]

That night, she left the rock on the stationmaster’s desk with a note: *"For the next person who needs to believe in something."* [467]

By morning, the rumor had already changed—now it was a meteorite, now it was a saint’s bone, now it was the last piece of a bridge to somewhere else. [490]

Lena caught the first train out, or what passed for one: a flatbed truck with a hand-painted sign that read *"NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY."* [513]

The driver, a man with a gold tooth and a map drawn from memory, didn’t ask where she was headed. [532]

*"Wherever the tracks take us,"* he said, which was answer enough. [542]

She leaned out the window as the station shrank behind them, the ivy swallowing its nameplate whole. [556]

Somewhere, someone was picking up the moon rock, turning it over in their hands, wondering what to trade for it. [575]

Lena smiled. [577]

The world was a ledger, and for once, she wasn’t the only one keeping score. [587]

The train—or whatever it was—rolled on, and for the first time in years, she didn’t feel like she was running. [606]

Maybe that was the cure. [610]

Maybe it was just the motion. [614]

Either way, she wasn’t lonely. [618]

Not today. [620] </story>
