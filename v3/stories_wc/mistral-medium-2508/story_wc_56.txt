The barge cut through the twilight canal like a blade through old parchment, its hull groaning with the weight of forgotten things. [21]

Liora crouched at the stern, her fingers tracing the brass edges of an antique pocket sundial—its face pitted with age, its gnomon bent as if resisting time itself. [42]

She had salvaged it from a sinking houseboat two towns back, not for its value, but because the way it caught the light reminded her of the moment she first doubted her father’s stories. [68]

The radio beside her hissed static, the morning broadcast long dead, leaving only the silence of a world that had moved on without her. [87]

Liora wasn’t a thief, though she’d been called worse; she was an errant legend seeker, chasing the bones of truths others had buried under layers of lies. [109]

The sundial’s shadow stretched long and thin across her palm, defying the hour—it was always noon somewhere, her father used to say, when the lies were brightest. [130]

She turned it over, revealing the inscription: *"The past is a map, but only fools trust the legend."* [143]

Her training had honed her instincts, not for combat or theft, but for the architecture of lies—the way they were framed, the way they sagged under their own weight. [163]

The canal’s surface rippled as another barge passed, its wake sloshing against the hull, and for a moment, the water’s reflection showed her not as she was, but as she might have been: steady, unbroken. [186]

She pocketed the sundial and reached into her satchel, pulling out a yellowed ledger—her father’s, filled with coordinates of places that didn’t exist, or so she’d thought until she found the first one. [210]

The ink had bled like old wounds, but the numbers were thoughtfully clear, as if he’d known she’d need them when the world’s noise faded to this: the lap of water, the creak of wood, the absence of answers. [236]

Ahead, the canal split—one path led to the docks, where the auctioneers would pay handsomely for relics like the sundial; the other veered into the marshes, where the water whispered secrets instead of reflecting them. [263]

She steered toward the marshes. [266]

The air thickened with the scent of wet earth and decay, the kind of quiet that made a person’s thoughts louder than they’d like. [283]

Liora had spent years chasing the lie her father had built around his life, only to realize the truth wasn’t in the destinations he’d marked, but in the spaces between them—the silences, the detours, the things left unsalvaged. [313]

The barge nudged against a half-sunk piling, its wood slick with algae, and she tied off the rope with practiced ease. [328]

In the distance, a heron took flight, its wings cutting the mist like a blade, and for the first time in years, she didn’t feel like she was following a trail. [349]

She felt like she was standing at the edge of one. [355]

The sundial grew warm in her pocket, as if reacting to the proximity of something unseen, and she pulled it out again, holding it up to the pale morning light. [375]

The shadow didn’t point north. [378]

It pointed inward. [380]

Liora exhaled, the breath curling into the damp air like smoke, and understood: the lies weren’t the architecture. [391]

They were the scaffolding. [393]

And she’d been climbing the wrong structure all along. [398]

The radio crackled suddenly, a voice breaking through the static—*"…repeat, this is the last broadcast…"*—before dissolving into silence again. [414]

She didn’t need the warning. [417]

The marshes had already told her what she needed to know: some things weren’t meant to be found. [430]

They were meant to be let go. [433]

Liora dropped the ledger into the water, the pages spreading like lily pads before sinking into the depths, and the canal swallowed the past without a ripple. [453]

The sundial, though, she kept. [457]

Not as a relic, but as a reminder: hindsight wasn’t about seeing clearly. [465]

It was about learning to squint. [469]

She turned the barge back toward the docks, the weight in her chest lighter than it had been in years, the water’s reflection now showing her as she was—errant, unsteady, but no longer lost. [492]

The first auctioneer would offer her gold for the sundial, the second would call it cursed, and the third would recognize it for what it was: a key that didn’t fit any lock she’d find in this lifetime. [519]

She’d smile at them all. [523]

Then she’d walk away. [526]

The mist thickened as the sun rose, burning off the last of the night’s doubts, and Liora steered into the light, the canal’s path ahead as uncertain as it had ever been. [548]

But for the first time, that didn’t bother her. [554]

The radio stayed silent. [557]

The water kept moving. [560]

And so did she. [563]
