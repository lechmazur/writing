The sea-foam recollectionist knelt in the heart of the geode, her fingers brushing the crater glass embedded in the iridescent walls like forgotten stars. [26]

Each shard hummed with a memory not her own—fragments of laughter, the salt-sting of tears—transliterating emotions into colors only she could decipher. [46]

She had come before memory faded, before the paths between what was and what might have been dissolved into the cave’s opalescent mist. [67]

A migrating bird had led her here, its scattered seeds marking the way like breadcrumbs of possibility, each one whispering *conjecture*: *What if the missing pieces weren’t lost, but hidden?* [92]

The recollectionist plucked a seed from the damp crystal floor, rolling it between her palms until it pulsed with the same blue-green hue as the tide’s regret. [113]

She remembered the fisherman’s daughter who’d drowned at seventeen, her final breath a question no one answered—until now, where the cave’s walls shimmered with the girl’s unspoken fear of the open sea. [139]

The crater glass wasn’t just a relic; it was a map. [146]

Each fracture traced a life’s diverging moments, the choices that split like river deltas into the unknown. [160]

She pressed her ear to the largest shard, listening as it sang of a merchant who’d turned left at the crossroads instead of right, his fortune—and his name—erased by the choice. [183]

The cave breathed around her, its cheerful gloom a lullaby for the curious and the bereft. [194]

She wondered if the missing paths were the universe’s way of being kind, or if they were cracks in something far more fragile. [212]

A seed sprouted in her cupped hands, its roots weaving through her skin like threads of a story half-told. [228]

The bird circled above, its wings casting shifting shadows that spelled out *hurry* in a language older than words. [243]

Time was a thief here, and the recollectionist was running out of it. [252]

She gathered the crater glass into her satchel, each piece clinking against the others like bones in a diviner’s bag. [269]

One shard cut her thumb, and she gasped—not from pain, but because the blood that welled up glowed the same iridescent blue as the cave’s heart. [290]

*Of course,* she thought. *The missing pieces were never gone. They were inside her all along.* [305]

The cave’s walls rippled, the memories within the glass surging toward her like a wave breaking on shore. [320]

She let them in. [323]

The fisherman’s daughter sighed in relief, her fear finally named. [330]

The merchant’s lost fortune glittered in the corner of her eye, a road not taken but not forgotten. [342]

The recollectionist laughed, the sound echoing through the geode like wind through a seashell. [354]

She understood now: the paths disappeared so new ones could be found. [364]

The bird alighted on her shoulder, its beak nudging her toward the cave’s mouth where the world waited, brighter for the shadows it held. [382]

She stepped forward, the crater glass light in her satchel, her heart heavier with the weight of a thousand half-remembered lives. [402]

As the iridescent cave dimmed behind her, she whispered to the seeds still clinging to her sleeves: *"Next time, I’ll follow you farther."* [422]

Outside, the sea foam curled around her ankles like an old friend, and for the first time, she didn’t wonder about the paths she couldn’t see. [441]

She knew. [443]

Somewhere, a door was opening. [446]

And she would be the one to walk through it. [450]

The recollectionist adjusted her satchel, the crater glass warm against her hip, and set off toward the horizon where the sky met the sea in a line as thin as the edge of a memory. [475]

Behind her, the geode sealed itself with a contented sigh, its iridescent walls holding the echoes of her laughter like a secret kept just long enough to be worth telling. [498]

The migrating bird took flight, its seeds tumbling into the wind, each one a question mark, a promise, a beginning. [517]

She didn’t look back. [520]

The missing pieces had found their way home. [525]

And so, at last, had she. [528]
