The last *Hesperornis* stretched its vestigial wings, the bones groaning like old ship timber as it perched on the brass sundial’s edge. [19]
The artifact, atomically reflective, cast fractured sunlight across the tidal library’s floating shelves, where books pulsed with the rhythm of the clouds below. [37]
Lior had spent three lifetimes here, after the reincarnation memory surfaced—fragments of a past where his kind had hunted these birds to silence. [56]
Now, he was their contemporary by accident, a scholar of extinct things who outlived them all. [69]

The sundial’s shadow crept toward the twelfth hour, and the stone circle at the library’s heart began to hum, a sound like grinding teeth or a planet turning. [85]
Lior pressed his palm to the nearest tome, its pages damp with mist, and whispered, *"How do you coexist with a ghost that remembers you?"* [102]
The *Hesperornis* tilted its head, black eyes glinting—not with recognition, but with the same brittle awakening that had seized Lior when he first touched the library’s threshold. [121]
It wasn’t rebirth. [123]
It was the slow unraveling of solitude into something sharper. [128]

The shelves shifted with the tide, books rearranging themselves by some unseen logic, their spines crackling with static. [142]
Lior had learned to read the patterns: the *Hesperornis* always appeared when the hum peaked, when the sundial’s reflection split into seven shards. [159]
He called it *the translator’s hour*, though he had yet to decipher what was being said. [170]
The bird’s claws clicked against brass, a Morse code of extinction. [177]

*"You’re not here to judge me,"* Lior murmured, watching the sundial’s needle tremble. [186]
The *Hesperornis* lunged suddenly, not at him, but at its own reflection in the metal, beak striking the atomically perfect surface. [202]
The impact sent a shockwave through the library—the hum swelled, the shelves groaned, and for a heartbeat, the air smelled of wet feathers and gunpowder. [220]
Lior staggered, his fingers brushing a book that hadn’t been there a second before. [229]
Its title burned into his skin: *On the Independence of Forgotten Things*. [236]

He opened it. [238]
The pages were mirrors. [240]
Not of his face, but of the *Hesperornis* as it had been: a flock darkening the sky, a species unbroken. [251]
The reflection pulsed, and Lior understood—this was the translation. [259]
Isolation wasn’t the absence of others. [262]
It was the weight of being the only one who remembered. [267]

The bird screeched, a sound like tearing parchment, and the stone circle’s hum climbed to a pitch that made Lior’s teeth ache. [282]
He grabbed the sundial, its brass warm as blood, and held it up like a shield. [291]
The reflection split again—this time, showing him the library from outside, a jewel-box floating above the clouds, untouched by time. [307]
*"We’re not ghosts,"* he realized. [311]
*"We’re the ones who refused to stay dead."* [315]

The *Hesperornis* plucked a feather from its breast and dropped it onto the sundial. [323]
The metal drank the feather in, and the hum softened into a purr. [330]
Lior exhaled. [332]
The book in his hands dissolved into mist, but the lesson remained, etched into his ribs: to translate isolation into independence was to stop asking for forgiveness. [350]

The tide receded. [352]
The shelves stilled. [354]
The *Hesperornis* stepped onto Lior’s outstretched arm, its weight familiar, like a debt repaid. [364]
Together, they watched the sundial’s shadow complete its arc. [370]
The stone circle fell silent. [373]

Below them, the clouds parted, revealing a world that had moved on without either species. [382]
Lior smiled. [384]
For the first time, the brittle awakening didn’t hurt. [389]
It was just the cost of being alive. [393]

The *Hesperornis* took flight, not toward the past, but into the wind. [401]
Lior let it go. [404]
The library’s doors, which had never opened before, creaked ajar. [411]
He stepped through. [413]
The air smelled of rain and possibility. [416]
Somewhere, a clock began to chime. [420]
