The alchemical orchard greenhouse stood as a wound in the world, its glass panes weeping frost even as the air inside hummed with the slow breath of sleeping poisons. [30]

Liora had been dead for seventy-three winters when she first returned—not as memory, but as hunger. [45]

She moved through the greenhouse like smoke through a keyhole, her ashen-veil trailing over the blackened vines, each touch leaving behind a bloom of silver-throated nightshade. [65]

The carved stone bead had been her dowry once, cool and heavy as a vow in her living palm; now it rested in the soil beneath the oldest tree, pulsing faintly, calling her back. [88]

She had not come to haunt. [92]

The debt was older than the orchard itself: a promise made in the hush of winter-cracked fields, when her lover, Vesper, had pressed the bead into her hand and whispered, *"Wake me when the world forgets its name."* [118]

But Vesper had died first, their bones dissolved into the greenhouse’s alchemical loam, and the bead had drunk their last breath like a thief. [137]

Liora appeared only in cameos—there, in the curl of a dead leaf’s shadow; there, in the way the moonlight split like a knife through the glass. [155]

Each appearance cost her. [158]

The living called it ghosting, this flicker of presence, but to Liora it was excavation: she clawed her way into the world through the bead’s resonance, her love for Vesper the chisel, her grief the mallet. [185]

The orchard’s keeper, a gaunt woman with hands like cracked bark, did not fear her. [196]

"Again?" the keeper muttered one evening, as Liora’s fingers brushed the bead’s buried weight, sending a tremor through the soil. [213]

Liora’s voice was the sound of petals crumbling. *"Almost."* [218]

The keeper sighed, pressing a vial of black sap into the earth. "You’re lovingly venomous, you know that? [230]

This place thrives on poison, and still you drain it dry." [237]

Liora smiled—a gesture like wind through dead branches. [243]

She had spent lifetimes learning the shape of this debt: how to unspool her essence into the bead’s hunger, how to let it sing Vesper’s name back into the roots of the world. [265]

The greenhouse shivered. [267]

Glass groaned as the oldest tree split open, its heart a cavity of glowing veins, and from its depths rose Vesper—not as they had been in life, but as the orchard remembered them: half-skeleton, half-sapling, their ribs caged in thorned blossoms. [298]

Liora reached for them. [300]

The bead between her fingers burned like a swallowed star. [305]

*"You woke me,"* Vesper murmured, their voice the creak of bending boughs. [312]

*"I always do,"* she answered, and the greenhouse exhaled around them, the air thick with the scent of rotting roses and something sweeter, something like the first breath after drowning. [333]

The keeper watched from the shadows, her eyes wet. [339]

She knew the rules of this place: debts paid in resonance were never clean. [346]

Liora’s veil began to unravel, thread by thread, dissolving into the steam rising from Vesper’s outstretched hands. [360]

The bead crumbled. [362]

Its song died in the soil, but the orchard held the echo, and for a moment—just a moment—the endless night above the greenhouse thinned, revealing a slash of dawn like a wound healing backward. [389]

Then the glass panes sealed shut again. [393]

The keeper knelt, pressing her palm to the earth where the bead had been. [399]

She would plant something new here. [402]

Something that remembered. [404]

Liora was gone, but the orchard hummed louder now, its vines heavy with fruit that pulsed like a heartbeat. [418]

Vesper stood among the trees, their skeletal fingers tracing the names Liora had carved into the bark over decades: *here*, *here*, *here*. [434]

The keeper did not ask if they would stay. [438]

Some awakenings were not meant to last. [442]

She left them to the hush of the greenhouse, to the slow, loving venom of the nightshade blooming in the places Liora had touched. [458]

Outside, the fields lay winter-cracked and silent, but the orchard breathed, and the debt was paid. [470]

For now. [472]

The bead’s resonance would return, as all hungers did. [478]

And Liora—wherever she was—would answer. [482]

Again. [483]
