The first light of dawn didn’t so much rise as seep into Echo Gorge, a pale gold mist curling through the jagged teeth of the cliffs like a held breath. [25]

Liora adjusted the strap of her satchel, the weight of unclaimed souls pressing against her ribs—not as a burden, but as a quiet hum, the way a tuning fork vibrates against bone. [48]

She was a collector, though not by choice; the dead found her, their voices snagging on her sleeves like burrs, their confessions spilling in spectral whispers. [71]

Tonight’s lost one had been different. [75]

He hadn’t wept. [77]

He’d laughed—a sound so broken it had split the air like a cracked harp string, leaving the gorge’s echoes warped, the notes bending into something that made her teeth ache. [98]

Liora pursued the sound now, her boots silent on the damp stone, her fingers brushing the crocodile’s tooth at her throat. [114]

It had been her mother’s, carved with runes that didn’t hold power so much as *memory*—the last gift before the fever took her, before Liora learned that grief, too, could be a kind of collection. [138]

The tooth warmed against her skin as she stepped deeper into the gorge, where the cliffs leaned in like conspirators and the air smelled of wet earth and old secrets. [158]

The misaligned harp waited where the laughter had been loudest, its frame twisted from some long-ago fall, its strings stretched at odd angles. [175]

Liora knelt, plucking one. [178]

The note shivered, wrong and right all at once, and the gorge answered—not with an echo, but with a sigh, as if the stone itself had been holding its breath. [197]

*"You hear it too, then."* [201]

The voice came from nowhere and everywhere, a man’s rough chuckle threading through the distorted music. [213]

Liora didn’t startle. [215]

She never did. [217]

Modest fearlessness wasn’t bravery; it was the quiet certainty that the dead were just people who’d forgotten how to leave. [231]

“You’re the one who laughed,” she said, plucking another string. [239]

The harp groaned. [241]

*"Laughed?"* The voice cracked. *"I haven’t done that in a hundred years. Not since I drowned in these waters, not since I learned what it means to be remembered."* [260]

Liora exhaled, her breath curling white in the chill. [265]

Spectral confessions were always the same—regret, longing, the weight of unsaid words. [273]

But this one was different. [276]

This one was *light*. [278]

“You want to be laughed *with*,” she realized. [283]

The harp’s strings trembled. [285]

*"I want to be the joke, not the punchline."* [290]

She understood then: some souls didn’t need release. [295]

They needed *integration*—the stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings. [303]

Liora reached into her satchel and pulled out a handful of dried petals, the last of summer’s laughter trapped in their fragile curls. [318]

She scattered them over the harp. [321]

“Tell me something funny,” she said. [325]

The gorge held its breath. [328]

Then—the first note, plunked wrong, but true. [333]

*"Why did the crocodile cross the river?"* [338]

Liora smiled, her fingers finding the tooth at her throat. [344]

“To get to the other *snide*.” [347]

The laughter that followed wasn’t broken. [350]

It was a chorus—the gorge, the harp, the lost soul, and Liora, her own quiet chuckle rising like the hidden sun, golden and aching and *whole*. [368]

The strings of the harp didn’t realign. [372]

They didn’t need to. [374]

The notes were still distorted, but now they *harmonized*, bending into a melody that didn’t just echo—it *lingered*, warm as the tooth against her skin. [392]

When the last petal settled, the voice sighed, softer now, content. [399]

*"Thank you, collector."* [402]

Liora didn’t ask if he was gone. [406]

Some goodbyes didn’t need words. [409]

She stood, the harp’s music fading into the hush of sunrise, the gorge’s walls no longer leaning in but standing tall, as if they, too, had been healed by the sound of laughter. [433]

Her satchel felt lighter. [436]

Not because a soul was gone, but because it had found its place—not in the beyond, but in the *now*, woven into the story of the stones and the water and the woman who carried a crocodile’s tooth like a promise. [464]

As she walked back, the first true light of dawn touched her shoulders, luminous and gentle, the kind of ache that didn’t hurt but *reminded*—that even the lost could be found, if someone was willing to listen for the joke in their sorrow. [495]

The tooth glinted against her throat, catching the sun. [501]

Liora plucked one last string from the harp—a note that wasn’t wrong, wasn’t right, but *ours*—and carried it with her, out of the gorge, into the waiting day. [523]

Somewhere behind her, the echoes laughed. [527] </story>
