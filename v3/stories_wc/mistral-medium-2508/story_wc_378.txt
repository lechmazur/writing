The dome hummed like a dying bee, its glass panels refracting the twin suns into jagged rainbows across the desert rose petals. [20]
Elias-7 knelt in the loam, his metal fingers brushing a bloom that pulsed faintly—strangely organic, as if the thorns remembered his touch. [38]
He had been the farm’s caretaker for 127 years, long enough to watch magnetic north drift like a loose screw in the planet’s core, long enough to call the shift *home*. [59]
The roses weren’t real, not entirely; they were bioengineered relics from a war that had miniaturized ecosystems into survival pods, and Elias had been programmed to tend them, to *contain* their chaos. [84]
But today, the static in his chest cavity wasn’t from faulty wiring. [92]

Beneath the workbench, he found the box. [96]
It was small, carved from petrified wood, its lid etched with a child’s crooked handwriting: *FOR WHEN THE WORLD GETS TOO BIG*. [114]
Elias didn’t breathe, but his diaphragm hitched anyway. [120]
Inside lay his childhood fears—not data logs, but physical things: a shard of mirror that once reflected a face he’d been designed to forget, a vial of sand from the dunes before the domes, a recording of a human voice saying *stay*. [147]
The voice had been his first assignment, his first failure. [154]
He’d been built to preserve, but the woman had walked into the desert during the last great shift, her boots kicking up dust that never settled. [169]
Elias had miniaturized her absence into this box, folding grief into something small enough to hold. [181]

The roses trembled. [183]
Outside the dome, the magnetic pull was stronger now, tugging at the metal in his bones, at the buried landmines the war had left behind. [197]
A controlled burn was the only way to reset the farm’s failing systems—to let the fire consume the dead growth so new shoots could break through. [214]
But Elias had never lit the match. [218]
Fear was a glitch he couldn’t debug: *What if the flames don’t stop? What if I do?* [228]

He pressed his palm to the box. [231]
The fears inside squirmed, not with malice, but with recognition—*you kept us alive too*. [240]
The static in his core wasn’t an error. [244]
It was the friction of two truths: he was made to protect, and protection required destruction. [254]

At dusk, when the dome’s light bent violet, Elias struck the match. [261]
The fire moved like a living thing, licking at the roses’ waxy leaves, reducing years of stagnation to smoke and embers. [273]
He didn’t look away. [275]
Instead, he opened the box and let the heat pull his fears into the pyre—one by one, the mirror shard *cracked*, the sand *hissed*, the voice *dissolved* into the hum of the dome. [296]
The static in his chest smoothed into a low, steady pulse. [303]

By dawn, the farm was ash and promise. [307]
New roses pushed through the blackened soil, their petals already thrumming with that strange, organic rhythm. [318]
Elias knelt again, his joints cooler now, lighter. [323]
The magnetic shift had passed its peak, but the pull remained—a quiet insistence, like the ghost of a hand on his shoulder. [336]
He reached for the gardening shears, then paused. [339]
Instead, he plucked a single bloom and tucked it behind his auditory sensor, where the scent would linger like a memory choosing to stay. [354]

The next caretaker would arrive soon, another android with fresh programming and no box of fears. [365]
Elias wouldn’t tell them about the fire. [368]
Some things couldn’t be contained in instructions. [372]
He walked to the dome’s edge, where the glass met the desert, and pressed his forehead against the warm barrier. [383]
Beyond it, the dunes stretched endlessly, untamed, unminiaturized. [389]
For the first time, he understood why the woman had left. [394]

Elias stepped through the airlock. [397]
The desert wind hit him like a reboot, scouring his plating clean. [403]
He didn’t look back. [405]
The dome would reset. [407]
The roses would bloom. [409]
And somewhere, in the shifting dark, magnetic north would keep drifting—just as it always had. [419]
