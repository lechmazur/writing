The carousel had stopped years ago, its brass horses frozen mid-gallop above the kinetic lagoon, their paint chipped by wind that never ceased. [26]
Lira crouched on the rusted platform, her fingers tracing the edges of a disposable camera wheel—its film long exposed to the wrong kind of light. [45]
She had been nineteen when she first climbed here, back when the gears still groaned and the lagoon’s surface shimmered with the reflections of a sky that wasn’t hers. [70]
Now, at thirty-seven or possibly forty-three (time had frayed like the hem of her coat), she collected fragments of overheard stories the way others gathered shells. [96]
A merchant’s boast about a lost city, a child’s sob over a dropped kite, the hollow laugh of a woman who’d sold her shadow—each snippet coiled in her ribs, heavy as the camera wheel. [125]

The lagoon wasn’t water but something thicker, a suspension of memory and mist that rippled only when the wind hit just right. [143]
Lira had learned to read its surface: the way it dimpled where her younger self had once stood, arms outstretched, daring the world to let her fall. [163]
That girl had wanted to be an architect of clouds, to build bridges between the floating islands where the rich lived in glass towers. [181]
Now, Lira scavenged their discarded things—half-melted candlesticks, letters with the ink washed out by rain, the occasional camera wheel with ghosts trapped in its frames. [206]

She pressed the wheel to her temple, as if the plastic could conduct the past. [216]
The first photo was always the same: her own face, but not as she remembered it. [227]
This version of Lira wore a smirk, her hair still dark, her hands clutching a blueprint rolled tight as a secret. [242]
The next frame showed the carousel mid-collapse, its poles snapping like bones, and then—nothing. [255]
Just the white static of a future that had never arrived.

A voice cut through the fractured stillness: *"You’re holding it wrong."* [268]
She didn’t turn. [269]
The ghost of her—no, *a* ghost, some iteration she’d outlived—stood at the lagoon’s edge, her boots sinking slightly into the mist. [285]
This one was twenty-five, maybe, with a satchel full of stolen tools and a bruise blooming on her jaw from the last time she’d asked for more than she was owed. [307]
*"You think if you collect enough pieces, you can bargain your way back?"* the ghost asked, tossing a pebble into the lagoon. [324]
The ripples spelled out a word: *coward*.

Lira’s thumb found the camera’s advance lever. [334]
*"I’m not here to go back,"* she said. [339]
*"I’m here to make sure she doesn’t follow me."* [345]
The ghost’s laughter was the sound of a gear grinding to a halt. [353]
*"You don’t get to decide that. None of us do."* [359]
She pointed at the lagoon, where the water—if it was water—had begun to churn. [369]
Shapes emerged: a dozen Liras, each at a different age, each holding a different failure. [380]
The architect with her crumpled blueprints. [383]
The thief with empty pockets. [385]
The girl who’d loved a woman who loved the sky more than her. [392]
Their voices overlapped, a chorus of regret: *"You left me behind. You left us all."* [405]

Lira raised the camera wheel like a shield. [410]
*"I know,"* she whispered. [412]
The lagoon stilled. [413]
The ghosts didn’t fade, but their edges blurred, dissolving into the mist like ink in rain. [423]
Only the twenty-five-year-old remained, her outline wavering. [430]
*"Next time,"* she said, *"bring something better than a camera."* [438]
Then she, too, was gone, leaving only the weight of the wheel in Lira’s palm. [448]

She advanced the film one last time. [452]
The final frame was blank. [454]
Not white, not static—just empty, like the space after a held breath. [461]
Lira tucked the camera into her coat and stepped to the lagoon’s edge. [470]
Below, the clouds shifted, revealing the skeletal remains of a bridge she’d never finished building. [480]
She jumped. [481]
Not to fall, but to see if the lagoon would catch her differently this time. [491]
The wind rushed past, carrying the scent of ozone and old carnivals. [498]
For a moment, she was weightless. [501]
For a moment, it was enough. [504]

When she hit the surface, the lagoon didn’t ripple. [511]
It *remembered*. [512]
Hands—her hands, all of them—reached up to pull her under. [520]
Lira didn’t struggle. [521]
She let the past have her, just for now. [525]
Just until the carousel started again. [529] </story>
