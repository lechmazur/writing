The embalming table was cold beneath Lira’s palms, its porcelain surface streaked with the ghosts of names no one had bothered to carve. [18]

She wasn’t supposed to be here—not in the prep room of *Holloway & Sons*, not at three a.m., not with her father’s stolen ledger tucked into her coat like a second heartbeat. [38]

The ledger listed every mark he’d ever swindled: widows who’d traded deeds for false promises, politicians who’d bought silence with signed confessions, even a border guard who’d exchanged asylum papers for a vial of “holy water” (vinegar, dyed blue). [68]

Lira had spent years decoding the math of his cons—the way he balanced risk against desperation, how he turned trust into a lever. [83]

Tonight, she needed the inverse: the equation for a trade that didn’t rot. [91]

Her fingers brushed the ink pot on the counter—a squat, tarnished thing, its silver lid etched with a serpent eating its own tail. [105]

“For the dead who won’t stay buried,” Mr. Holloway had muttered when she’d asked about it years ago, his breath reeking of formaldehyde and bad decisions. [120]

She pried it open. The ink inside wasn’t dry. It *moved*, thick as blood, swirling when she tilted the pot like it was alive. [132]

Lira dipped a stolen nib, then hesitated. [136]

The ledger’s last entry was fresh: *Minister Veyra—12 asylum slots, paid in advance. Delivery: midnight.* [148]

Her father had promised safe passage to a dozen refugees, then vanished with their money. The minister’s men would come at dawn to collect their “guests.” [164]

Lira knew the math here. Twelve lives for one ledger. A fair trade? [171]

She wrote the minister’s name on a scrap of mortuary paper, then touched the ink pot’s rim. The liquid *pulled*, sucking the name into its depths, the letters dissolving like sugar in tea. [188]

The pot warmed in her hands. [191]

She wrote another name. Another. Each vanished the same way, the ink liquefying the rigid lines of debt and deceit. [203]

By the seventh name, the air smelled like ozone and old parchment. [209]

The door creaked. Lira spun, knocking over a tray of scalpels. [215]

A girl no older than twelve stood there, her dark eyes too sharp for someone who’d just crossed a border in a coffin. [227]

“You’re the con artist’s kid,” the girl said in accented trade-tongue. “The one who counts things.” [236]

Lira’s throat tightened. “I don’t—” [239]

“You do.” The girl stepped forward, her shoes leaving wet prints. “You count what’s missing.” [247]

The ink pot hummed. Lira looked down. The last five names were gone. Only seven remained. [256]

The girl pointed at the ledger. “That’s how many they’ll kill when they find it empty.” [264]

Lira’s pulse spiked. The math was wrong. Twelve lives for one ledger was a lie—it had always been twelve for *her*. [276]

Her father’s final con: leaving her to clean up the mess, to decide who got to breathe. [285]

She grabbed the girl’s wrist. “Help me.” [288]

They worked fast. The girl whispered names, Lira wrote. The ink took them all, the pot growing heavier, its silver darkening like a bruise. [303]

When the last name vanished, the girl exhaled. “Now what?” [308]

Lira didn’t know. The ledger was blank. The ink pot was full. The minister’s men would breach the door soon. [319]

Then the pot *shattered*. [322]

Black liquid surged across the table, seeping into the ledger, the walls, the cracks between the tiles. The room *softened*—the embalming fluid turned to water, the locks on the coffins clicked open, the death certificates blurred into blank paper. [345]

The girl laughed, high and wild. “You broke it.” [350]

Not the pot. The rules. The rigid lines of who owed what to whom. [357]

Lira’s hands trembled. She’d wanted fairness, but this was chaos. This was her father’s greatest con: teaching her that the only fair trade was the one that refused to be counted. [376]

Sirens wailed in the distance. The minister’s men. Or the police. Or both. [383]

The girl grabbed her arm. “We go now.” [386]

Lira glanced at the ledger—pristine, useless. Then at the ink staining her fingers, still warm. [394]

She left it all behind. [396]

The funeral home didn’t stop them. The night didn’t either. [401]

Somewhere beyond the city, the girl pressed a folded paper into Lira’s palm. A map. Or a confession. Or both. [412]

“Next time,” the girl said, “we count *together*.” [417]

Lira didn’t answer. She was too busy learning the shape of a world where debt could drown—and what grew in the wreckage. [430]

The ink on her skin didn’t fade. Neither did the weight of the ledger she’d burned in her mind. [440]

But for the first time, the numbers didn’t add up to her. [446]

They added up to *them*. [448]

And that, she thought, as the border lights faded behind them, might be the only math that mattered. [459]

The ink pot’s serpent had no end. Neither, now, did she. [465] </story>
