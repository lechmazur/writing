The fortress of Veythar had stood for centuries, its stone walls now draped in creeping vines and blossoms that glowed faintly in the fading light—petals like embers caught in slow motion. [31]

Liora, a fireworks designer with no fixed home, had arrived at dusk, her boots kicking up dust that smelled of crushed lavender and old gunpowder. [53]

She chanted as she walked, a habit born of loneliness, her voice weaving between the hum of bees and the distant creak of the fortress gates: *"Sparks rise, though the sky forgets."* [75]

The villagers had told her the fortress was cursed—no stars had shone above it in a decade, not since the last ruler vanished—but Liora only saw potential in the hollow towers, perfect for launching her designs. [103]

Her fingers brushed the kerosene rag knot in her pocket, a gift from a fire spinner she’d met in the salt flats, who’d whispered, *"Light isn’t just for seeing. It’s for remembering."* [133]

That night, the hush was thick enough to chew, the air heavy with the scent of damp earth and something sharper—fear, maybe, or the metallic tang of old wishes. [155]

Liora climbed the highest tower, her breath steady, her mind filtering the darkness through ambient awareness: the way the wind curled around the battlements, the way the blooms below pulsed like a slow, silent heartbeat. [183]

At the tower’s peak, she found the mosaic. [187]

Not a picture, but a note—hundreds of shattered tiles arranged into words only visible when the light hit just right: *"Defy the weight."* [204]

Her pulse quickened. [206]

She pulled the kerosene knot from her pocket, struck flint, and let the rag bloom into flame, casting jagged shadows that made the mosaic’s message writhe across the stone. [229]

The villagers would call it madness, lighting fires where the sky had turned its back. But Liora had spent her life chasing the kind of light that refused to be smothered. [252]

She worked quickly, binding gunpowder and colored salts into a spiral, her chant shifting to something older, something that thrummed in her bones: *"Up, though the dark says stay. Burn, though the wind says no."* [283]

The first rocket hissed into the starless void, exploding into a shower of violet and gold—a fleeting constellation, defiant and bright. [302]

The fortress trembled. [304]

Not from the explosion, but from the ground itself, as if the earth had been holding its breath. Then, one by one, the blooms below flared brighter, their glow climbing the walls like vines of liquid fire. [330]

The villagers emerged from their homes, their faces upturned, their breaths caught. A child pointed. *"Look—"* [343]

Above the fortress, where there had been nothing, a single star flickered, then another, until the sky was a net of silver threads, trembling back into existence. [365]

Liora laughed, her voice raw with smoke and wonder. [371]

She had come to defy the gravity of hopelessness, but the fortress—no, the *world*—had been waiting for the same thing. [388]

The mosaics’ message shimmered in the new starlight: *"Defy the weight."* [396]

She tucked the kerosene knot back into her pocket, its purpose fulfilled, and began the descent, her chant softer now, a promise rather than a plea. [416]

By dawn, the villagers would ask how she’d done it. She’d smile and say, *"I just gave the dark something to push against."* [435]

But the truth was, she had simply listened—to the hush, to the blooms, to the way the wind carried the echoes of old fires—and let the answer filter through her, like light through stained glass. [460]

The fortress would remember her, not as a savior, but as the one who had walked in chanting and left the sky singing. [478]

And somewhere, a fire spinner would hear the story and nod, knowing the rag knot had done its work. [494]

Liora walked on at dusk the next evening, her pockets lighter, her steps sure, the villagers’ cheers fading behind her like the last crackle of spent fireworks. [520]

The world was heavier than it had been yesterday. But so was she. [528]

And that was how you defied gravity. [532]

One spark at a time. [535]
