The terrace stretched like a half-remembered dream, its stone balustrades slick with rain, the prism parapet refracting the dying light into fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones. [31]

Liora stood motionless, her fingers brushing the cool glass of a pocket mirror—her twelfth that month, each borrowed or stolen, each whispered to in the hush before the cathedral bells began their evening toll. [59]

She was the city’s elusive mirage painter, though no one called her that to her face; they only spoke of her in the breath between songs, when the wind carried the scent of wet earth and the last notes of children’s rhymes from the alleyways below. [98]

Her gift was not in pigments but in persuasion: she coaxed mirrors to show not reflections, but possibilities—the lover who might return, the child who might live, the door that might open if only you dared to turn the handle. [138]

Tonight’s client had paid in a heartbeat. [143]

Not a real one—those were illegal, even here, where the black market thrived in the spaces between laws—but a borrowed one, pressed into her palm like a coin: a pulse stolen from a sleeping soldier, still warm, still thrumming with the ghost of his fear. [175]

*"Show me my son as he could be,"* the woman had begged, her voice raw, her hands clutching a tattered lullaby book. [190]

Liora had taken the heartbeat and the book, her perceptively calm gaze never flickering as she traced the coded lullabies in the margins—children’s songs with notes bent just slightly sharp, the way only the desperate could hear them. [220]

Now, on the terrace, she hummed the first line, her breath curling into the spring air as the mirror in her hand clouded, then cleared to reveal a boy with his mother’s eyes, laughing as he chased fireflies that weren’t there yet. [251]

The woman would see this. [254]

She would weep. [256]

She would pay again. [258]

But the mirror’s truth was a fragile thing, and Liora knew the cost: every possibility she painted stole from another. [275]

The soldier whose heartbeat she’d borrowed would wake with his ribs aching, his dreams full of a child he’d never met. [292]

The cathedral bells began to stir in their towers, their first chime still unspoken but coming, inevitable as dawn. [307]

Liora exhaled, her grace not in movement but in stillness—the way she let the mirror slip from her fingers before it could show her own face, her own possibilities. [329]

She had tried that once. [333]

The glass had shown her a terrace just like this one, but empty. [340]

No rainbows. [342]

No songs. [344]

No borrowed heartbeats to stitch the world back together, just for a little while. [353]

Below, the children’s voices rose in a final, discordant verse, their game ending as the first bell rang, its echo rolling over the stones like a sigh. [375]

Liora picked up another mirror from the parapet’s edge—this one cracked, its silvering peeling like old skin. [389]

She pressed her palm to its surface and felt, rather than saw, the heartbeat she’d been given begin to unravel, its borrowed time seeping back into the air like mist. [413]

The woman would have her vision. [417]

The soldier would forget his dream. [420]

And Liora? [422]

She would walk down the terrace steps as the bells swallowed the last of the light, her pockets empty, her hands steady, her lullabies still humming just beneath the sound of her footsteps. [448]

The city needed its mirages. [451]

She needed the hush before the next ringing. [455]

In that dusky harmony, between what was and what could be, she was neither thief nor saint—just a painter of the almost-real, trading in heartbeats and echoes, always careful never to look too long at her own reflection. [492]

The last bell tolled. [495]

The rainbows faded. [497]

And the terrace, for one perfect breath, held nothing but the scent of spring and the ghost of a song no one would remember by morning. [520]

Liora smiled. [522]

Then she vanished, like she always did. [526]
