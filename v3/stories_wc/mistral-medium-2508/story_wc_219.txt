The rain had stopped just before dawn, leaving the tower’s stone skin slick with memory. [12]

Dr. Elara Vey stood at the base, her fingers tracing the grooves of the fly trapped in amber—her only inheritance from a father who’d called science a "crutch for the faithless." [30]

She’d spent a decade dissecting alien microbiomes, but the first extraterrestrial signal hadn’t been code—it was a *path*, winding through the ruins of an old observatory, its sculptures half-swallowed by ivy. [55]

The academics called it coincidence. [58]

Elara called it an invitation. [61]

She wasn’t supposed to be here. [64]

The University had revoked her funding after she published *Against the Sacred Equation*, arguing that the "pilgrimage hypothesis" was pseudoscience—that the so-called "homecoming" signals were just cosmic static, not a map to something older than Earth. [90]

But the amber fly pulsed faintly in her palm, as if answering. [98]

She followed the dusty footprints first, pressing her boot into the damp impressions left by someone—or *something*—that walked like a human but left no weight behind. [118]

The sculptures were wrong. [121]

Not in craftsmanship, but in *order*: a child’s handprint beside a star chart of a system light-years dead, a face with too many eyes weeping into a basin of rainwater that never overflowed. [143]

At the tower’s heart, the path converged on a door sealed with bronze filigree, its surface etched with the same spiral pattern as the signal. [160]

Her breath fogged the metal. [163]

Inside, the air smelled of ozone and old paper. [168]

A terminal hummed to life as she entered, its screen flickering with a single question in a dozen languages: *"What do you miss?"* [185]

Elara’s throat tightened. [188]

Not the equations. [190]

Not the lab. [192]

The amber fly warmed against her skin, and she whispered, "The way my father’s hands shook when he held a microscope." [205]

The terminal chimed. [207]

A hologram unfurled—a spiral galaxy, but not as seen from telescopes. [213]

This was the view from *inside* it, the stars not points of light but *homes*, each pulsing with a frequency that resonated in her ribs. [227]

The signal wasn’t a call. [230]

It was a *key*. [232]

The tower wasn’t built to send messages. [236]

It was built to *receive* pilgrims. [239]

Elara’s skepticism had always been a shield, but now it cracked: what if the universe wasn’t indifferent? [250]

What if it was *homesick*? [253]

The footprints behind her shifted. [256]

She turned. [258]

A figure stood in the doorway, its silhouette human but its edges blurring like heat haze. [268]

"It’s your turn to leave the prints now," it said, voice like rain on bronze. [279]

She stepped forward. [282]

The amber fly dissolved into her palm, its light seeping into her veins. [291]

The terminal’s question changed: *"Where do you belong?"* [297]

Elara didn’t answer. [300]

She reached out and touched the galaxy instead. [305]

The tower trembled. [307]

Outside, the sculptures rearranged themselves, their new order forming a path that led *up*—not into the sky, but into the fabric of the spiral itself. [328]

Her father had been wrong. [331]

Science wasn’t the absence of faith. [335]

It was the *language* of it. [338]

The figure extended a hand. [341]

"Most never come back," it murmured. [345]

Elara smiled. [347]

"That’s not a warning," she said. [351]

"It’s a promise." [353]

She took its hand. [355]

The last thing she saw was the tower, rainwashed and empty, its door now bearing two sets of footprints—hers, and the ones that had waited centuries to be followed. [376]

Somewhere, a star called her name. [380]

She went. [382]

The amber fly, remade, glowed in the dark where the path began anew. [391]

Back at the University, her empty lab gathered dust. [396]

On the blackboard, a single equation remained, half-erased: *E=mc²… + (memory)*. [410]

The dean sighed and wiped it clean. [414]

Outside, spring rain fell on pavement where no footprints appeared. [422]

But the tower knew. [425]

And the stars. [427]

Always, the stars. [429]

They remembered the shape of her hands. [433]
