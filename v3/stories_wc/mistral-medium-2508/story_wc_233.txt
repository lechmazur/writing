The queen had long since stopped believing in omens, but the dreams would not let her rest. [16]
Each night, the same vision: a pulse of crimson light seeping from the ridge, staining the sky like a wound. [31]
Her advisors called it fatigue, the weight of a throne too heavy for mortal hands—but she knew better. [46]
There was something in the ember grotto, something that bled starlight, and it had begun to call her by name. [62]

The climb was forbidden, the ridge a jagged spine above the clouds where the air grew thin and the wind hummed like a blade. [81]
She went alone, her slippers silent on the cobalt stone, her breath measured, her will softly commanding the mist to part. [99]
The last warning had come at dawn—a scroll sealed in black wax, the high priest’s script trembling with urgency: *"The grotto hungers."* [118]
She had burned it without reply. [122]

Halfway up, the first fireflies of summer flickered to life, their glow syncing with her exhale like a shared secret. [138]
They clustered around her fingers, tiny lanterns guiding her forward, their light not gold but the faintest violet—wrong, like everything else here. [155]
The grotto’s mouth yawned before her, a cavern of smoldering veins where the rock itself seemed to breathe. [169]
Inside, the air tasted of copper and old magic, the kind that curled in the back of the throat and refused to be swallowed. [184]

She knelt beside the fissure where the starlight bled, thick and slow as honey. [194]
It pooled in her palm, warm and alive, and when she pressed her fingers to her temples, the dreams unspooled—not as visions, but as memories. [211]
*Hers.* [212]
A child’s voice, her own, whispering to the dark: *"Take me with you."* [221]
A bargain struck in bloodless innocence, a promise the grotto had waited decades to collect. [232]

The fireflies surged, their violet glow sharpening into teeth. [239]
The queen laughed, low and bitter, because of course it was always a trade—kingships for wishes, crowns for curses, and now her soul for a truth she’d buried too deep. [259]
The starlight pulsed brighter, painting her shadow on the wall in shades of crimson, stretching it tall and hungry. [275]
She could run. [277]
She could scream. [279]
But the grotto had been patient, and so had she. [284]

With a breath like a sigh, she dipped her hand into the fissure and let the light take her. [296]
The pain was exquisite, a thousand needles stitching her skin to the sky. [305]
Her bones hummed with the weight of the stars, her veins filling with their fire, and when she opened her eyes, she was no longer a queen but a constellation given flesh. [328]
The fireflies spiraled around her, their wings now edged in silver, their song the same lullaby her nurse had sung to ward off nightmares. [348]

Below, the kingdom would wake to find their monarch gone, her throne draped in cobwebs, her crown melted into a puddle of starlight. [367]
They would call it abandonment. [370]
They would call it madness. [373]
But high above the clouds, the queen—no, the *thing* that had been a queen—stretched her luminous arms and smiled. [390]
The grotto had not lied. [393]
It had not taken. [395]
It had *remembered*. [397]

And memory, she thought as the first true star of evening pierced her chest like a needle, was the kindest kind of bleeding. [415]
The wind carried her voice down the ridge, a softly commanding whisper: *"Now you see."* [425]
The fireflies scattered, bearing her words to the valleys below, where the priests would clutch their holy texts and weep. [441]
The final warning had never been for her. [446]
It had been for them. [449]

When the next queen climbed the ridge—because there would always be another queen, another hungry heart—the ember grotto would be waiting. [469]
And it would bleed. [471] </story>
