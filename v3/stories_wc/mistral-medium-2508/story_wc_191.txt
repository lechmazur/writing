The last lore keeper of Veythar knelt in the damp earth, her gloves slick with the dew of forgotten fruit. [19]
Beneath the boughs of the hidden orchard—where silver-leaved trees bore glowing pomegranates—she traced the edge of a ruby flake embedded in the bark, its crimson pulse faint as a dying star. [45]
The flake was no accident; it was a key, left by the architects of the unclaimed throne, a relic of the old ascension rites before the city had turned its back on the sky. [70]
Her name was Elsin, and she was the only one who remembered the rites—or so she believed. [84]
Wisely adventurous, she had spent decades piecing together fragments of the past, but tonight, with the twin moons bleeding into dawn, she had until sunrise to act. [108]

The waterfall at the orchard’s heart was no ordinary cascade—it fractured light into a kaleidoscope of shifting hues, a living veil hiding what lay beyond. [129]
Elsin adjusted the lenses over her eyes, their brass frames etched with equations for bending perception, and stepped through the curtain of water. [148]
The air hummed with the resonance of old machinery, half-buried in the loam. [157]
She pressed her palm to the trunk of the central tree, its bark peeling away in delicate layers, each revealing murals of the first ascenders—figures climbing a spiral stair that vanished into the clouds. [185]
The paint was alive, shifting under her touch, the pigments rearranging to show her the path: *sally forth, but not upward*. [201]

Her breath hitched. [203]
The stairway of ascension wasn’t above—it was *below*. [208]
The ruby flake in her pocket throbbed as she dug her fingers into the soil, uncovering a hatch sealed with the same crimson mineral. [225]
The lock recognized the flake’s resonance, clicking open with a sigh of released pressure. [236]
A ladder descended into darkness, its rungs inscribed with warnings in a language only lore keepers could read: *"The throne is not for the seated, but for the rising."* [257]

Elsin descended, the air growing warmer, thick with the scent of ozone and old metal. [267]
The walls of the shaft were lined with more murals, these depicting the fall of the last ascender—a figure torn between grasping the throne and letting it go. [286]
She understood now: the unclaimed throne wasn’t abandoned. [292]
It was *waiting*. [294]
Not for a ruler, but for someone to *unmake* it, to break the cycle of power that had choked the city for centuries. [310]

At the bottom, the chamber opened into a vast atrium, its ceiling a domed mirror reflecting the approaching sunrise. [323]
The throne sat at its center, woven from the same ruby-flaked metal as the flake, its arms outstretched like a lover’s invitation. [342]
Elsin approached, her boots clicking against the floor’s geometric tiles, each step echoing the heartbeat of the city above. [358]
She placed the flake into the throne’s hollowed palm. [364]
The metal groaned, then *melted*, the ruby dissolving into liquid light that surged upward, shattering the mirror-ceiling in a cascade of golden shards. [382]

The stairway of ascension unfurled—not as stone, but as a helix of pure energy, spiraling into the breaking dawn. [397]
Elsin didn’t climb. [399]
She turned and walked back toward the orchard, the weight of the unclaimed throne lifting from the world like a held breath finally released. [417]
Behind her, the chamber collapsed inward, the murals rewriting themselves into a new story: *"Here, the last lore keeper chose the ground over the sky."* [438]

By the time she emerged, the waterfall was just water again, the kaleidoscope faded to clear light. [450]
The orchard’s fruit had ripened overnight, their glow dimming to ordinary red. [460]
Elsin plucked one, bit into its sweet flesh, and smiled. [467]
The city would wake soon, unaware that its chains had rusted to dust. [477]
She had until sunrise to vanish into the myths she’d spent her life preserving—now remade. [492]

As the first true light touched the trees, she whispered the old words to the wind: *"Some thrones are meant to stay empty."* [508]
Then she walked away, the path ahead unmarked, the past finally at peace. [520]
The ruby flake, now just a memory, gleamed one last time in the corner of her eye before fading entirely. [536]
The age of ascension was over. [540]
The age of choosing had begun. [543]
