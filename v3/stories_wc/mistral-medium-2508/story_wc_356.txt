The treetop village of Veyth hung suspended between earth and sky, its bridges swaying like vines in the tide’s slow breath—when the sea below stilled, the air thickened with the scent of damp bark and distant salt. [38]

Liora, the village’s most ambitious herbalist, knelt on her balcony, fingers tracing the veins of a single corpse flower seed, its husk pulsing faintly with the rhythm of the turning tide’s thought. [68]

She had stolen it from the Elders’ vault, where such seeds were kept locked away, whispered to bloom only under the gaze of the moon’s third face—a wisdom too sharp for reckless hands. [98]

But Liora’s hands were never reckless; they were precise, olfactorily sensitive to the point of obsession, able to parse the grief in wilting lavender or the deceit in overripe figs. [125]

She pressed the seed to her palm, inhaling its musk—rotting honey, buried secrets—and knew this was the key to the serenity she craved, the stillness inside the sway. [148]

Her grandmother’s voice, thin as parchment, drifted from memory: *"Write what the hands forget."* [158]

Liora reached for her journal, its pages wrapped in brown paper, the interiors scribbled with generations of doodles—her family’s custom, a language of loops and leaves that told stories words couldn’t. [185]

She sketched the seed’s spiral, the way its scent coiled like smoke, then paused as the village’s central bell tolled, its brass hum vibrating through the walkways. [207]

The Elders were gathering. [210]

They would know by dawn what she’d taken; the corpse flower’s perfume was impossible to hide, its wisdom an undercurrent that dragged truths to the surface like flotsam. [230]

Liora’s motivation wasn’t defiance, but hunger—a need to cultivate serenity within motion, to prove that even in Veyth’s endless sway, roots could be steady. [252]

She planted the seed in a pot of crushed moonstone and whispered the old words, her breath misting the leaves of her journal. [267]

Outside, the tide turned. [270]

The first tendril broke soil at midnight, black as a bruise, unfurling with a sigh that smelled of wet earth and old bones. [285]

Liora didn’t sleep. [288]

By morning, the flower stood taller than her, its petals streaked with veins of silver, its scent a living thing—sweet and suffocating, like the hush before a storm. [308]

The Elders arrived as the bloom yawned open, their robes whispering against the wood. [320]

"You sought wisdom," the eldest said, her voice the rustle of drying reeds. [328]

Liora didn’t deny it. [331]

The flower’s perfume wrapped around them, thick with visions: a child’s laughter in the branches, a lover’s argument on the tide’s edge, the village’s unspoken fears curling like smoke. [355]

The Elders recoiled, but Liora stepped closer, her journal clutched to her chest. [365]

She had doodled the truth in the margins all along—the way her mother’s hands trembled when she braided hair, the exact shade of green that meant *forgive me* in their silent language. [390]

The corpse flower wasn’t wisdom. [394]

It was a mirror. [396]

And in its reflection, Liora saw the serenity she’d chased wasn’t in stillness, but in the sway itself—the wildflower hush of a village breathing, of roots tangling in the dark, of hands that knew when to hold and when to let go. [430]

She plucked a petal and pressed it into her journal, the ink bleeding into violet. [440]

The Elders watched, their disapproval softening like wax in heat. [448]

That evening, as the tide’s thought turned again, Liora hung a new bridge—this one strung with corpse flower vines, their scent a quiet invitation to those who dared to listen. [472]

The village didn’t speak of the theft. [477]

But when the next seed was taken, they left the vault unlocked. [484]

Liora smiled into her tea, its steam curling like the first doodle she’d ever traced—her grandmother’s hand, steadying hers. [503]

The undercurrent of wisdom, she wrote, *is just another name for trust.* [512]

And for the first time, the sway of the trees felt like an embrace. [520] </story>
