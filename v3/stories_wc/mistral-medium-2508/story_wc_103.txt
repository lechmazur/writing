The living bridge garden stretched beneath a sky the color of old silver, its arches woven from vines that pulsed like veins, their leaves whispering secrets older than the hedges they cradled. [31]

Liora, the maze designer, traced her fingers along the thorns of a blackthorn hedge, its branches twisting in fractal patterns only she could decipher—each curve a question, each knot an answer half-remembered. [58]

She had come here not to build, but to unbuild, to peel back the layers of the garden’s oldest maze, the one that wasn’t meant to be solved but *endured*. [80]

In her satchel, the halo fragment hummed against her ribs, a sliver of something that had once encircled a saint’s brow, now warped by centuries of being passed through hands that didn’t understand its hunger. [108]

The photographs were the first to fade. [113]

They’d begun as crisp edges and deep shadows—her mother’s smile, the scar on her father’s palm, the way the light slanted through the greenhouse on the day she first realized time wasn’t a line but a *texture*. [139]

Now, the images bled into the paper, faces dissolving like sugar in rain, as if the past itself was being erased by the act of looking. [157]

Liora knelt at the maze’s heart, where the hyperbolic geometry of the paths bent space into impossible loops, and pressed the halo fragment into the soil. [175]

The garden *shuddered*. [177]

The vines of the living bridge recoiled, then surged forward, weaving themselves into a spiral staircase that wasn’t there a breath before, its steps leading not up but *through*—into the quaking reverie of a moment already lived. [203]

She climbed. [205]

The air thickened with the scent of ozone and crushed lavender, the same smell that had clung to her grandmother’s shawl the day she warned Liora about "the weight of looking back." [226]

At the top, the maze wasn’t a maze anymore. [232]

It was a corridor of fading photographs, their edges curling into embers, each one a door to a memory that wasn’t hers—but the halo fragment *pulled* her toward them, its hum now a chant: *Find the texture. [255]

Find the seam.* [257]

She reached for a photograph of a woman in a garden identical to this one, her fingers brushing the paper just as it disintegrated into motes of gold. [274]

The disintegration wasn’t destruction. [277]

It was *unfolding*. [279]

The woman’s laughter spilled into the air, rich and warm, and Liora realized with a gasp that she was standing in the photograph now, the garden alive around her in a version of itself that had existed seventy years prior. [303]

The halo fragment burned against her palm. [308]

"You’re trapped," the woman said, not unkindly, her voice layered with echoes of every other voice that had ever spoken here. [321]

"Not in space," Liora whispered. [324]

"In *when*." [326]

The woman smiled, her form already beginning to fray at the edges, retrocognitively trapped like all the others who had sought the maze’s center. [342]

"They all think they’re the first to find it," the woman murmured, her fingers passing through Liora’s shoulder like mist. [356]

"But the garden doesn’t remember names. [360]

Only *textures*." [362]

Liora clenched the halo fragment until her bones ached. [367]

If time was a fabric, then the photographs were the threads, and the maze was the needle—stitching her into a pattern she hadn’t chosen. [384]

She turned and ran, not back the way she’d come, but *sideways*, along the hyperbolic curve where the garden’s geometry bent time like a reed in the wind. [405]

The photographs screamed as she passed, their voices rising into a chorus of half-forgotten moments, but she didn’t stop. [419]

At the edge of the living bridge, where the vines knotted into a final, trembling arch, she hurled the halo fragment into the abyss below. [434]

It didn’t fall. [436]

It *unraveled*, the fragment peeling into a thousand glowing filaments that rewove the air itself, the garden groaning as the photographs flickered back into focus, their colors deepening, their edges sharp once more. [460]

Liora collapsed onto the bridge, her breath ragged, her hands shaking. [468]

The maze was just a maze again. [472]

The past was just the past. [475]

But as she pressed her palm to the wood, she felt it—the *grain* of time, rough and uneven beneath her skin, and she laughed, because she finally understood: [495]

The texture wasn’t something to discover. [499]

It was something to *survive*. [501]

The garden sighed around her, the living bridge swaying gently, as if it, too, had been holding its breath. [515]

Liora stood, brushing the last of the disintegrated photograph dust from her sleeves, and stepped forward—not into the maze, but *beside* it, where the hyperbolic paths didn’t twist but *stretched*, thin and trembling, into the future. [540]

She would build a new one. [544]

This time, she wouldn’t solve for the center. [548]

She would design the *edges*. [551]

And maybe, just maybe, the texture would hold. [558]
