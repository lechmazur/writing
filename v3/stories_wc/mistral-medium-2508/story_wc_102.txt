The viaduct stretched like a spine of crumbling stone, its arches wreathed in twilight’s violet haze, where the last petals of the night-blooming jasmine clung to the damp air. [30]
Elias adjusted the brass lens of his camera obscura, the device warm against his palm, its mirror catching the faintest glow of the setting sun—a light that seemed to whisper rather than shine. [58]
He had spent years chasing images that flickered at the edges of sight, not for their beauty, but because they carried the weight of something half-remembered, a past life that surfaced in fragments: the press of a hand against his chest, a voice murmuring *here is where the unused love goes*. [103]
Tonight, the viaduct’s fog curled around his ankles as he exhaled, watching his breath form shapes—first a serpent, then a key—before dissolving into the damp. [129]
The air here was thick with the scent of wet earth and something older, like iron left too long in rain, and Elias knew this was the place the memory had been leading him to. [157]

Beneath the central arch, half-buried in the moss, lay a shard of pale green jade: Kwan Yin’s Tear, they called it in the village below, though no one dared touch it. [180]
The legend said it held the sorrow of a thousand unspoken kindnesses, that it could heal what was broken by revealing the truth of a breath—how it hitched when lies were told, how it steadied when the heart finally admitted what it wanted. [220]
Elias knelt, his fingers trembling not from cold but from the certainty that this was the spark he’d been pilgrimaging toward, the thing that would show him where the love he’d failed to give—or receive—had been stored all this time. [259]
He pressed the jade to his sternum and inhaled, slow and deliberate, as the camera obscura’s lens caught the shift in his shadow: it stretched, then split, revealing a second silhouette beside his own—a woman with hands outstretched, her form woven from the same twilight as the viaduct’s bloom. [307]

*"You kept me in your ribs,"* she said, her voice the sound of petals unfurling. [316]
Elias exhaled, and the breath between them shimmered, a thread of silver connecting their chests. [325]
The memory surfaced whole now: he had been a physician in a time of plague, and she his patient, dying not of sickness but of loneliness, her last words lost to the mask he wore. [349]
He had sworn to find where such love went when it had no place to land, and the jade’s weight against his skin burned as it answered: *It stays. It waits.* [367]
The viaduct’s stones hummed, the fog parting just enough to show the river below, its surface scattered with floating embers—each one a spark of unused love, drifting until someone dared to breathe it in. [397]

Elias understood then that healing wasn’t mending what was broken, but revealing what had always been there. [410]
He turned the camera obscura toward the sky, letting the last light project her image onto the inside of his eyelids, and when he breathed out this time, the thread between them didn’t dissolve—it wove into the air, a bridge of lucid fog, and the jade in his hand grew warm, then weightless, then gone. [450]
The viaduct bloomed anew, its arches alive with the glow of a thousand reclaimed sparks, and Elias laughed, his shadow no longer split but whole, cradling the shape of her hands against his heart. [480]
Below, the river’s embers rose like fireflies, drawn to the breath of the living, and he knew: the pilgrimage had never been about finding. [498]
It had been about remembering how to carry. [502]

The twilight deepened, but the viaduct no longer felt like a place between worlds—it was a threshold, and he was the keeper now, his camera obscura trained on the horizon where the next lost spark would appear. [530]
He adjusted the lens one last time, catching the flicker of a child’s shadow on the distant bridge, their breath hitching with the weight of a question they hadn’t yet learned to ask. [555]
Elias smiled. [557]
The jasmine’s scent thickened, the fog curling around his wrists like an invitation, and as he inhaled, the viaduct’s stones sang back: *Here. Here is where the unused love goes.* [580]
*Until it is ready to be found.* [583] </story>
