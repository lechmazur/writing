The seed sorter, Liora, perched on a swaying branch of the ashen arbor, her fingers deft as she separated the plump wheat seeds from the chaff. [22]

The arbor wasn’t like other trees—it floated, its gnarled roots dangling into the mist below, anchored to nothing but the will of the wind. [41]

Above her, the sky was the color of old parchment, streaked with the last embers of a sun that had burned itself out centuries ago. [60]

This was the hush, the breath between what had been and what would be, when the leaves whispered secrets if you knew how to listen. [80]

Liora’s task was sacred: she sorted seeds not just by size or shape, but by the stories they carried, the futures they promised. [98]

Today, though, her fingers stilled. [101]

A single speck of dust—no, not dust—had settled on her palm: a fragment of moonstone cabochon, iridescent as a dragonfly’s wing. [116]

She prodded it with a fingernail, and the speck *shuddered*, unfolding into a delicate, spiraling filament. [128]

Regional folklore spoke of such things—fragments of the First Song, lost when the sky cracked open and the old gods forgot their names. [146]

The filament pulsed, warm as breath, and Liora understood: it was a key. [156]

Not for locks, but for the language of the arbor’s leaves, which had been falling in patterns too precise to be random. [173]

She tucked the speck into the hollow of her cheek (where her grandmother had once hidden lucky stones) and climbed higher, toward the arbor’s crown. [192]

There, the branches cradled tiny monuments—stacked pebbles for the drowned river nymphs, a thimble of salt for the merchant who’d bartered his shadow, a lock of hair bound with twine for the child who’d turned into a wind. [222]

Liora built her own: a tower of seeds, each one chosen for the way it *sang* when rolled between her fingers. [238]

At its peak, she placed the moonstone speck. [243]

The arbor groaned, its bark splitting along veins of silver light. [249]

The leaves began to fall in earnest now, not drifting but *spelling*, landing in runes that glowed faintly against the ashen wood. [264]

Liora read them with her fingertips, the way blind scholars read braille: *"The hush is a door. [275] The transformed remember. [278] You are the key’s keeper now."* [282]

A gust howled through the branches, and the monuments trembled. [288]

The pebble stack *melted* into a puddle of river water. [294]

The thimble of salt *rose* as a specter in merchant’s robes, its hollow eyes fixed on her. [306]

The lock of hair *unraveled*, weaving into the shape of a laughing child who dissolved into the wind. [319]

Liora didn’t flinch. [321]

She prod the moonstone again, and this time, the arbor *answered*. [330]

Its roots coiled upward, forming a ladder into the smoky heavens, where the past and prophecy tangled like vines. [345]

The leaves’ message was clear: the transformed always emerged changed, but the change was never an end—only a new kind of sorting. [363]

Liora pocketed a handful of seeds (the ones that hummed loudest) and stepped onto the first rung. [375]

Below, the arbor’s monuments crumbled into dust, their stories absorbed back into the wood. [387]

Above, the sky parted like a curtain, revealing a landscape of floating islands, each one a fragment of a world that had been or would be. [406]

She climbed, the moonstone speck now a star embedded in her palm, pulsing in time with her heartbeat. [421]

The hush wasn’t a pause after all. [425]

It was an inhale. [427]

And Liora, the orderly seed sorter, was the breath that would carry the arbor’s secrets into the next telling. [443]

When she reached the top, she found not an end, but a ledge—and on it, a single sapling, its leaves already whispering. [460]

She knelt, pressed her glowing palm to its bark, and listened. [467]

The first word it spoke was her name. [471]

The second was *"begin."* [473]

Liora smiled. [475]

She had always known the work of sorting was never truly about order. [483]

It was about recognizing which stories were ready to take root. [490]

She plucked a leaf from the sapling and ate it. [495]

When she stood, her skin was dappled with bark, her fingers tipped with thorns. [506]

The arbor below swayed, its branches stretching toward her like welcoming arms. [517]

She jumped. [519]

The wind caught her, and for a moment, she was neither seed nor sorter, but something in between. [533]

When she landed, the arbor was gone. [538]

In its place stood a grove of saplings, each one humming a different tune. [547]

Liora rolled up her sleeves (now woven from vine and shadow) and got to work. [558]

The hush had passed. [561]

Prophecy was a seed, and she would sort it carefully. [567]

One by one, the leaves began to fall. [571]

This time, she understood every word. [575] </story>
