The silo had been a grain bin once, its curved walls humming with the weight of harvests long rotted away. [17]
Now it held books—shelves spiraling upward like the grooves of a colossal phonograph, each volume a whisper pressed between covers. [35]
Elias Vey kept his fingers light on the ladder rungs, climbing toward the third-tier alcove where the air smelled of damp parchment and old smoke. [54]
He was the last historian, though no one remained to care. [62]

The fragment of tapestry had arrived that morning, wrapped in oilcloth and tied with frayed twine, left on the reading desk like an offering. [80]
Dragons coiled across the threadbare wool, their jaws unspooling fire in faded crimson, the edges charred as if salvaged from a pyre. [98]
Elias didn’t question its origin; things still drifted in through the silo’s cracked seal—a boot, a child’s doll, once a human ribbone bleached clean by time. [118]
He unfolded the tapestry with the care of a man handling a wound, his sensitively perceptive fingers tracing the stitches where the weaver had hesitated. [135]
The dragons weren’t just decoration. [139]
Their bodies formed an axis, a pivot point where the world had once turned before something—some *displacement*—had knocked it loose. [154]

He knew because he’d been probing the same fracture for years. [161]
The fireplace in the silo’s core was cold now, but the diaries he pulled from its ashes still radiated a ghost of heat, their pages half-burned, half-legible. [180]
*"The sky split like a seam,"* one read, the ink blistered. [187]
*"The dragons didn’t fly away. They* pulled." [193]
Elias exhaled through his nose, the sound like a rusted hinge. [199]
The last human dream had been dreamt decades ago, but the walls remembered. [209]
They remembered the way the air had *shuddered*, the way the tapestry’s axis had been wrenched sideways, leaving the world unmoored in its wake. [227]

He pressed the fragment to his cheek. [231]
The wool was coarse, but beneath it, the threads thrummed—a resonance just below hearing, like the harmonic of a plucked wire. [245]
The silo’s metal skin groaned in the wind outside, a sound that might have been a sigh or a warning. [257]
Elias wasn’t collecting history. [261]
He was collecting the stories the walls had heard, the ones that had seeped into the mortar and the rust, the ones that would outlast the dreamers. [277]
The tapestry was a key, or a map, or a confession. [285]
It didn’t matter which. [287]

He fed another diary into the fireplace’s maw, not to burn it, but to coax the embers back to life. [301]
The half-burned pages curled like dying insects, then glowed anew, their charred edges spilling light onto the tapestry’s dragons. [318]
For a breath, the axis in the weaving *moved*. [323]
The silo tilted—no, the *world* tilted—and Elias felt the displacement like a hook behind his ribs, tugging. [336]
He didn’t resist. [338]
The last historian had no need for balance. [342]

When the sensation passed, the tapestry was warm in his hands, the dragons’ fire no longer faded. [354]
The diaries in the fireplace had turned to ash, but the words lingered in the air, a bronze quiet hum: *"We named it the Sundering, but it was really a trade."* [372]
*"They took the dreams. We took the sky."* [377]
Elias folded the tapestry carefully, then slipped it into the pocket over his heart. [387]
The silo’s ladder creaked as he descended, each step a metronome counting down to something he couldn’t name. [403]
Outside, the wind carried the scent of rain, though no clouds remained to make it. [415]
He didn’t look back. [418]

The next offering would come soon. [422]
A shoe, a letter, a bone. [425]
He would listen. [427]
He would probe. [429]
The walls were patient, and so was he. [433]
The last human dream had been dreamt, but the stories were still breathing, still twisting around the displaced axis like vines around a broken trellis. [452]
Elias Vey would be there to catch them when they fell. [460]

He stepped into the wind, and the silo sighed behind him, its metal skin singing a note just shy of sorrow. [475]
The tapestry in his pocket pulsed once, warm as a living thing. [483]
Somewhere, a dragon turned in its sleep. [488]
Somewhere, the world remembered how to turn. [494]

Elias walked until the silo was a smudge on the horizon, then kept walking. [505]
The stories would find him. [508]
They always did. [510]

The wind carried the scent of old paper and older fire, and for the first time in years, Elias smiled. [524]
It was a small thing, cracked at the edges, but it fit the shape of the moment: fragile, inevitable, and bronze-quiet as the hum of a spinning world. [544]
He reached into his pocket and let his fingers rest against the tapestry’s hidden heat. [554]
The dragons were waiting. [557]
So was he. [559] </story>
