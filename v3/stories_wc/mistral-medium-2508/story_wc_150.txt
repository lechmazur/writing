The first time Elias touched the sundial base, its stone was warm as if still catching the sun, though it had been buried for decades. [21]

He had returned to the valley after twenty years abroad, his hands calloused from foreign labor but his heart still light with the old stories—how the orchard above the catacombs once bore fruit that tasted of memory, how the roots of its trees cradled the bones of saints. [58]

The villagers called him *the returnee*, their voices thick with cautious hope, as if his presence might undo the blight that had withered the orchard since the war. [83]

Elias didn’t believe in miracles, but he believed in roots. [91]

He began in the tomb of Saint Maris, where the air smelled of damp earth and something sweeter, like overripe figs left too long in the sun. [108]

The catacomb walls were lined with niches, each holding a skull or a bundle of bones wrapped in frayed cloth, the skeletal fingers tangled with tree roots that pulsed faintly, as if breathing. [135]

His lantern cast long shadows as he brushed dirt from the sundial base—a circular slab etched with spirals, its center hollowed like a wound. [153]

“They say the saints used it to measure prayers,” old Liora had told him, her milky eyes reflecting the firelight. [167]

Elias traced the grooves with his fingertips, wondering if faith could be dug up like relics, or if it had to be rebuilt from the broken pieces. [183]

He worked methodically, following the roots as they snaked between ribs and pelvises, his progress slow but purposeful. [197]

Each bone he uncovered seemed to hum, not with ghosts, but with a quiet insistence, as if the dead were not gone but waiting, their journeys interrupted by violence, their stories suspended mid-sentence. [228]

By the third day, he found the first seed—a smooth, dark pit nestled in the palm of a skeletal hand, still plump with dormant life. [245]

He planted it in the hollow of the sundial base, pressing soil around it with his thumbs, whispering the old blessing his grandmother had taught him: *“Grow where you are needed.”* [267]

The villagers began to leave offerings at the tomb’s entrance—jars of honey, copper coins, scraps of embroidered cloth—though none dared descend into the dark with him. [289]

Elias didn’t mind the solitude. [293]

He wandered the catacombs by lantern-light, his path dictated by the roots, which seemed to guide him toward pockets of warmth, places where the air tasted sweeter, as if the trees above were exhaling. [320]

One evening, he uncovered a mural half-buried in the wall: a procession of figures with outstretched hands, their faces blurred by time, walking toward a door of light. [341]

His breath caught. [344]

The painting was old, older than the war, older than the orchard’s blight, and yet the figures’ postures were warmly curious, as if they had turned mid-step to invite him along. [370]

Elias pressed his palm to the wall and felt a vibration, faint but unmistakable—the same pulse he’d felt in the roots, in the sundial’s stone. [388]

That night, he dreamed of the procession. [393]

In the dream, the figures carried lanterns like his own, their flames flickering in unison, and when he reached for the nearest hand, it was solid, warm. [413]

He woke to the sound of dripping water and the scent of green things pushing through soil. [423]

The sundial base had cracked. [427]

A sapling—no thicker than his wrist—had split the stone, its leaves unfurling like hands in prayer, their edges gilded by the first light of dawn filtering down from the orchard above. [453]

Elias laughed, the sound raw and disbelieving, as the roots around him trembled in response, as if the catacombs themselves had been holding their breath. [475]

The villagers would call it a miracle. [480]

He would call it a beginning. [483]

For the first time in years, the air smelled of ripe fruit, of earth turning itself over, of journeys resumed. [499]

Elias picked up his lantern, its flame steady now, and followed the roots deeper into the dark. [512]

Some things, he decided, were not meant to stay buried. [519]

And some faiths were not lost, only waiting to be rebuilt, one purposeful step at a time. [532]

Above him, the orchard stirred, its branches heavy with the weight of what was to come. [544]
