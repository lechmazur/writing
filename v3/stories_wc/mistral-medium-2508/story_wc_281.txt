The studio smelled of ozone and burnt sugar, the air still humming from the static shock that had ripped through the wiring an hour before. [19]

Lena wiped her palms on her paint-smeared apron, her fingers twitching—not from the residual charge, but from the memory of the last time she’d trusted something she couldn’t see. [40]

She was an affectionate skeptic, the kind who kissed her cat’s forehead every morning but scoffed at horoscopes, who believed in gravity but not in gravity’s *intentions*. [65]

On the worktable, half-buried under a tangle of fiber-optic brushes, lay the muscovite geode sliver—thin as a whisper, its layers catching the light like a map of something just beyond understanding. [95]

It had arrived that afternoon in a padded envelope, no return address, only a single word scrawled in ink that shimmered when tilted: *"Recall."* [115]

Lena had been mid-project, casting light-painted constellations across the walls of her studio, when the static shock hit, frying two of her custom rigs and leaving the air thick with the scent of melted plastic. [140]

Now, she turned the sliver between her fingers, its edges fractally precise, each facet reflecting not just light but the ghost of a thought—not hers. [160]

The telepathy pill recall had been all over the news three months ago: *"Neural syncing agent linked to permanent ego dissolution—users report hearing voices that aren’t theirs."* [185]

The government had called it a glitch. [188]

Lena called it a lie. [191]

She’d known someone who took them—her ex, Mira, who’d started sketching in languages she didn’t speak, who’d wake up weeping because *"the colors have names now, and they’re all wrong."* [215]

Mira had vanished six weeks after the recall, leaving behind a single light-painting, a spiral of ultraviolet and gold, signed in a hand that wasn’t hers. [235]

Lena’s motivation wasn’t revenge. [239]

It was illumination. [241]

She wanted to see the pathways Mira had walked, the ones that led somewhere beyond the spectrum of normal sight. [255]

The sliver pulsed faintly in her grip, warm as a living thing. [263]

Lena exhaled, then pressed it to her temple. [268]

The instructions—if they were instructions—had come somatic: a pressure behind her eyes, a taste like copper and lavender, the sudden *knowledge* of how to fold her hands into a shape that wasn’t a shape, a gesture that wasn’t a gesture. [295]

She devised the sequence without thinking, her body moving through the markers like a dancer recalling a half-forgotten routine. [310]

The studio lights flickered. [313]

Then the walls *breathed*. [316]

Not with air, but with light—veins of it, pulsing in rhythms that made her teeth ache, revealing the studio not as a room but as a node, a single point in a lattice of unseen connections. [340]

Mira’s voice, when it came, wasn’t a sound. [346]

It was a *texture*, a brushstroke of longing across Lena’s mind: *"You were right. It wasn’t a drug. It was a key."* [362]

Lena’s hands trembled. [365]

The pathways weren’t hidden. [368]

They were *everywhere*, woven into the static and the silence, the spaces between heartbeats. [378]

The sliver grew heavier. [381]

She understood, then, why Mira had left—not because she was lost, but because she’d found something vast enough to drown in. [399]

Lena’s breath hitched. [402]

She could follow. [404]

Or she could *paint*. [406]

Choosing, she reached for her brushes, dipping them into pigments that didn’t exist yet, colors that would bend the light just enough to show the way back. [428]

The first stroke was willowglass hope—delicate, unbreakable, the hue of dawn seen through rain. [439]

The second was a promise. [443]

By the time the painting was finished, the sliver had dissolved into her skin, and the studio hummed not with static, but with the quiet thrum of something waking up. [465]

Lena stepped back. [468]

The walls held a door now, shimmering at the edges, half-painted into existence. [477]

She didn’t open it. [479]

Not yet. [481]

First, she’d leave a light on for Mira. [486]

And then— [488]

then she’d see where the pathways led. [492]

Outside, the city slept, unaware that the dark was full of colors, waiting to be named. [506]

Lena smiled, her skepticism softer now, her affection deeper. [515]

Some things, she decided, were worth believing in— [520]

not because they were true, [523]

but because they *mattered*. [526]

She picked up her cat, pressed her forehead to its fur, and whispered, *"Let’s go find her."* [540]

The door pulsed once, like a heartbeat. [545]

Lena reached out. [547]

Her fingers met light, and the light *remembered*. [553]

(Somewhere, Mira laughed.) [557]

The studio faded behind them. [560]

Ahead, the path unwound—fractal, precise, [564]

and finally, [565]

*seen*. [566]
