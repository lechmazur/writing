The geese had left the sky empty, their V-formations dissolving into the horizon like a breath held too long. [20]

Liora stood in the heart of the city of forgotten fountains, where the last working pump gurgled rust instead of water, its basin choked with coins turned green by time. [43]
She was a luminous skeptic—someone who saw the glow of old lies but refused to call them truth, even when they shimmered. [60]
Her fingers traced the edges of the stained glass box in her palm, its fractured light casting jagged shadows on the cobblestones. [77]
It had been pressed into her hands by a stranger who smelled of damp wool and burnt sugar, his voice a whisper: *"Only sidereal patience can unstick what’s been sealed."* [99]

She didn’t believe in patience, celestial or otherwise. [106]
But the box hummed when she held it, a vibration like a plucked string, and inside, something pulsed—memories, the stranger had said, trapped like insects in amber. [126]
Liora’s own memories were sharp-edged things, the kind that cut when you gripped them too tight. [138]
She knew what it was to be trapped. [143]

The city’s alleys curled like old questions, their walls lined with breadcrumbs—not the kind for birds, but for those who followed patterns. [160]
Glass shards embedded in mortar, a child’s chalk arrow half-washed by rain, the faint scent of lavender where none grew. [176]
She followed them, her boots scuffing against stones worn smooth by centuries of footsteps, all leading to the same place: the Bone Fountain. [192]
Its basin was dry, its spouts clogged with the calcified remains of wishes, and at its center stood a door of tarnished brass, seamlessly fused into the stone. [212]

Liora pressed the stained glass box against the door. [218]
The humming grew louder, the fractures in the glass aligning with cracks in the brass like a puzzle solving itself. [232]
*"Liberating memories isn’t kindness,"* she muttered, but her hands didn’t waver. [242]
The door groaned, resisting, then gave way with a sigh of stale air—sidereal patience, she realized, wasn’t waiting. [256]
It was knowing *when* to push. [259]

Inside, the chamber was a vault of suspended light, threads of color weaving through the dark like spider silk. [273]
Each thread held a memory: a woman laughing with a mouth full of pomegranate seeds, a man weeping over a broken compass, a child chasing a kite that never came down. [291]
Liora reached for one, and it clung to her fingers, sticky as honey. [299]
*"They’re not yours to take,"* a voice hissed from the shadows—her own, but younger, angrier. [312]

She hesitated. [314]
The box in her hand pulsed again, warmer now, its light bleeding through her skin. [324]
Realistically imaginative—that’s what her mother had called her, back when Liora still believed in unlocking things instead of breaking them. [340]
But some locks *needed* breaking. [344]

She exhaled, slow and deliberate, and began to pull. [350]
The memories fought her, stretching like taffy, their edges blurring as they tore free. [360]
The chamber trembled. Dust rained from the ceiling, and the threads snapped one by one, unraveling into the air like smoke. [375]
The Bone Fountain outside groaned, its dry basin filling not with water, but with sound—the echoes of a thousand voices, suddenly unmuzzled. [393]

Liora stepped back, the stained glass box now dark and quiet in her palm. [403]
The city’s fountains, long silent, began to weep. [408]
Not water. [410]
Light. [411]

She didn’t wait to see what happened next. [416]
Some things, once unstuck, couldn’t be contained. [421]
And Liora had never been good at staying where she was told. [428]

The geese would return eventually, their wings cutting the sky into new shapes. [438]
But for now, the city breathed. [441]
And so did she. [443] </story>
