The silo stood like a forgotten needle in the earth, its emerald patina dulled by decades of neglect, though the air around it hummed with a quiet, stubborn energy. [31]

Elias Voss adjusted the cracked lens of his pocket watch—his grandfather’s, then his father’s, now his, though it hadn’t ticked in years—not because he needed the time, but because the ritual soothed the ache of knowing he was running out of it. [72]

He wasn’t supposed to be here. [77]

The silo had been condemned after the numbers changed meaning, when clocks began counting backward or sideways, when people woke to find their birthdays un-celebrated, their scars fresh again. [108]

Elias, a timekeeper by trade (or by curse, depending on the day), had spent his life stitching together the frayed edges of moments for others—resetting alarms for the sleepless, winding heirloom watches for the grieving, whispering the correct hour into the ears of the confused. [156]

But he couldn’t fix his own. [161]

The urn fragment in his coat pocket was warm, as if the ashes inside still held a spark. [172]

He’d found it at a garage sale three towns over, tucked between a chipped teapot and a stack of yellowed sheet music, its price tag scribbled in looping cursive: *"For the one who counts what cannot be held. Ask about the silo."* [213]

The seller, a woman with eyes like cracked porcelain, had pressed it into his palm and said, *"Some things aren’t lost. [225] They’re just waiting to be rediscovered."* [230]

Now, standing in the silo’s shadow, Elias traced the urn’s jagged edge where the name *MARLEN* had been etched before the fire—or the collapse, or whatever had turned the world’s timeline to static. [257]

Inside, the silo’s rusted door groaned open on its own, revealing a spiral staircase coiled like a fossilized spring. [272]

He climbed. [274]

The walls were lined with garage sale detritus: a child’s mittens still damp with melted snow, a vinyl record labeled *"The Last Waltz (Before the Skip)"*, a pocket mirror reflecting a face that wasn’t his. [299]

Then he saw them—dozens of tiny, deliberate scratches in the metal, each beside an item. [309]

*"Toothbrush—remember the taste of mint." [315] "Broken compass—north is wherever you’re headed next." [321] "Wedding ring—love doesn’t dissolve, it evaporates."* [329]

Messages. [331]

Embedded in the descriptions of things no one wanted, by someone who’d understood: time wasn’t a line. [342]

It was a garage sale. [345]

A place where the past was priced to move, where the future was a handwritten receipt fluttering in the wind. [357]

At the top of the stairs, a single bulb flickered, casting long shadows over a workbench. [367]

There, half-buried under blueprints of clocks that couldn’t exist, sat a time capsule—or what was left of it. [380]

The metal was split open like an overripe fruit, its contents spilled: a child’s drawing of a tree with roots stretching into tomorrow, a train ticket to a station that no longer existed, and a pocket watch identical to Elias’s, its face shattered. [415]

His breath hitched. [417]

The capsule wasn’t damaged. [419]

It was *unfinished*. [421]

A note, brittle with age, read: *"I ran out of time before I could explain the texture of it. [433] The way it sticks to your fingers like honey, then slips away like smoke. [442] Find the others. [444] They’re still counting."* [446]

Elias’s fingers trembled as he picked up the twin of his watch. [452]

For the first time in years, it tickled. [455]

Not with the steady march of seconds, but with something wilder—like a heartbeat after a long sleep, or a held note finally released. [473]

He understood then: Marlen hadn’t been preserving time. [479]

She’d been *unraveling* it. [481]

Not to erase the past, but to weave it into something new. [487]

The silo wasn’t a tomb. [490]

It was a loom. [492]

Elias exhaled, his breath visible in the suddenly timeless air, and began to wind the broken watch. [504]

Somewhere, a garage sale bell rang. [508]

Somewhere else, a clock began to chime—forward, backward, all at once. [518]

He smiled. [520]

There was work to do. [523]

The urn fragment in his pocket grew warmer. [528]
