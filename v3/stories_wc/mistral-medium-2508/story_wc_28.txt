The plaza had once been a jewel—now it was a wound. [10]

Beneath the shattered sky, where the smoke still curled like a dying prayer, Elias knelt on the mosaic stepping stones, his calloused fingers tracing the chipped patterns. [26]

The tesserae—tiny fragments of glass and stone—had survived the great fire, though the minaret they once adorned now stood skeletal, its voice of prayer silenced. [45]

He was a gentle radical, the kind who carried a surgeon’s precision in his hands and a heretic’s compassion in his chest. [61]

The others called him *the Mender*, but he had no name for himself anymore, not after the fire took the last of them. [78]

He was retrocognitively trapped, haunted by the echoes of what *had* been—children laughing in the courtyard, the imam’s voice rising like incense, the scent of bread from the ovens before the flames devoured it all. [104]

Now, only the stones remembered. [108]

Elias pressed his palm to a fractured tessera—a sliver of cobalt blue, once part of the minaret’s eye. [121]

The mosaic was a map, if you knew how to read the cracks. [128]

He had learned. [130]

The great fire had not been an accident. [134]

The city’s rulers had called it *mercy*—a purging of the unworthy, the weak, the ones who dared to weep when the edicts demanded silence. [152]

Elias called it *aberrant*. [155]

Mercy should cradle, not consume. [159]

His fingers found the pattern: a spiral of broken green and gold, the path the fire had taken. [172]

If he renamed the dead—if he spoke their names into the stones—the plaza might remember *them* instead of the ashes. [190]

He began with the baker’s daughter, Aisha, who had pressed a loaf into his hands the morning the torches came. [208]

“You,” he whispered to the tessera, “are *Aisha’s smile*.” [216]

The stone warmed beneath his touch. [219]

The method was simple: find the fracture, speak the truth, let the mosaic rewrite itself in memory. [233]

The soldiers had called it witchcraft when they caught him the first time. [241]

They broke two of his fingers before he convinced them it was only grief. [249]

(They did not understand that grief, too, could be a weapon.) [257]

The plaza shifted around him as he worked, the air thick with the scent of charred cedar and something older—dust, and the ghost of rain. [275]

He moved to the next stone, this one veined with cracks like lightning. [283]

“You,” he murmured, “are *Farid’s stubbornness*.” [290]

The old storyteller had refused to flee, insisting the fire would spare a man who had spent a lifetime laughing at tyrants. [308]

(It had not.) [310]

Elias’s breath fogged in the cold, but his hands did not tremble. [318]

Steel lived in his bones now, forged in the fire’s aftermath—not for vengeance, but for this: the slow, defiant act of *holding*. [333]

The tesserae pulsed faintly, as if the plaza itself were breathing. [341]

A shadow fell across the stones. [344]

Elias did not look up. [346]

“They’ll kill you for this,” said a voice, rough as burnt parchment. [353]

He recognized the commander’s boots—scuffed leather, still flecked with the blood of the last dissenters. [364]

“Then I’ll be in good company,” Elias replied, pressing his thumb to another fragment. [374]

“You,” he said, “are *Layla’s courage*.” [380]

The commander’s sword hissed from its sheath, but the blade wavered. [387]

The stones were humming now, a chorus of the lost. [393]

Elias met the man’s eyes. [395]

“Go ahead,” he said. [397]

“But know this: mercy isn’t what you burn. [402]

It’s what you *carry*.” [404]

The sword clattered to the ground. [407]

The commander knelt, his calloused hands—so like Elias’s—reaching for a tessera of his own. [418]

“You,” he whispered, voice breaking, “are *my son’s name*.” [426]

The plaza held them both, cradling their sorrow in arms of steel and shattered light. [437]

Above, the sky remained broken. [440]

But the stones began to glow. [443]

One by one, the cracks filled with gold. [447]

The great fire had tried to erase them. [451]

Instead, it had made them *unforgettable*. [454]

Elias smiled. [455]

The work was only beginning. [458]
