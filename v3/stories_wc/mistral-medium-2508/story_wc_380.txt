The lantern lighter moved through the docks like a shadow with a flame, his brass hook clicking against the iron rings as he lit each wick. [20]
The night air smelled of salt and rotting kelp, thickened by the whale that had beached at dawn—its skeleton already half-picked clean by gulls and scavengers. [40]
His pockets bulged with things he shouldn’t carry: a vial of coffee grounds, a fold of pressed wildflowers, and a stone that weighed more some nights than others. [60]

The stone was the key. [63]
He’d found it in the salt crystal chamber beneath the docks, where the air hummed and the walls grew in jagged patterns, as if time itself had frozen mid-drip. [83]
The foreman called it a flaw in the harvest, but the lighter knew better—those crystals didn’t just grow; they *pulled*. [98]
Little pockets of gravity, fluctuating mysteriously, tugging at the edges of things people tried to forget. [110]

His wife’s voice had been the first to vanish. [115]
Not all at once, but in fragments—her laugh dissolving mid-chuckle, the way she’d hummed while braiding her hair slipping like sand through his fingers. [130]
The doctors called it grief. [133]
The dockworkers called it bad luck. [136]
But in the gleaming silence of the crystal chamber, he’d seen the truth: memories didn’t fade. [145]
They were *excavated*. [147]

That was why he’d started digging. [151]
Not with a shovel—no, the things he sought were buried in patterns, not dirt. [159]
Every morning, he brewed coffee thick as mud, let the grounds settle, and read the fractures like a map. [170]
The wildflowers were his compass; their petals curled toward the heaviest pull, the place where the gravity pooled like ink in water. [183]
Tonight, the stone in his pocket was a lead weight. [189]
Tonight, he would exhume what was left of her. [194]

The chamber door groaned open, its hinges crusty with salt. [200]
Inside, the crystals jutted from the walls in grotesque blooms, their facets catching the lantern light and scattering it into a thousand silent stars. [215]
He knelt where the pull was strongest, where the air tasted like ozone and old pennies. [224]
The coffee grounds had led him here, their spirals tight and desperate. [230]
He pressed the wildflowers into the salt-crusted floor and waited. [237]

The weight in his pocket *shifted*. [241]
Not his imagination—it lurched, as if something beneath him had taken a breath. [249]
The crystals trembled. [251]
A sound like tearing paper filled the chamber, and then— [256]
*—her name*. [258]

It wasn’t a voice. [260]
It was a *shape*, a ripple in the gravity, pressing against his ribs from the inside. [268]
He gasped, clutching the stone as the chamber seemed to tilt, the pockets of gravity yawning wide. [278]
The wildflowers blackened at the edges. [281]
The coffee grounds swirled into a vortex, and for a heartbeat, he saw her— [288]
—not as she’d been, but as she *was*: a silhouette in the dark, her hands outstretched, her mouth open in a scream that had no sound. [305]

Then the stone *shook* itself apart in his grip, dissolving into dust. [313]
The gravity snapped back. [315]
The chamber was just a chamber again, the crystals dull, the air stale. [322]
On the floor, the wildflowers had crumbled to ash. [327]
Only the coffee grounds remained, scattered in a pattern he didn’t recognize. [335]

He sat there until his lantern guttered. [339]
The whale’s bones would be gone by morning, picked clean. [344]
The docks would forget the beast had ever washed ashore. [349]
He lit another wick, then another, his hands steady. [355]
Some things, he knew now, weren’t meant to be found. [360]
Not because they were lost, but because they were *taken*. [365]

Back at the docks, he emptied his pockets into the tide. [371]
The saltwater hissed as it swallowed the last of the coffee grounds, the wildflower ash. [379]
The stone—or what was left of it—sank without a ripple. [385]
The lantern lighter watched the waves a while longer. [389]
Then he got back to work. [391]

The wicks still needed lighting. [394]
The night was long. [396]
And the gravity, he’d learned, was always hungry. [400]

---
By the time the next whale beached, he’d be ready. [406]
He’d have new flowers pressed flat in his pocket. [410]
New grounds to read. [412]
New patterns to follow into the dark. [416]

Because some memories weren’t deleted. [420]
They were *stored*. [422]
And he would find the ledger. [425]
Even if it killed him. [427]

(He suspected it would.) [429]

The tide rolled in, gleaming and silent. [433]
The lanterns burned on. [435]
And far below, in the salt and the dark, something *stirred*. [441] </story>
