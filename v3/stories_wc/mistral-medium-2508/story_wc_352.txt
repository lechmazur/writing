The archivist’s fingers traced the manuscript’s edge, where ink had bled into the shape of a coiled eye—doodled in haste, or perhaps in warning. [30]

Lysara had spent seventeen years deciphering texts that resisted translation, but this one hummed beneath her touch, its margins pulsing with a light too faint for others to see. [60]

She called it *prism-mind*, the way her thoughts fractured into spectra when she stared too long at the page, each facet revealing a new angle of the impossible. [90]

The doodle wasn’t decoration; it was a key. [98]

That night, when the mist curled through the valley like a living thing, Lysara followed the manuscript’s whisper to the serpentine grotto—a cave mouth lined with teeth of quartz, its walls slick with condensation that refracted the moon’s sickle into jagged rainbows. [150]

She stepped inside as the world tilted: gravity inverted, pulling her hair toward the ceiling as loose pebbles floated like startled fish. [175]

An hour. [177]

That was how long the phenomenon lasted, according to the village elders who spoke of it in hushed tones, as if naming it might summon worse. [200]

Lysara didn’t fear the inversion; she feared running out of time. [209]

The grotto’s depths twisted like a gut, its air thick with the scent of damp earth and something older—ozone, maybe, or the ghost of lightning. [230]

Her lantern’s flame stretched unnaturally tall, its light *clandestinely luminous*, casting shadows that moved before she did. [245]

At the heart of the grotto stood a threshold: a ring of mushrooms bioluminescent and blue, their caps arranged in a sequence that mirrored the doodle’s curves. [268]

She knelt, pressing the manuscript’s margin to the glow. [275]

The page drank the light. [278]

A breath later, the air *ripped*—not like fabric, but like a held note suddenly released—and Lysara was falling *upward*, through the ceiling of the world, into a chamber where the walls were lined with shelves of glass. [310]

Each jar held a seed, but not the kind that sprouted plants. [319]

These were *combinations*: forgotten alchemies of sound and silence, pressure and release, the kind of knowledge that didn’t just vanish but *hid*, burying itself in the crevices between what was known and what could be. [350]

Her prism-mind splintered further, each shard recognizing a different pattern—a seed that, if planted in the right silence, would grow into a weapon; another that, if swallowed, would let a person *reenter* a moment already lived. [385]

Lysara’s hands trembled. [388]

She hadn’t come for power. [391]

She’d come because the manuscript had shown her a vision: her brother’s face, the last time she’d seen him, stepping through a doorway that shouldn’t have existed, his voice saying, *“Find where the combinations hide.”* [420]

The seeds pulsed in their jars, responding to her grief like iron to a lodestone. [433]

She reached for one—just one—but the grotto groaned. [440]

Gravity righted itself with a snap. [443]

The threshold collapsed into dust. [446]

Lysara lunged, fingers brushing a jar as the chamber sealed itself behind her, the seeds winking out like extinguished stars. [460]

She crashed back into the grotto’s mouth, the manuscript now blank except for a single, smudged print where her brother’s thumb had pressed the page years ago. [480]

The mist swallowed her scream. [483]

Dawn found her at the village well, washing ink from her hands, her prism-mind quiet for the first time in years. [495]

The elders would call her mad if she spoke of seeds or inverted skies, so she said nothing. [508]

But that night, she lit a candle and held the smudge to the flame. [517]

The paper blackened—then *blossomed*. [520]

A single seed, no larger than a teardrop, rested in the ash. [528]

Lysara cupped it in her palm. [531]

Some doors only opened when you stopped looking for them. [538]

She would plant it in the grotto’s dark, where the mist could feed it secrets. [550]

And when the next inversion came, she would *reenter* not as a seeker, but as a key. [562]

The manuscript’s margins stayed empty after that. [568]

It had given her all it could. [571]

Now the work was hers. [574]

(She dreamed of her brother that night, his voice clear as glass: *“You’re close.”*) [585]

The seed glowed between her ribs, waiting. [590]
