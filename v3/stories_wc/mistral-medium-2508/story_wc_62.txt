The gravestone carver knelt in the damp earth of the ancient greenhouse, his chisel paused above the half-finished name. [16]
Dusk bled through the cracked glass, painting the stone in hues of bruised violet, the air thick with the scent of wet soil and fading jasmine. [32]
His fingers, calloused from decades of work, twitched—not from fatigue, but from the weight of the question gnawing at him: *Could grief be carved?* [50]
The woven ribbon roll lay coiled beside his tools, its edges frayed from years of being passed between his family’s hands at dinner. [68]
Each thread held a poem, a voice, a ghost. [73]

Tonight, the first butterflies of the migration would arrive, their wings like stained glass against the twilight. [84]
His grandmother had called them "the breath of the dead," a belief that had once made him scoff but now settled in his bones like truth. [101]
He retraced the letters on the stone—*Liora*—his sister’s name, though she’d been gone fifteen years. [115]
The chisel slipped. [117]
A crack split the granite, jagged as the scream he’d never let himself voice when they found her body in the river. [130]

The greenhouse shuddered. [132]
Not from wind, but from the presence coiling around him, a pressure like the moment before thunder breaks. [144]
*"You’re holding the chisel wrong."* [148]
The voice was his father’s, though his father had been dust for a decade. [157]
The carver didn’t startle. [159]
Spectral mentorship was a family custom older than the ribbon roll, a tradition of the dead teaching the living what they’d failed to in life. [176]
His father’s hands—translucent, veined with starlight—closed over his, adjusting his grip. [186]
*"Grief isn’t a line. It’s the space between them."* [193]

The carver exhaled. [195]
The butterflies began to arrive, their wings whispering against the glass like pages turning. [106]
He reached for the ribbon roll, unspooling it until he found the poem his sister had loved: *"The dead do not leave us. They become the hollows we pour ourselves into."* [223]
His father’s form flickered, his voice softening. *"You’ve been carving names. But names are just the edges of the story."* [239]
The carver understood. [241]
He set the chisel to the stone again, not to etch letters, but to hollow out the space around them—a void shaped like absence, like breath held too long. [259]

Outside, the migration thickened, a river of wings blocking the last of the light. [268]
The greenhouse became a lantern, the butterflies’ patterns projecting onto the walls like constellations. [278]
His father’s specter began to dissolve, but not before pressing a single butterfly into the carver’s palm. [290]
*"Trade this at dinner,"* he murmured. *"The living need to learn how to hold what’s already gone."* [303]

The carver stood, the butterfly pulsing against his skin. [308]
He rolled the ribbon back up, tucking his sister’s poem inside, then added his own beneath it: *"I will carve the hollows until they become a shape we can all live in."* [330]
The stone before him was no longer a marker, but a vessel—a place where grief could gather, not as a weight, but as a current. [347]

As he stepped from the greenhouse, the first drops of rain began to fall, each one striking the butterflies’ wings like a chisel on stone. [363]
The thunder arrived not as sound, but as a vibration in his ribs, the echo of a hundred voices reciting poems at a table long abandoned. [380]
He walked toward the house, where his daughter would be setting the table, where the ribbon roll would be passed again. [396]
The migration would last three days. [399]
By the end, he would teach her how to listen for the hollows. [405]

That night, as the family traded verses over steamed rice and salted plums, the carver placed the butterfly on the table. [420]
His daughter’s fingers trembled as she took it, her eyes reflecting the storm outside. [430]
*"It’s beautiful,"* she whispered. [433]
He smiled. *"It’s ours."* [435]
And for the first time, the shape of collective grief didn’t feel like a wound, but a door—one they could open together, again and again, as the butterflies returned each year, as the stone weathered, as the poems multiplied like roots beneath the earth. [465]
The thunder rolled, not in warning, but in confirmation. [471]
The dead were not gone. [474]
They were the hands guiding the chisel, the breath in the hollows, the poems on the ribbon unspooling toward the future. [489]
And the carver, at last, let himself be led. [493] </story>
