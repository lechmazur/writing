The observatory hummed with the weight of silence, its brass telescopes angled toward a sky too bright with afternoon sun to reveal anything but the ghost of the moon. [25]

Lydia Voss adjusted her cufflinks—her father’s, engraved with the masthead of the *Chronicle*—and traced the grain of the rosewood pen nib resting beside her ledger. [48]

It had been her mother’s, the only thing left after the fire that took the pressroom and, with it, the last unburned draft of her exposé on the mayor’s land deals. [75]

The journalist had called an hour ago, his voice crackling through the observatory’s old switchboard: *"They’re saying you inherited the paper to bury the story. Prove me wrong."* [100]

Lydia exhaled, watching her breath fog the glass dome above. [106]

She was devotedly observant—not of stars, but of patterns: the way her father’s ledgers always balanced *too* neatly, the way the mayor’s secretary flinched when Lydia mentioned the fire. [135]

Regret was an orbit, she’d decided. [139]

You could trace its path forever, always circling the thing you’d failed to say or do, close enough to see its edges but never to touch it. [158]

The pen nib glinted as she picked it up, its tip still sharp after decades. [167]

Proof by contradiction, her logic professor had called it: assume the opposite of what you suspect, then dismantle the lie until only the truth remains. [188]

She’d start with the ledgers. [191]

The observatory’s acoustics carried every sound—her chair’s creak, the whisper of pages, the distant *clink* of the caretaker’s tea cup two floors below. [210]

If the *Chronicle* had been silenced for a bribe, the numbers would betray it. [220]

But the columns were pristine, each entry inked in her father’s precise hand, right down to the final, damning line: *"Final payment—V. Estate."* [241]

Her stomach twisted. [243]

The journalist had been right to doubt her. [247]

She could let the orbit of regret pull her under—let the paper die with the truth—or she could intervene. [260]

Lydia dipped the rosewood nib into the inkwell and began a new ledger. [268]

Not of expenses, but of questions: *Why would Father sell the pressroom’s lease the week before the fire?* *Why did the mayor’s nephew start at the Chronicle as a typesetter the same month?* [293]

The caretaker’s shadow stretched long across the floor as the sun dipped. [302]

"Miss Voss," he said, voice echoing, "there’s a man downstairs. [310]

Says he’s got the ’98 printing plates. [315]

The ones your mother hid." [318]

Lydia’s pulse jumped. [320]

The plates would hold the draft—the proof. [324]

She descended the spiral stairs, the pen nib warm in her palm, her steps light despite the weight of what she carried: not just ink, but the chance to break the orbit. [348]

The man in the foyer smelled of machine oil and old newsprint. [355]

He slid a rusted tin box across the table. [359]

Inside, the zinc plates gleamed, their etched headlines accusatory: *"MAYOR’S SHELL COMPANIES LINKED TO ARSON RING."* [373]

Her mother’s final story. [376]

Lydia laughed, a sound half relief, half grief. [381]

The journalist had asked for proof. [384]

Now she had it—not by chasing the truth, but by assuming its absence and watching the lies collapse. [403]

She dipped the nib once more and wrote a single line in the new ledger: *"The orbit breaks here."* [416]

Outside, the first stars prickled through the twilight, indifferent witnesses. [424]

The *Chronicle* would run the story tomorrow. [428]

And Lydia? [430]

She’d keep the pen nib, the ledger, the habit of watching—not the sky, but the spaces between what was said and what was meant. [450]

Regret was an orbit, yes. [453]

But orbits could be escaped. [456]

All it took was the right leverage—and the will to push. [462]

The caretaker handed her a cup of tea, steam curling like the trails of comets she’d never bothered to chart. [478]

"To new beginnings," he said. [481]

Lydia clinked her cup against his, the sound sharp and certain as the strike of a typesetter’s hammer. [496]

The past was a closed ledger. [499]

The future? [500]

That was tomorrow’s ink. [502]

She blew on the tea and smiled. [505]
