The canyon breathed before dawn, its walls of bone humming with the weight of unspoken names. [15]

Liora crouched on a jagged rib of the lowest tower, her fingers chalked with the dust of old carvings, tracing the curve of a forgotten sigil. [32]
She was the only one who still defied the silence—not with shouts, but with the scrape of charcoal on stone, the whisper of verses that refused to die. [52]
Above her, the pale spire pierced the mist like a needle drawing thread from the sky, its surface slick with the condensation of a thousand held breaths. [74]
The elders called it the *Needle of Absolution*, but Liora called it a lie. [83]

She had been innocently mischievous once, slipping poems into the prayer bowls of the penitent, watching their faces twist when the words refract through the ritual’s light. [104]
*"Forgiveness is a mirror,"* she’d written, *"but who decides which face it shows?"* [114]
They had beaten her knuckles raw for that, but the question had already taken root. [123]

Now, before the ritual, the canyon held its breath. [128]
The elders would gather at the spire’s base, their voices droning the old litanies while the mist swallowed the echoes whole. [142]
Liora knew the truth: the spire didn’t absolve. [148]
It refracted—split the weight of guilt into shards so fine no one could grasp them, let alone cast them off. [163]
A single truth, splintered into many, until responsibility dissolved like salt in the endless echoes. [175]

She pressed her palm to the bone beneath her, feeling the vibration of the coming chant. [185]
The towers were not built; they were grown, fed by the sins of the contrite, their marrow thick with confessions never spoken aloud. [202]
Liora had spent years listening, her ears tuned to the fractures in their voices, the way their regrets refract through the canyon’s hollows. [220]
She had collected them—phrases, half-truths, the names of the forgotten—and woven them into something sharper. [233]

The first notes of the ritual rose, a low thrum that set her teeth on edge. [242]
Liora stood, brushing dust from her knees, and began to climb. [249]
Not toward the spire, but sideways, along the lattice of bones where the elders wouldn’t look. [260]
Her breath came quick, her pulse a counterpoint to the chant below. [269]
She had one chance: to reach the fissure in the third tower, where the bone was thin enough to carve, and the echoes would carry her words like arrows. [289]

The elders’ voices swelled, the mist thickening as the spire began to glow—a sickly, opalescent light that promised release. [305]
Liora pressed her forehead to the cold bone and whispered the first line, letting the canyon refract it into a hundred overlapping voices. [323]
*"You called it mercy, but mercy doesn’t ask for payment."* [332]
The chant faltered. [334]
She carved faster, her fingers bleeding, the words spilling out in a rush: *"The spire doesn’t take your sin. It scatters it, so no one bears the weight. Not even you."* [358]
The light above pulsed, unstable. [361]
The elders screamed, but their voices were lost in the sudden cacophony of echoes—every confession, every half-truth, every name they’d buried now twisting back upon them. [382]

Liora didn’t watch the spire shatter. [387]
She knew the price of forgiveness was never the sinner’s to pay. [395]
As the mist swallowed the screams, she descended, her hands empty, her heart lighter than the bone-dust settling around her. [412]
The canyon would remember now. [416]
And so would they. [418]

At the base of the tower, she picked up her charcoal and began to write again, her strokes defiant in the forged hush. [433]
The next poem would be about the cost of truth. [440]
And this time, she wouldn’t hide it in the bowls. [446]
She would carve it into the spire’s remains, where the light would refract it forever. [458]
