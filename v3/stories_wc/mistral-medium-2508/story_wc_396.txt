The lighthouse stood sentinel over the orchard, its gnarled apple trees clinging to the cliffside like old men gripping walking sticks, their roots tangled in the salt-cracked earth above the shifting ice floes below. [32]

Elias Veyne—peacekeeper of the Hollow Coast—paused at the threshold, his gloved fingers brushing the frost that rimmed the doorframe, his shadow stretching long and unnaturally still behind him, as if the light itself hesitated to claim him. [68]

Inside, the air smelled of wax and damp wool, the beam above spinning its slow, methodical warning to ships that never came anymore. [88]

On the worktable lay the fragment: a jagged sliver of crystal ball, its once-smooth surface now webbed with fractures that caught the light like trapped screams. [110]

Elias exhaled, watching his breath curl and dissipate—the weighted breath before reply, the space where doubt lived. [127]

He’d found it in the wreckage of the old seer’s hut, half-buried under snowdrift, humming faintly when he touched it. [145]

The villagers called him shadow-laced, not as insult but fact; his presence dulled conflicts before they bloomed, his quiet voice unraveling knots of anger like loose thread. [169]

But this—this fragment was different. [174]

It didn’t soothe. [176]

It *showed*. [178]

In the vintage store mirrors he’d collected over the years—each one warped by time, each one hung at odd angles in the lighthouse tower—he’d glimpsed the same scene: a child, no older than ten, standing on the ice as it groaned and split beneath her, her hands outstretched not in fear but in *offering*. [226]

The visions came in flashes, never the full truth, but Elias knew the pattern of courage when he saw it. [242]

The girl was an anomaly, a spark in the dark, and the ice wanted her. [250]

He turned the fragment in his palms, feeling the way it pulsed against his skin, as if it recognized a kindred thing in him. [266]

To reconstitute it—to make it whole again—would require more than skill. [275]

It would demand he map empathy onto action, not just observe but *intervene*. [285]

The mirrors whispered as he passed them, their surfaces rippling with half-formed reflections: the child’s face, the crack in the ice, the moment her fingers brushed something beneath the surface. [309]

Elias had spent a lifetime being calmly intuitive, reading the unspoken currents of a room, but this was different. [326]

This was *choice*. [329]

He descended the spiral stairs, the fragment tucked into his coat, its hum syncing with the rhythm of his steps. [345]

Outside, the orchard trees swayed in a wind that wasn’t there, their branches clicking like bones. [358]

The ice floes below groaned, restless, hungry. [363]

Elias knew the girl would come at dusk, when the light bent just so and the world held its breath. [375]

He would be waiting. [378]

Not as a peacekeeper, not as a shadow, but as the one foolish enough to step onto the ice with her. [391]

The fragment warmed against his chest, its fractures glowing faintly, as if it already understood what he would do. [407]

He would reconstitute more than the crystal. [412]

He would reconstitute the moment itself—rewrite the ending where the brave thing didn’t have to stand alone. [425]

The beam above swept the horizon, a silent metronome counting down. [434]

Elias closed his eyes and listened to the ice breathe. [440]

When he opened them, the first stars were appearing, sharp and unblinking, like pins in a map. [453]

He adjusted the mirrors one last time, angling them toward the cliff’s edge, toward the place where courage and ruin balanced on a knife’s edge. [473]

The girl would come. [476]

And this time, she wouldn’t have to offer herself to the dark alone. [486]

Elias touched the fragment, then his own shadow, and smiled. [493]

The ice groaned again, closer now, eager. [499]

He stepped forward, into the space between seeing and doing. [506]

The mirrors shattered behind him, their glimpses finally whole. [514]
