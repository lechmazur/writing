The wind howled through the skeletal trees of the wasteland orchard, their gnarled branches heavy with fruit that glowed faintly under the radioactive twilight. [23]
Elias Voss adjusted his cracked goggles, the lenses smeared with dust but still sharp enough to catch the way the light bent around the orchard’s center—a patch of stillness where the air didn’t shimmer with fallout. [48]
He’d spent a decade dismantling conspiracies, peeling back the hysteria of the Liquidation to reveal the banal horrors beneath: not secret cabals, but bureaucrats with spreadsheets, signing off on poisoned wells. [78]
Yet here he stood, knee-deep in the myth of the *Hollow Star*—a flawed diamond said to whisper to its owners, said to have been buried by a physicist who’d called the stillpoint "the eye of the storm." [110]
Elias didn’t believe in curses. [114]
But he believed in patterns. [117]
The letters had arrived that morning, shredded into confetti by some overzealous censor’s blade, the envelopes postmarked from the orchard’s last caretaker—a woman who’d vanished the night the evacuation sirens failed. [142]
He’d spent hours piecing them together on the hood of his rusted truck, fingers sticky with sap from the fruit he’d been eating raw to stave off the nausea of the dust. [165]
*"The stone isn’t the curse,"* one reconstructed sentence read. *"The stillpoint is what they’re hiding. Not from us. For us."* [183]
Elias wiped his hands on his coat and stepped into the calm. [191]
The air here was thick, not with radiation but with something older—ozone, maybe, or the ghost of static from dead machines. [205]
His boots crunched over glass, not sand: shattered vials, their labels faded to illegibility. [215]
Then he saw the pit. [218]
Six feet wide, lined with lead sheets stamped with the old Atomic Energy Commission’s insignia, and at the bottom, half-buried in the dirt, the diamond. [236]
It wasn’t glowing. [239]
It wasn’t even impressive—just a lump of carbon with a jagged crack down its face, catching the light like a broken mirror. [253]
But when Elias reached for it, his fingers didn’t close. [259]
The stillpoint *pushed back*. [262]
Not with force. With *meaning*. [265]
Images flickered: the caretaker, not dead but *unspooling*, her body dissolving into the same static that hummed in the air; the physicist, not burying the diamond but *sealing* something beneath it; the Liquidation not an accident but a quarantine. [293]
Elias’s breath came fast. [296]
He’d built a career on exposing lies people told to feel safe, but this—this was the lie that kept them *alive*. [312]
The diamond wasn’t cursed. [315]
The stillpoint was a valve. [318]
And the thing beneath it was waking up. [322]
His radio crackled. [324]
A voice, distorted but familiar—the same tone as the letters: *"You were always good at seeing what others missed, Voss. But do you *listen*?"* [343]
Elias exhaled. [345]
He’d come to dig up a trinket for his next exposé. [350]
Instead, he knelt, pressed his palm to the diamond, and let the stillpoint show him how to turn the key. [363]
The orchard’s fruit had been thriving for a reason. [369]
The roots went deeper than the soil. [373]
When the first tremor hit, Elias didn’t run. [378]
He started laughing, because of course the truth wasn’t a conspiracy. [386]
It was a *garden*. [388]
And every lie he’d ever debunked had been fertilizer. [393]
The ground split open. [396]
Something green and glistening uncoiled from the dark, smelling of rain and electricity, and Elias Voss—conspiracy debunker, skeptic, man who’d made a religion of disbelief—finally understood. [428]
The stillpoint wasn’t hiding the curse. [433]
It was hiding the *cure*. [436]
He reached out. [438]
The last thing he saw before the light took him was his own reflection in the diamond’s flaw—not broken, but *refracted*, multiplied into a dozen possible versions of himself, all reaching back. [465]
When the dust storm passed three days later, the orchard was gone. [473]
So was Elias Voss. [476]
The only thing left was a single, perfect fruit on the dashboard of his abandoned truck, its skin smooth and unmarked, humming faintly with the sound of a heartbeat. [499]
Somewhere, a radio tower no one had used in years sparked to life. [508]
A voice, clear as water: *"You’re next."* [514]
Then static. [516]
Then silence. [518]
Then, beneath the silence, the sound of something *growing*. [525]
