The repair bay hummed with the ghost of machinery, its rusted girders groaning like bones in the murmur of half-remembered dreams. [18]

Liora traced her fingers along the wall, her sensory map unfolding in her mind—a lattice of vibrations, scents, and the faintest electric thrum of worlds brushing against this one. [39]

She wasn’t supposed to be here, not in this abandoned spaceport where the air tasted of ozone and old grease, but the pull had been cyclically spontaneous, a tide she couldn’t resist. [63]

Her boot heel struck something sharp. [67]

A green glass shard winked up at her, its edges catching the sickly glow of the bay’s dying lights—too perfect, too *intentional*. [85]

Liora’s pulse quickened. [88]

She knew this fragment. [91]

Three months ago, in a parallel universe where the sky bled violet, she’d watched a man shatter a bottle just like it against a docking clamp before he whispered, *"They’re rewriting the seams."* [113]

Then he’d vanished mid-sentence, his voice redirecting into static. [121]

She pocketed the shard. [124]

The weight of it was wrong—not in grams, but in *meaning*. [131]

Liora’s maps weren’t just spatial; they were narratives, threads of cause and effect stretched between worlds. [143]

This shard was a knot in the weave, a truth someone had torn out and left behind. [155]

She pressed her palm to the cold metal of a collapsed cargo lift, letting her senses spiral outward—there, the faintest resonance of the man’s voice, still echoing in the substructure of reality. [179]

*"Follow the static,"* he’d said. [184]

The bay’s intercom crackled. [187]

A voice, distorted but familiar: *"You weren’t supposed to find that."* [195]

Liora didn’t flinch. [198]

She’d spent a lifetime learning how to listen to the spaces between words. [207]

The speaker hissed, then fell silent. [212]

On the far wall, a shadow detached itself—no, not a shadow. [219]

A *seam*. [221]

A jagged tear in the air, humming with the same green-tinged light as the shard. [231]

She stepped toward it. [234]

The weight in her pocket grew heavier, not with mass, but with *promise*. [244]

This was why she’d come: to discover the weight of a withheld truth. [254]

The seam pulsed. [257]

Liora exhaled and reached for it— [261]

—only for her fingers to pass through empty air as the tear *redirected*, snapping shut like a trapped animal’s jaws. [276]

The shard in her pocket burned cold. [281]

She pulled it free. [284]

The glass was no longer green. [288]

It was clear now, smooth, unbroken—a lie reabsorbed. [296]

The intercom crackled again. [299]

*"Some doors only open when you stop looking."* [306]

Liora smiled. [309]

She closed her eyes and let her map expand, not outward this time, but *in*— [317]

—where the truth wasn’t a place, but a choice. [324]

The spaceport’s lights flickered. [328]

When they steadied, she was holding two shards: one green, one clear. [338]

The seam reappeared, wider now, humming with possibility. [346]

Liora stepped through. [349]

The air on the other side smelled of rain and burning paper. [356]

A man stood waiting, his face half-remembered. [363]

*"Took you long enough,"* he said, but his voice was warm, his edges solid. [374]

She held up the green shard. [378]

*"You left this behind."* [381]

He touched the glass, and for a second, it was whole again—a bottle, unbroken. [392]

*"I left it for you,"* he corrected. [397]

Liora’s map shivered, rewriting itself around this new anchor point. [407]

The truth wasn’t in the shard, or the seam, or even the words. [417]

It was in the weaving. [420]

She took his hand. [423]

The spaceport dissolved behind them, its rust and whispers unspooling into the dark. [434]

Somewhere, a door clicked shut. [439]

Somewhere else, another opened. [444]

Liora didn’t need to see it to know. [449]

She was the map now. [452]

And the map was endless. [455]

The man squeezed her fingers. [459]

*"Ready?"* [462]

She grinned. [465]

The weight in her chest wasn’t fear. [469]

It was the thrill of the next thread, the next world, the next choice. [479]

The seam between them hummed, alive. [485]

Liora stepped forward— [488]

—and the universe bent to meet her. [494]
