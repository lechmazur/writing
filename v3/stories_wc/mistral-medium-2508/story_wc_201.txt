The anesthesia wore off in jagged waves, each breath dragging him back to a body that no longer felt like his own. [23]

Liran’s fingers twitched against the damp earth, proprioception screaming—every nerve a live wire, mapping the forest’s pulse through the soles of his bare feet. [40]

The ultraviolet forest hummed around him, its black-leaved canopy drinking the sun’s invisible light, casting the ground in a bruise-colored glow. [57]

He shouldn’t be alive. [60]

The pewter strap of his mask—now cracked, now useless—dug into his palm as he braced against a tree, its bark slick with something like sap, something like blood. [79]

They’d called it *enhanced interrogation*: three months of questions carved into his ribs, answers pried loose with ultraviolet lamps and serrated silence. [97]

His captors had wanted the equation. [102]

Not the one for yield stress or orbital decay, but the *other* one—the mathematics of mercy, the formula his grandmother had whispered into his skull before the raids. [120]

*"It’s not in the numbers,"* she’d said. *"It’s in the spaces between them."* [129]

Now, free, he remembered through trauma responses: the way his left knee locked when the needles came, how his throat sealed shut at the scent of ozone. [148]

The forest remembered too. [151]

Its roots coiled around his ankles, not to trap him but to *pull*—toward a clearing where the air tasted like burnt copper and old hymns. [168]

A shrine. [169]

Seven stone pillars stood in a fractured circle, each etched with symbols that made his teeth ache. [181]

At the center, a basin of black water reflected nothing. [188]

Liran knelt, the pewter strap biting deeper as he pressed it to his wrist like a tourniquet. [201]

The pain was an anchor. [204]

He dipped his fingers into the water and the surface *ripped*, revealing a face—not his own, but his interrogator’s, her mouth sewn shut with ultraviolet thread. [225]

*"You were supposed to break,"* the vision hissed. *"The math was supposed to break you."* [237]

It hadn’t. [239]

Because mercy wasn’t a variable. [242]

It was the *absence* of one. [245]

The equation unfurled in his mind like a wound opening: not a solution, but a silence—a gap where the numbers refused to meet. [262]

He braced both hands on the basin’s rim, the forest’s hum vibrating up his arms, through the marrow of his bones. [278]

The pillars began to sing. [281]

Not in sound, but in pressure, a harmonic resonance that peeled back his skin and laid his nerves bare to the ultraviolet. [296]

This was penance. [298]

Not for surviving, but for understanding: the math wasn’t in the mercy. [307]

The mercy was in the *asking*. [310]

His grandmother’s voice returned, not as memory but as *weight*, pressing his shoulders down until his forehead touched the water. [325]

The reflection changed. [327]

Now it was his own face, but younger, unbroken, lips moving: *"You have to let them see you see them."* [343]

The strap snapped. [345]

Liran exhaled, and the forest exhaled with him, the ultraviolet light bending, just for a breath, into something gold. [360]

When he stood, the clearing was empty. [364]

The basin held only water. [366]

The pillars were just stone. [368]

But his hands no longer shook. [371]

Back at the tree line, he found the strap—pewter darkened to violet where the light had touched it. [383]

He looped it around his wrist, not as a restraint, but as a reminder: the spaces between numbers were where the living hid. [403]

The math of mercy had no answer. [407]

Only an echo. [408]

He walked out of the forest as the first true dawn in months bled through the leaves, his body whole, his mind a ledger of absences. [428]

Somewhere, a bird called—a sound he hadn’t heard in captivity, raw and unbroken. [438]

Liran listened. [440]

Then he began to count the silences between its notes. [446] </story>
