The geode sat heavy in Amira's palm, its crystalline interior catching the observatory's sterile light. [14] She'd carried it since Kandahar—the only intact thing pulled from the rubble where her sister's wedding had been. [31] Now, suspended three kilometers above Earth's surface in the atmospheric research station, she pressed it against the quantum scanner's interface. [51]

"Perturbation readings are spiking," Dr. Chen murmured, watching the displays. [61] "Whatever trauma signature that crystal absorbed, it's creating interference patterns I've never seen." [75]

Amira knew why she'd really come here. [82] Not for the grief counseling program advertised to survivors, but to hunt for something the scientists didn't know they'd discovered. [102] The floating observatory's quantum field experiments had accidentally proven what she'd felt since the strike—that violent death leaves traces, pools of unused potential that gather like water in hidden valleys. [134]

The main circuit breakers had blown during today's experiment, leaving them forty minutes of cooling time. [150] Forty minutes to access the restricted scanner without oversight. [159] She'd planned this for months, studying perturbation theory through pirated university lectures, learning how minute disturbances in quantum fields could reveal larger hidden structures. [181]

"The geode's molecular structure," she said, fingers dancing across the controls, "it's not just damaged—it's recording something." [199]

The crystal had been at the epicenter when the missile struck. [210] In that millisecond of impact, as lives ended mid-celebration, mid-dance, mid-laughter, all that unrealized future had to go somewhere. [230] Physics demanded it. [233] Energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed. [239]

The scanner's display shifted, showing probability clouds that shouldn't exist. [249] Dr. Chen stepped back. [253] "This is impossible. [256] These are consciousness patterns, but they're not degrading." [264]

Amira felt it then—the intangibly tangible presence she'd been hunting. [274] Not ghosts exactly, but the weight of unlived moments pressing against reality's thin membrane. [288] Her sister's unborn children. [292] Her brother-in-law's architectural plans. [296] Her mother's unfinished songs. [300] All of it pooling here, in the space between quantum states, waiting. [312]

"You knew," Chen whispered. [316] "You knew the observatory's elevation would make the boundary thinner." [326]

She nodded, adjusting the scanner's frequency. [332] The perturbation patterns were clarifying, showing her exactly where the potential had gathered—not dissipated as science claimed, but concentrated. [351] Waiting to be reclaimed. [355]

An alarm rang out. [359] The cooling cycle was ending early. [365] Security would arrive in minutes. [370]

"Help me," Amira said, her voice steady despite the bleak exhilaration coursing through her. [384] "We can capture it. [388] We can give it back to the world." [396]

Chen hesitated, then began rapidly downloading the data. [404] "They'll destroy this research. [408] Call it contaminated. [411] Call you traumatized." [414]

"Let them." [416] Amira pressed the geode harder against the scanner, feeling it resonate with frequencies that shouldn't exist. [432] The crystal began to glow, not with light but with possibility itself. [444]

The floating observatory shuddered as the circuit breakers re-engaged. [453] Power surged back through the systems, but it was too late to stop what they'd started. [469] The scanner had found the reservoir—vast pools of severed futures orbiting Earth like invisible satellites, drawn to places where violence had stolen tomorrow. [492]

Through the observation deck's windows, Earth curved below, scarred by a thousand conflicts. [505] Each scar hiding its own pool of trapped potential. [514] Amira had found the first one, proved they existed. [523] The hunt could begin in earnest now. [530]

"This changes everything," Chen breathed, watching the data stream. [539] "If we can harness even a fraction of what was lost—" [550]

"We don't harness it," Amira interrupted, clutching the now-warm geode. [560] "We return it. [563] We let it flow back into the world that was robbed." [574]

Security burst through the doors, but she smiled. [582] The data was already transmitted, scattered to a hundred servers. [592] The unfiltered awakening had begun. [597] Tomorrow's stolen dreams would find new dreamers. [604] The unused potential would pool no more in darkness, but flood back into the light. [619] Her sister's last gift—a geode that remembered how to hope. [630]
