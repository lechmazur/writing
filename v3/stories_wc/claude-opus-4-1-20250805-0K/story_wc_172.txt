The salt stretched endlessly beneath Vera Ashworth's boots, each step crunching through crystalline crust that had once been a thriving wetland. [19] She adjusted the climate-sealed case containing the last Carolina parakeet egg, its turquoise shell mottled with memories of forests that no longer existed. [40] Thunder rolled across the horizon—monsoons that would never arrive, courtesy of her atmospheric manipulation satellites. [55]

Vera had engineered this drought with surgical precision, starving three rivers until their beds cracked into a perfect map. [74] The pattern of fissures, viewed from her drone feeds, revealed the migration routes of seventeen extinct bird species, etched by nature's own desperation into dying earth. [101] Each crack corresponded to a flight path recorded nowhere else, preserved only in the land's traumatic memory. [118]

She knelt where three major fractures intersected, the convergence point her algorithms had predicted. [133] Here, beneath tons of salt deposited by her manufactured catastrophe, lay the acoustic fossil beds—layers of sediment that had captured and preserved the final songs of vanishing species. [163] The indigenous people who'd lived here had fled months ago, bought out by her shell companies with enough money to rebuild elsewhere. [185] Their departure was necessary; sentiment was a luxury she couldn't afford publicly. [197]

The case clicked open, revealing the egg nestled in bio-foam. [208] She'd purchased it from a black-market collector whose grandmother had stolen it from the Smithsonian before the second collapse. [227] Officially, Vera had destroyed it, adding another tax write-off to her humanitarian foundation's ledger. [242] But here, alone with approaching thunder that would never bring rain, she allowed herself this single act of preservation. [261]

Her fingers trembled as she placed the egg into the salt. [273] The crystals would preserve it better than any museum, the mineral matrix creating a natural time capsule. [290] More importantly, the acoustic properties of the salt flat would amplify the egg's calcium carbonate resonance, creating an eternal echo of what might have been—an unborn song crystallized in mineral and silence. [325]

The thunder grew closer, and Vera smiled bitterly. [333] Her weather modification would redirect the storm northward, where her agribusiness investments needed water. [347] The profit would fund more conservation efforts, more land purchases, more controlled disasters that saved what fragments remained of the natural world. [370] She was building an archive of absences, each extinct species preserved in the scars she carved into the earth. [390]

A crack appeared in the egg's surface—not damage, but part of her plan. [404] She'd weakened it precisely, allowing salt to penetrate and fossilize the albumin inside. [418] In decades, perhaps centuries, someone would find it and understand: here was proof that even monsters could mourn. [437]

She pulled out her tablet, updating the encrypted map she'd never share. [450] Each site marked another secret burial, another species given a monument visible only from space, readable only in drought. [470] The Carolina parakeet would join the passenger pigeon she'd interred beneath the Mojave, the golden toad under Death Valley's lowest point. [493]

Standing, Vera sealed the site with industrial salt pellets that would fuse in tomorrow's engineered heat wave. [511] The egg would sink deeper, safely entombed. [518] She thought of her public persona—the billionaire who destroyed ecosystems to save economies, who traded watersheds for profit margins. [538] They'd never understand that every devastation was calculated preservation, every drought a desperate museum. [553]

The thunder faded as her satellites activated, pulling moisture away. [563] She walked back across the salt, leaving no footprints that tomorrow's winds wouldn't erase. [577] Behind her, the egg began its slow transformation into stone, its silence joining the chorus of extinctions she orchestrated and preserved. [598]

In her helicopter, rising above the white expanse, Vera allowed herself one glance back. [613] The cracks in the earth spelled out songs in a language only the dead could read, and she was their sole, terrible translator. [636] She clutched the empty case, knowing she'd release a dozen more eggs before year's end, each burial funded by another manufactured disaster. [660] The thunder was gone now, diverted to water her cornfields, but its echo lingered in the salt—a promise that some things, however fractured, could still be saved. [689]

Even if salvation looked exactly like destruction. [696]

Even if grace came broken, piece by hoarded piece. [706]
