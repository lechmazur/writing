The ferry guides knew every soul arrived differently at the veiled ridgeway, that limestone spine where mist clung like unspoken prayers. [19] They waited with their oars crossed, watching the path that wound up from the valley where ordinary life ended and something else began. [40]

Marina had been running when her dog's leash snapped, the leather finally giving way after years of faithful service. [58] She'd chased him through brambles and over stone walls, calling his name until her voice went hoarse, following pawprints that led her through indirect routes she'd never noticed before. [87] The trail had brought her here at twilight, to this dock carved into the hillside where two figures stood beside a narrow boat. [110]

"We've been expecting someone," the first guide said, her voice carrying the same gently persistent rhythm as waves against shingle. [129] She held a brass ticket punch that caught the dying light, its business end shaped like a five-pointed star. [148]

"I'm looking for my dog," Marina said, though even as the words left her mouth, she understood she sought something deeper. [169]

The second guide, an old man whose beard moved like kelp in unfelt currents, gestured toward the water that had somehow appeared where none should exist, pooling between the ridges. [199] "What you seek lies across, but the crossing requires something of you." [211]

Marina touched her pocket where she'd kept treats, found instead a blank slip of paper she didn't remember carrying. [228] The woman with the star punch nodded, that gently persistent way the ferry guides had of acknowledging what passengers didn't yet understand themselves. [250]

"Your vigil begins now," the bearded guide said, settling into the boat's stern. [263] "We traverse these waters only at twilight, when courage sleeps in its unused corners, waiting to be found." [281]

The boat moved without their rowing, following channels between the limestone teeth that jutted from dark water. [297] Marina's ticket remained blank in her lap while overhead, the first stars began their own vigil, watching as they always watched this particular crossing. [322]

"I was never brave enough to let him run free," Marina confessed to the purple sky. [338] "Always held that leash tight, afraid he'd disappear." [346]

The woman guide touched the brass punch to Marina's ticket, and where the star pierced through, light pooled like phosphorescence. [367] "Unused courage waits in the spaces we create when we stop gripping so hard," she said, her words carrying that shoreline lullaby quality, soothing and eternal. [395]

They passed under stone arches where evening birds called out coordinates to dreams, through narrows where the water whispered names of everyone who'd ever loved something enough to let it go. [427] The ferry guides sang softly, a working song that turned the oars they didn't need to use, their voices braiding together like mist and limestone, like trust and release. [456]

Marina saw him then, waiting on the far shore of the ridgeway's hidden lake. [470] Not her dog exactly, but the shape of every unleashed joy she'd ever denied herself, every adventure she'd postponed, every risk she'd deemed too costly. [496] He wagged his tail in that way that meant the walk wasn't over, just beginning. [512]

"The return journey," the bearded guide said as they touched the shore, "you make alone." [527] He pressed the star-punched ticket into her palm. [535] "But you carry proof of passage." [541]

Marina stepped onto the shore that was somehow also the place where she'd started, the veiled ridgeway now revealing itself as every threshold she'd stood before, afraid to cross. [571] The ferry guides were already fading back into their twilight vigil, patient as limestone, gentle as lapping water. [589]

She looked at her hand where the leash should have been, found instead fingers that knew how to open, a heart punched through with star-shaped spaces where light could finally enter. [620] The dog that was and wasn't hers bounded ahead, showing her the indirect routes home, the ones that passed through courage she'd kept unused for far too long. [649]

Behind her, the ferry guides resumed their waiting, knowing another soul would arrive soon at this ridgeway between holding on and letting go, needing passage across the twilight water where all vigils eventually find their morning. [686]

Marina followed the star-shaped light leaking through her ticket, traversing the path back, no longer needing any leash at all. [708]
