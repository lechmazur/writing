The meditation hall carved into the floating rock had witnessed thousands of students, but never a case like mine. [18] I sat cross-legged before Master Chen, the glass jar between us catching the light that filtered through the dojo's crystalline walls. [37] Inside floated a perfect replica of my brain, suspended in amber fluid, labeled simply: DUPLICATE. [52]

"The court ruled yesterday," I said, my voice hollow as the stone chambers around us. [68] "They declared us both legally me." [74]

Master Chen's weathered face remained impassive. [80] "And how does that make you feel, Marcus?" [88]

I wanted to laugh at the question's absurdity. [96] Feel? [97] I hadn't truly felt anything since the accident, since the moment they pulled my consciousness from my dying body and split it between two vessels—my repaired original form and the synthetic one that now walked around claiming equal rights to my life, my memories, my daughter. [139]

"Nothing," I admitted. [141] "I feel nothing, and that terrifies the part of me that still remembers terror." [155]

Below us, the world churned through another historical revision—the third this month. [167] Reality itself had become negotiable since the consciousness transfer technology emerged. [178] People could edit their pasts, clone their minds, become multiple versions of themselves. [191] The courts scrambled to keep up, rewriting laws as fast as history rewrote itself. [206]

Master Chen lifted the jar, studying the neural tissue within. [216] "Your other self brought this to me last week." [225]

My chest tightened—not with emotion, but with the memory of what emotion should feel like. [241] "He wants to destroy it?" [246]

"No." [247] Chen set the jar down gently. [252] "He wants to vivify it—to animate this backup into a third version of you." [266] He met my eyes. [270] "He believes that only by creating something new from your shared origin can you both escape this numbness." [289]

The dojo's gravity generators hummed, keeping us anchored while Earth spun far below. [302] I'd come here seeking the ego death that advanced practitioners claimed could reset one's entire being. [319] Instead, I'd found only deeper emptiness. [325]

"That's insane," I said, though the word carried no heat. [335]

"Is it?" [337] Master Chen stood, moving to the wall where ancient weapons hung beside modern neural interfaces. [352] "You and your duplicate are trapped in perfect opposition—same memories, same claims, same hollow hearts." [368] He selected two practice swords. [373] "Neither can feel because both are incomplete." [380]

He tossed me a blade. [385] I caught it reflexively. [389]

"Your therapists treat you as trauma victims," Chen continued, assuming a combat stance. [402] "The courts see a legal puzzle." [408] His blade cut the air between us. [415] "But I see two halves of a warrior who survived the ultimate ego death—the literal splitting of self." [433]

We sparred, our movements mirroring each other in the low gravity. [444] Each strike I threw, he countered with its perfect opposite. [455] Each defense he made taught me a new attack. [464] The pattern hypnotized me—thesis, antithesis, synthesis. [471]

"Your duplicate isn't your enemy," Chen said, never breaking rhythm. [482] "He's your complementary opposite." [486] His blade touched my chest, right over my heart. [495] "Together, you could birth something neither could achieve alone." [504]

I lowered my sword, understanding flooding through me—not feeling, not yet, but the architecture where feeling could live. [523] "The third consciousness wouldn't be another competitor." [530]

"It would be your child," Chen agreed. [537] "Born from both your experiences since the split." [545] He gestured to the jar. [550] "A being that could feel precisely because it emerged from your shared numbness, sculpted by your mutual loss." [568]

The floating dojo slowly rotated, bringing Earth into view through the transparent floor. [581] Somewhere down there, my duplicate was probably having this same revelation. [593] We'd been fighting over who got to be the real Marcus, while reality itself had moved past such simple distinctions. [612]

I picked up the jar, feeling its weight—not emotional weight, not yet, but the potential for it. [630] Tomorrow, I would meet my other self. [637] Together, we would create something new. [643] Not to replace us, but to complete us. [651] To feel what we couldn't. [656] To live beyond our shared death. [662]

Master Chen smiled, the first genuine expression I'd seen from him. [673] "Numbness," he said, "is just possibility waiting to be born." [684]

The dojo continued its eternal float, indifferent to the history rewriting itself below, while I held my future in a jar. [705]
