The lantern maker's fingers trembled as she polished the dream-gem, its surface catching memories of her daughter's laughter before the shadow detached itself that terrible morning. [24] Mei had crafted thousands of lanterns in her workshop beneath the glass basilica, but none could illuminate the darkness that had swallowed little Lin whole when the shadow-plague swept through the floating isle. [56]

Now, three months later, Mei worked in the tea garden suspended between heaven and earth, where mourning parents came to transform their grief into something bearable. [81] The garden floated serenely above clouds that concealed the world below, its pavilions connected by bridges of woven moonlight. [99] Here, Master Shen taught the ancient art of dream recording—capturing memories in crystallized form before sorrow could corrupt them. [118]

"Your pain descends while ascending," Master Shen had explained on Mei's first day, his weathered hands demonstrating the peculiar motion of gem polishing. [141] "Down into the stone, up into light." [149] The technique required grinding away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love toward the surface. [168]

Mei's crafty nature, honed through years of bending glass and wire into impossible shapes, served her well in this delicate work. [190] Each recorded dream became a luminous torment—beautiful to behold yet agonizing to create. [203] She captured Lin's first steps across their workshop floor, her tiny hands reaching for the colored glass that threw rainbows on the walls. [227] She preserved the sound of Lin singing to the lanterns, believing they were lonely in the dark. [245]

The glass basilica loomed above the garden, its transparent walls revealing the workshop where Mei had once taught Lin to fold paper cranes. [269] "One thousand brings a wish," Lin had said, her voice bright as the lanterns they made together. [287] Now Mei understood differently—she wasn't folding paper but grief itself, each recorded dream another crane in her count toward acceptance. [309]

As weeks passed, Mei's collection grew. [316] She polished dreams of bedtime stories into amber spheres, ground memories of shared meals into jade discs. [333] The shadow that had taken Lin could not touch these crystallized moments; they existed outside time's reach, perfect and untouchable. [354]

Other parents worked nearby, their own gems catching light in ways that spoke of different losses, different loves. [373] The tea garden's floating paths wound between their stations, creating a constellation of sorrow transformed into something almost bearable. [393] The basilica's bells rang at sunset, their crystal notes carrying across the isle, calling the grieving to rest. [412]

One evening, Mei discovered something unexpected in her latest dream-gem. [423] As she polished away another layer, she found not memory but possibility—Lin as she might have been, older, teaching her own daughter to make lanterns. [449] The vision shimmered with potential futures that would never unfold, yet somehow, seeing them brought not deeper pain but a strange peace. [472]

"The shadow detaches," Master Shen observed, watching Mei work, "but so too does attachment to one form of love." [492] He gestured to her growing collection of dream-gems. [501] "You transform grief not by destroying it, but by giving it new shape." [515]

Mei understood then why she had been drawn to this floating sanctuary. [528] Her craftiness with lanterns had always been about capturing light, holding it in forms that could guide others through darkness. [549] Now she captured something more precious—the luminous torment of love that persists beyond loss. [564]

She began incorporating the dream-gems into new lanterns, each one a shrine to memory that could never be extinguished. [584] When hung in the basilica, they cast shadows that danced like living things, like daughters who once were, ascending even as they descended into memory. [610] The other parents wept to see them, recognizing their own losses reflected in the dancing light, finding in Mei's creation a way to hold both sorrow and joy without choosing between them. [642]

As she polished the final gem in her thousandth crane of grief, Mei felt Lin's presence not as absence but as transformation—love reformed into light that would guide others through their own shadow-touched journeys. [678] The floating island's tea garden bloomed around her, eternal spring nourished by tears transformed into something that could sustain rather than drown. [700] Her lanterns hung throughout the glass basilica now, each one proof that even the craftiest hands cannot rebuild what is lost, only transform it into something that helps the living continue their ascending descent toward peace.
