The oath scribe Matthias pressed his ear against the cold stone of the rooftop garden, listening for the harbor's foghorn that had guided ships through the strait for ninety years. [29] Nothing. [30] Its silence meant the old world was finally gone. [37]

He stood slowly, joints protesting after decades of transcribing vows in languages that no longer had native speakers—Akkadian marriage oaths, Etruscan business contracts, Gothic blood promises. [62] The apple trees around him, transplanted from a monastery destroyed in the wars, grew in neat rows forty stories above the drowned streets. [85] Their roots gripped engineered soil while their branches reached toward a sky that hadn't been blue in his lifetime. [103]

From his satchel, Matthias withdrew the wax cylinder phonograph shaving, no bigger than his thumb. [118] He'd discovered it yesterday while cataloging the museum's final acquisitions before the waters rose higher. [133] The shaving had fallen from a damaged Edison cylinder, and when he'd held it to the light, he'd seen the groove patterns that encoded someone's voice from 1889. [162]

The patterns triggered something deep—a memory from third grade, Mrs. Chen taking their class to the Natural History Museum. [181] He remembered pressing his small hands against the display case containing a phonograph, feeling the vibrations of a recording playing inside, and suddenly understanding that sound was just patterns, that voices were mathematics carved in wax. [218] That day, little Matthias had turned to his teacher and said, "Everything that will be spoken already exists in the possible patterns." [239] She'd laughed, ruffled his hair. [244] But he'd been right. [248]

Now, in this garden above the ruins, Matthias understood his true work. [260] Not just preserving dead languages, but archiving the emotional patterns within them—the specific tremor of a Sumerian mother's lullaby, the cadence of a Phoenician merchant's haggling, the rhythm of a Gaulish warrior's death song. [295] Each language carried unique patterns for encoding human feeling. [304] When they died, entire spectrums of emotion became inexpressible. [313]

He immersed the wax shaving in the basin of restoration fluid he'd carried up the morning the foghorn first began to weaken. [335] The solution, his own invention, could recover impressions from damaged recording media. [347] As the wax softened, releasing its frozen voice, Matthias heard something impossible—Old Church Slavonic, spoken with an accent that hadn't existed for three centuries. [371] But the words themselves were English, modern English, describing events that wouldn't happen for another six hours: "The northern tower will crack at sunset. [395] The garden will survive. [399] Someone will find this." [403]

His hands trembled. [406] The phonograph had been manufactured in 1889. [413] The language dated to the ninth century. [420] The message described tonight. [424]

Matthias understood then what he'd stumbled upon—not a recording but a pattern that had always existed in the possible configurations of wax and groove, waiting for the exact moment when someone who spoke dead languages would discover it in a garden built atop humanity's tomb. [467] Time wasn't linear in the space between languages. [475] The third-grade boy who'd intuited this truth had been responding to this very moment, decades before it arrived. [493]

As predicted, at sunset the northern tower cracked with a sound like breaking teeth. [507] Matthias spent the night transcribing the rest of the shaving's prophecy in seventeen dead languages, creating a rosetta stone of emotional patterns that would teach future survivors not just words but the feelings those words once carried. [544] The apple trees rustled in wind that smelled of salt and endings. [557]

By dawn, he'd finished. [561] The manuscript would be found, as the voice had promised, by someone who would understand that prophecy wasn't about predicting the future but about preserving the patterns that let humans feel backward through time, accessing the emotions of the dead through the mathematics of their speech. [601]

Matthias placed the restored shaving in a glass case at the garden's heart, where it would wait to be discovered again. [623] Below, the waters continued rising, swallowing the last echoes of the foghorn's century of warnings. [639] Above, the apples grew ripe with knowledge that transcended time, their sweetness a kind of vocabulary for hope. [657] The oath scribe sat among them, speaking comfort to the trees in languages only they remembered, his work finally complete. [678]
