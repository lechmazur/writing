The Keeper drifted through the nebula garden, her translucent form catching starlight like dew on spider silk. [16] For seven billion years, she had tended these cosmic blooms—clouds of hydrogen and helium that burst into stellar flowers every few millennia. [35] Each generation of stars followed the same pattern: birth, brilliance, decay, and finally, the quiet sigh of falling petals as their outer layers dispersed into space. [60]

She paused at a dying red giant, its crimson light pulsing with the rhythm of a tired heart. [78] From within her ethereal body, she withdrew the calculating machine gear—an artifact older than most galaxies, its teeth worn smooth by eons of computation. [103] The gear had once belonged to a civilization that sought to model eternity itself, approximating infinity through endless mechanical iterations. [123] They had failed, of course, but their tool remained, passed down through countless custodians until it reached her. [142]

The Keeper pressed the gear against the star's photosphere and felt it begin to turn. [157] Click-click-click-click—each rotation measured the star's remaining heartbeats, predicting the moment of its final exhale. [173] Three thousand years, perhaps four. [178] A blink to her, but time enough for the pattern to complete. [190]

She initiated her transit to the next cluster, moving not through space but between its folds. [206] As she traveled, she sent out sonar pings—not of sound, which cannot traverse vacuum, but of gravitational ripples that mapped the garden's hidden geometries. [232] Each ping returned with data: here, a protostar nursing on its natal cloud; there, a white dwarf cooling toward darkness. [253] The patterns repeated endlessly, yet each iteration carried subtle variations, like a song hummed by different voices across generations. [273]

The troubling serenity of it all had begun to weigh on her. [285] She was the only one of her kind left to witness these cycles, the last otherworldly sentimentalist who mourned each star's passing while celebrating its offspring. [310] Her species had long ago transcended physical needs, but she remained, driven by a singular purpose: to share light without using fire. [333]

It was a paradox that defined her existence. [341] Fire consumed, destroyed, transformed matter into energy with violent hunger. [351] But starlight—pure photons born from fusion—that was different. [360] It gave without taking, illuminated without burning. [367] She had learned to harvest this light during stellar death throes, collecting it in quantum bottles that preserved both its warmth and its memory. [391]

The sonar pings revealed her destination: a stellar nursery where young protostars were just beginning to ignite. [408] She arrived as the first one achieved fusion, its newborn light cutting through the nebular haze. [425] The Keeper extended herself around it, not to possess but to remember. [437] This star would live for ten billion years, would nurture planets, might even foster life. [453] But eventually, it too would fade, its petals falling in the same ancient pattern. [468]

She took out the calculating machine gear again, holding it up to catch the virgin starlight. [485] The gear spun freely now, no longer grinding through calculations but simply turning, turning, turning—a meditation on infinity that could never quite reach its destination. [511] Each rotation caught and released photons, sharing them with the darkness without diminishing their source. [527]

Around her, the nebula garden stretched beyond comprehension, each cloud a womb for future generations of stars. [545] She would tend them all, these children of gravity and time, watching them bloom and fade across eons. [563] The pattern would continue, approximating infinity through repetition, each cycle a verse in an endless poem. [579]

The Keeper smiled—an expression more felt than seen in her ethereal form. [591] The troubling serenity remained, but she had made peace with it. [602] To be the sole witness to such beauty was both burden and privilege. [615] She would continue her transit through the garden, pinging the darkness, sharing the light of dying stars with the void that waited to embrace them. [641] And when the last star finally dimmed, she would remember them all—every generation, every pattern, every quiet sigh of falling petals that had marked the passage of infinity through time.
