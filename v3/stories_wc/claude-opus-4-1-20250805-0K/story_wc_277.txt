The rosewood pen nib gleamed between Margot Blackwood's fingers as she stood in the echoing observatory, its copper dome floating above evening clouds like a ship unmoored from earth. [28] Three generations of newsprint fortune had built this sanctuary where her grandfather once tracked celestial bodies, but tonight Margot tracked something far more elusive—the truth behind tomorrow's headline. [55]

The journalist had called twenty minutes ago. [62] "Your father's memoir contradicts itself," he'd said, voice crackling through the observatory's ancient intercom. [75] "Page 47 claims he was in Geneva during the Whitmore scandal. [87] Page 289 puts him at the board meeting that destroyed them." [99] The line had gone dead before she could respond. [108]

Margot pressed the antique nib to paper, her devotedly observant nature catching how its shadow traced perfect ellipses as her hand trembled—orbits of regret, she thought, watching the loops form and reform. [139] Her father had taught her that truth moved like planets: predictable paths that occasionally revealed themselves to be something else entirely when viewed from the proper angle. [164]

She began to write, not the denial her lawyers would prefer, but a proof. [178] If her father had been in Geneva, then the photograph from the board meeting was fabricated. [194] But she had seen that photograph herself, had held the original in the archive room, had noticed the peculiar way light caught his wedding ring. [219] Therefore, he hadn't been in Geneva. [225] The memoir lied about that. [230]

But wait—she paused, nib hovering. [235] The Geneva alibi had been corroborated by the Swiss ambassador's diary, published posthumously last year. [249] Unless the ambassador had lied too, which meant... [257] Her pen moved faster now, chasing the contradiction like a comet's tail. [269]

The observatory's brass instruments hummed around her, their measurements eternal and precise, mocking the slippery nature of human truth. [288] Through the great lens above, stars emerged as clouds parted, each one broadcasting light from different moments in time, all arriving now, simultaneously. [311]

That was when she understood. [316]

Both accounts were true. [320] The board meeting had been held via telegram while her father sat in a Geneva hotel, orchestrating the Whitmore destruction remotely through encrypted messages. [343] The "presence" at the meeting had been his words, read aloud by a trusted proxy—the same proxy who'd later died in that convenient automobile accident. [368]

She could expose this now, could intervene before tomorrow's headlines canonized her father's sanitized version. [383] The rosewood nib seemed to pulse with possibility. [391] But revelation would destroy more than his reputation; it would unravel thirty years of carefully negotiated truces, dissolved lawsuits, buried scandals. [413] The Blackwood newspaper empire existed because certain truths remained orbital, circling but never landing. [427]

Margot laughed—a sound both mournful and amused that echoed through the dome's acoustic perfection. [441] How fitting that she'd solved this puzzle here, where her grandfather had discovered a new asteroid but never reported it, fearing the attention would bring scrutiny to his wartime activities. [467] The men in her family had always understood that some discoveries were best kept floating in the dark. [485]

She began writing again, but differently now. [492] Not the truth that would satisfy the journalist's hunger, nor the lie that would preserve her father's fiction. [509] Instead, she crafted something else: a third story that contradicted both versions so completely, so absurdly, that it would render the entire question moot. [533] She would claim her father had been in Tokyo that week, negotiating with publishers who could verify he'd never stepped foot in Japan. [556]

The journalist would chase this new impossibility, would exhaust himself trying to reconcile three mutually exclusive narratives. [572] By the time he realized the Tokyo story was deliberate misdirection, the news cycle would have spun past, carrying its attention elsewhere. [594]

The rosewood nib scratched its final period as dawn approached, clouds below beginning to glow like old newsprint held to flame. [615] Margot had intervened not by revealing truth but by making truth impossible to determine. [629] She sealed the letter with wax, pressed her family's seal deep—a telescope crossed with a printing press. [646]

Some orbits, she'd learned, were designed never to complete. [655] Some regrets were meant to circle forever, keeping their distance from the gravity of consequence. [670] Tomorrow the headlines would scream about Tokyo, and the real story would remain here, echoing in the observatory above the clouds, where only the stars could witness what the last newsprint heiress truly knew. [704]

She touched the rosewood nib to her lips—a goodbye kiss to honesty—then locked it in the observatory's vault. [723] Let the next generation decide whether to complete the orbit or let it decay into darkness. [740] For now, she had a newspaper empire to protect and a father's ghost to keep dancing between contradictions. [758] The morning edition waited for no one, not even the truth. [770]
