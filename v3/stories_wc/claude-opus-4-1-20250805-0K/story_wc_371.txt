The bread appeared every Tuesday morning, wrapped in the same waxed paper that Moretti's Bakery had used before the fire claimed it seven years ago. [23] Lila found it tucked beneath the jasmine vines she'd planted illegally along the palace wall, still warm, smelling of rosemary and time. [44]

She was the only one who noticed these gentle intrusions of the impossible. [57] While others hurried past the abandoned palace grounds, she observed how reality bent in small, merciful ways—a fountain that ran despite having no source, moths that wrote messages in their flight patterns, shadows that fell upward on certain afternoons. [95]

The bread was her compass. [100] Each loaf led her deeper into the overgrown courtyard, past her secret gardens of midnight lettuce and moon radishes she'd planted without permission, following a trail only she could perceive. [128] Today, it guided her through a gap in the thornrose hedge she'd cultivated to hide the entrance. [145]

Behind the vegetation stood a door she'd never seen before. [155]

Inside, candles illuminated a tea house that shouldn't exist, its paper screens painted with scenes of birds flying south, though autumn had long since passed. [179] An elderly woman sat at a low table, pouring tea into cups that materialized as needed. [195]

"You're the gardener," the woman said, not asking. [203] "The one who plants truth in abandoned spaces." [211]

Lila set the bread on the table. [218] It uncloaked itself slowly, revealing not dough but densely woven memories—the baker's last morning, his hands shaping loaves as smoke crept under his door, his final act of creation an anchor thrown forward through time. [254]

"He was my grandfather," the woman explained. [261] "This tea house exists because you noticed. [268] Your gardens gave it permission to grow." [275]

Through the paper screens, Lila could see her guerrilla plantings spreading like benevolent secrets—tomatoes climbing the palace walls, squash hiding beneath forgotten statuary, herbs transforming decay into abundance. [303] Each unauthorized seed had been an act of faith that someone, somewhere, needed beauty to persist. [319]

"The sacred hides in ordinary things," the woman continued, breaking the bread. [331] "But only those who pay attention can grant it absolution." [342]

Lila understood then that her strange gift—this cursed awareness of reality's soft edges—was not madness but ministry. [359] Every anomaly she'd catalogued, every impossible thing she'd accepted without fear, had been building toward this moment of recognition. [378]

The woman poured tea that tasted of future rain. [387] "My grandfather's spirit needed someone to witness his bread, to know that love persists even after the ovens cool. [406] Your attention freed him." [410]

Outside, Lila heard the ghost-echo of birds returning too early, or perhaps too late, their wings writing stories about seasons that bent backward on themselves. [436] The palace courtyard had become a sanctuary for lost things seeking form. [448]

"Will the tea house remain?" [453] Lila asked. [455]

"As long as someone tends the gardens that hide it." [466] The woman smiled with her grandfather's eyes. [473] "As long as someone remembers that bread can outlive its bakery, that absence is just presence wearing disguise." [491]

Lila left carrying seeds the woman pressed into her palm—varieties that didn't exist yet, wouldn't exist unless planted by someone who understood that reality was negotiable, that the universe practiced a heuristic kindness toward those who noticed its experiments. [534]

She would return tomorrow to plant them. [541] She would water them with collected rain and conversations with the moths. [552] She would create more hidden gardens throughout the city, each one a doorway for the displaced sacred to find its way home. [573]

The bread would continue appearing, she knew, until every crumb of her grandfather's love had been received. [590] And Lila would continue finding it, this woman who saw the world's quiet amendments to itself, who understood that some absolutions could only be granted by those willing to witness the impossible without demanding explanation. [626]

In the abandoned palace courtyard, where she'd first learned to plant seeds in secret, the tea house flickered between being and not-being, waiting for someone else to need what only the attentive could see. [661]

The bread, when she unwrapped it that night, tasted of forgiveness and time. [674]
