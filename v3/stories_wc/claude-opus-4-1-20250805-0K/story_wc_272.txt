Marina's fingers trembled as she traced the splintered edges of the tarot card box, its lacquered surface cracked like a mirror that had seen too many futures. [24] The forgotten library spiraled above her, books breathing dust in the lighthouse's salt-stained belly while waves crashed against rocks far below. [44] 

"What good is prophecy when you can't even paint what's real anymore?" [57] She whispered to the shadows, though they never answered her rhetorical questions—they simply multiplied, fractured, split like her subjects' faces had begun to do six months ago. [83] 

The walls seemed closer today. [88] Not metaphorically—actually, physically closer, as if the lighthouse itself was collapsing inward, reality folding like badly mixed watercolors bleeding into each other. [108] Marina had climbed here seeking answers in the abandoned fortune-teller's collection, but found only this broken box and cards that showed different images depending on the angle of viewing. [138]

"How can I paint portraits when everyone has three faces now?" [150] The question echoed up the spiral staircase, and somewhere high above, a window shattered inward rather than out. [168] Glass fell upward, tinkling like chimes. [174]

She'd been commissioned to paint the mayor's daughter last spring, back when faces still held together. [190] But halfway through the sitting, the girl's features had begun to drift—one eye sliding toward her temple, her smile stretching into tomorrow while her frown lingered in yesterday. [218] Marina had tried to capture it all, creating a cubist nightmare that made the family weep. [235] Word spread. [237] No one wanted portraits anymore from the artist who painted people falling apart. [250]

The tarot cards spilled from the broken box, each one showing scenes that shouldn't exist together: The Tower growing roots while The Hanged Man walked upright through its door. [280] Marina understood now—she needed to redesign her entire approach to seeing. [292] Not paint what was there, but untangle the threads of what was trying to be. [307]

"Why do we assume reality should hold still for us?" [318] She asked the lighthouse walls, which groaned in response, pressing closer. [329] The books on the shelves began to blur, their pages fluttering open to reveal text written in languages that changed mid-sentence. [351] 

Marina picked up The Moon card, watching as its silver surface showed her own reflection split into past and future selves—the celebrated portraitist she'd been, the frightened woman she was, and something else, something darker but necessary. [390] To paint the truth now meant descending into that darkness where fragments made sense, where broken things revealed their hidden wholeness. [411]

She began sketching on the back of the scattered cards, using charcoal from the lighthouse's long-dead beacon fire. [429] Each stroke untangled another thread of the collapsed reality around her—the walls weren't closing in, they were opening inward, revealing layers of the lighthouse that existed in parallel times. [460] The broken tarot box wasn't damaged; it was showing all its possible states simultaneously. [475]

"What if our eyes were always the limitation?" [484] Marina laughed, though it came out cracked and luminous with grief for her old way of seeing. [501] She was redesigning herself by untangling what she thought she knew about dimension, about sequence, about the proper order of things. [523]

The portrait emerged across multiple cards: herself, but honestly fragmented, each piece containing its own complete truth. [541] Her crestfallen months showed in the shadow of her jaw, while hope flickered in the corner of her eye that looked toward tomorrow. [565] The walls pressed close enough to touch now, but she understood—they were embracing, not crushing. [580] 

As the last thread untangled, Marina saw clearly: every broken thing was whole in its own dimension. [598] She would paint portraits again, but now she'd capture people as they truly were—magnificently, necessarily shattered, glowing with the ache of existing in multiple possibilities at once. [627] The lighthouse beam, dead for decades, suddenly blazed to life above her, casting shadows in impossible directions. [645]

"Who says darkness isn't another kind of light?" [654] She asked, and this time, the universe answered by showing her everything at once. [668]
