The lighthouse prison had no name, only a number etched into brass plates that the salt air had turned green. [19] Perched on Devil's Tooth Reef, it housed those whose lies had killed. [32] In the highest cell, behind a door left ajar for thirty years—its paint scuffed by desperate fingernails—lived Marcus, son of the boy who cried wolf. [58]

His father's final lie had brought real wolves to Hamelin. [68] Twenty-three children dead before dawn. [73] The magistrate ruled it murder by deception, and his father died in this same cell, leaving Marcus born behind bars, inheriting both imprisonment and curse. [98]

Marcus could hover. [101] Not fly—hover, three inches above any surface, sustained by the impossibility of his existence. [115] A child conceived in a lighthouse prison shouldn't exist, yet here he was, defying gravity as casually as logic. [134]

Through the scuffs on the narrow door, Marcus watched copper light from the setting sun paint the confession booth's lattice. [155] The prison chaplain had died years ago, but his confessional remained, its intricate wooden screen salvaged from a shipwreck, installed as a cruel joke. [179] Prisoners could confess to no one. [185]

Tonight was different. [187] Marcus had discovered something in his father's journals, hidden beneath loose stones. [199] The wolves hadn't been random. [204] They'd been summoned by someone else, someone who needed a scapegoat for darker crimes. [219] Twenty-three children hadn't died from wolves. [226] They'd been dead already. [230]

Marcus pressed against the door. [235] After decades of salt and neglect, it creaked open another inch. [247] He could hover through now, threading his way into the corridor like smoke through a keyhole. [264] The confession booth stood at the corridor's end, its lattice casting maze-like shadows. [278]

He was chasing hush—that perfect silence before truth emerges. [288] His father had written about it obsessively. [295] "Truth lives in the spaces between heartbeats," the journal said. [306] "In the pause before confession." [311]

Marcus hovered through the corridor, his bare feet never touching the stone. [323] The copper light grew deeper, richer. [329] Soon, the supply boat would arrive for its monthly visit. [339] Before they found the bodies he'd discovered in the lighthouse's sealed basement—children's bones wrapped in wolf pelts, far older than his father's supposed crime—Marcus needed to thread this labyrinth with his own story. [377]

The lattice seemed to pulse. [382] Marcus understood now why it sustained impossibilities. [389] Every confession ever whispered through its wooden maze still lived there, creating a map of truths. [405] He pressed his palm against it. [411]

Images flooded through: the real killer, the prison's first warden, collecting children for rituals. [426] His father arriving in the village, a convenient stranger. [435] The warden releasing wolves from cages, then hanging himself in this very lighthouse as authorities closed in. [453] His father's desperate, unbelieved truth, twisted into the boy who cried wolf's legacy. [467]

Marcus began to speak through the lattice, his voice finding the cadence of confession. [481] But this wasn't confession—it was testimony. [487] Each word hover-carved itself into the wood, becoming part of the labyrinth's pattern. [501] The copper light held everything in amber repose, peaceful despite the horrors being revealed. [515]

"My name is Marcus True-Tongue," he said, reclaiming what had been stolen. [527] "Son of Thomas Truth-Teller, who died for refusing to confess to lies." [539] The lattice glowed, accepting this thread into its maze. [548]

By morning, when the supply boat arrived, they would find Marcus hovering in the confessional, the lattice transformed into a testament. [569] Every scuff on the door, every scratch in wood, would spell out the real story. [585] The bodies below would be discovered, evidence finally aligning with truth. [596]

Marcus smiled, floating in copper light, having threaded the labyrinth at last. [608] The hush he'd chased was his own heartbeat, steady between truths. [619] The lighthouse prison had been built to contain liars. [628] Tonight, it would finally hold the truth. [635]
