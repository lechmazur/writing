The opal dock stretched into fog like a severed finger, its weathered planks gleaming with trapped moonstone colors beneath the mist. [19] Nautical twilight had arrived—that precise moment when the sun dips twelve degrees below the horizon, when navigators lose the sea's edge but can still discern the brightest stars. [48] 

Magnus Whitmore descended from his lighthouse, carrying the dried Edelweiss boutonniere in his salt-cracked palm. [63] Three days ago, a stranger had pressed it into his hand before stepping backward off this very dock, vanishing into the churning gray waters without explanation. [89] The Alpine flower, preserved and ancient, felt wrong here at sea's edge—a mountain bloom exiled to tidal pools. [107]

Magnus had worn other people's memories before. [114] It was his peculiar gift, or curse: touching certain objects let him slip into their owners' recollections like trying on wet clothes. [136] But this boutonniere resisted him with softly persistent silence, offering only gaps where memories should bloom. [152]

He walked the dock's length, investigating those gaps the way a dentist probes for cavities. [167] The flower had been worn at a wedding—he sensed that much—but whose? [179] The brass pin still held threads of navy wool, suggesting a formal jacket. [192] When Magnus pressed the brittle petals to his temple, he caught fragments: organ music bleeding into ocean wind, rice becoming sea foam, a bride's face that flickered between joy and terror. [224]

The lighthouse beam swept across the water, and in its passing, Magnus noticed something. [238] The gaps in the boutonniere's memory aligned with the lighthouse's rotation—every fourth sweep, another absence. [252] He began timing them against his pulse, finding a pattern that felt deliberately carved rather than naturally worn. [270]

Someone had edited these memories. [275] Removed specific moments with surgical precision. [281]

Magnus returned to where the stranger had stood, studying the dock's opalescent surface. [294] In this light, at this exact angle, he could see scratches in the wood: coordinates, etched with fingernails in those final moments. [317] Not geographic coordinates—temporal ones. [321] Dates and times, arranged like sheet music. [328]

He understood then. [331] The stranger hadn't been giving him the boutonniere; he'd been returning it. [343] These weren't borrowed memories but stolen ones, taken from Magnus himself during a wedding he could no longer recall. [362] The gaps weren't missing pieces—they were the only parts left intact, preserved spaces where his own memories should rest. [382]

Magnus held the Edelweiss up to the lighthouse beam. [391] Through its dried transparency, he saw himself forty years younger, placing this same flower on his own lapel. [409] His bride, Elizabeth, adjusting it with nervous fingers. [417] The mountain chapel where they'd married, before he'd taken the lighthouse position, before she'd grown to hate the isolation, before she'd left him here with his solitary light. [446]

The stranger had been their son. [452] The son Elizabeth had taken, raised in mountains far from sea spray, taught to forget his father who spoke to shadows and wore the memories of drowned sailors. [477] But genetics are softly persistent things. [483] The boy had inherited Magnus's gift, had spent decades investigating his mother's careful omissions, observing the gaps in her stories about his father. [505]

At the dock's end, Magnus found what his son had left: a small pile of other objects, each one containing a borrowed memory of Magnus that Elizabeth had hidden away. [535] A compass from their honeymoon. [540] A fountain pen from love letters. [546] A pocket watch from the day she'd told him she was pregnant. [558]

The nautical twilight was ending. [563] True darkness approached, but Magnus felt lighter. [570] His son had returned these pieces not from kindness but from burden—unable to carry the weight of his father's stolen joy any longer. [593] The final gesture hadn't been suicide but baptism: washing himself clean of inherited memories in the same waters that had swallowed so many of Magnus's years. [619]

Magnus climbed back to his lighthouse, the Edelweiss pinned to his jacket once more. [633] He would keep his watch through the night, as always, but now he had his own memories to companion his witnessed isolation. [655] The gaps were filling themselves, softly persistent as rising tide. [665]

In the lighthouse beam's next rotation, he thought he saw a figure swimming toward shore—or perhaps it was just the way borrowed memories sometimes surface, desperate and gasping, when finally returned home. [698]
