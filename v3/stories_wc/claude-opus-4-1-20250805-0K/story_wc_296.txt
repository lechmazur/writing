The druid Kael stood at the edge of the cursed lake, watching apple trees spiral impossibly through the water's surface, their roots and branches forming a living vortex that defied nature's laws. [28] Three days had passed since his illusion failed before the war council, revealing not the false peace treaty he'd conjured, but something far worse—the frozen words of his ancestor's confession, crystallized in ice that wouldn't melt. [64]

The confession spoke of planting flesh-eating seeds throughout the realm's sacred groves, a betrayal that would consume the very forests the druids swore to protect. [88] Kael had always found lost things—coins in riverbanks, memories in old stones, truths in forgotten places—but this discovery threatened everything. [108] The war council had given him seven sunsets to prove his bloodline's innocence or face execution alongside his entire order. [128]

He dove into the lake's cursed waters with practiced calm, that warlike serenity his mentor had taught him—the mind of battle wedded to the heart of still water. [157] The orchard vortex pulled him down through layers of twisted reality, where apple blossoms bloomed and rotted simultaneously, where roots grew backward into sky that existed beneath water. [186]

At the vortex's heart lay what mirrors couldn't show: a garden of glass trees, each one reflecting not images but absences—the spaces between truth and deception. [213] Here, his ancestor had hidden the antidote to his treachery, knowing that only a descendant who could find lost things would ever reach this place. [238]

Kael moved in expanding circles through the garden, each revolution revealing another layer of the frozen confession. [255] His ancestor hadn't betrayed the druids at all—he'd accepted a terrible burden, pretending to plant the flesh-eating seeds while actually sowing their dormant cousins, harmless until activated by a specific incantation. [287] It was a deception within a deception, designed to fool an enemy that could read thoughts but not intentions buried beneath false guilt. [309]

The true flesh-eating seed rested at the garden's center, contained in a sphere of living amber. [326] Kael understood now—his ancestor had made himself a pariah to protect this single seed, the only one that could devour the Blight that even now crept toward their borders. [356] The war council saw only conquest and defense, but the real enemy grew in silence, spreading through root systems, invisible to those who trusted only their eyes. [383]

To unbend the twisted truth, Kael would need to shatter the frozen confession—not to hide it, but to release its full message. [406] He pressed the amber sphere against the ice, and both began to crack. [419] The confession's final words emerged: "Let my dishonor be my gift. [430] Plant this seed only when the Blight reveals itself, for it hungers only for corruption, and finding corruption is its purpose." [451]

The vortex began to slow as Kael rose through the water, the orchard trees straightening from their spiral, reaching skyward as nature intended. [474] He emerged from the lake carrying both seed and shattered confession, water streaming from his guarded expression. [491] The war council would demand proof, but proof lived in what mirrors couldn't show—the sacrifice of reputation for salvation, the willing acceptance of hatred to preserve what mattered. [518]

As he walked toward the council chambers, Kael felt the seed pulse with dormant hunger in his palm. [537] His ancestor had found the one thing that could save them and lost everything else to protect it. [555] Now Kael would plant it with the same warlike serenity, knowing that victory sometimes meant letting others believe you've lost. [575] The Blight would come, drawn by the very wars the council waged, and when it did, the flesh-eating seed would feast on corruption itself, cleansing the land through consumption. [605] He would be ready, guarded as his bloodline had always been, finding what was lost in the spaces between honor and necessity. [627] The frozen confession had thawed into liquid truth, and truth, like water, always found its way. [644]
