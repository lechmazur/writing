The performer sat at the farmhouse kitchen table, her expression as empty as winter sky. [15] Outside, the massive turbine blades carved through morning mist with their eternal whisper-roar, casting shifting shadows across yellowed wallpaper. [33]

"Now I select the knife," she announced to no one, her voice flat as pressed paper. [50] "The blade catches light from the window where turbines spin, spin, spin." [63] Her fingers wrapped around the handle with practiced precision. [72] "I lift the wood—basswood, soft, forgiving." [79]

She had arrived three months after the Happiness Mandate, when smiling became law and grief became contraband. [96] The farmhouse owner, Mrs. Chen, had found her performing in the underground theaters where blank-faced actors helped others process their illegal sorrows through peculiar rituals. [119]

"The knife enters the grain," she continued, each curl of wood falling like a secret. [135] "One stroke removes what isn't needed." [142] Another slice. [144] "Another stroke." [146] The pile grew. [149]

Mrs. Chen watched from the doorway, clutching the dried flower bouquet she'd kept since her daughter's funeral—before such displays were banned. [171] Lavender, baby's breath, roses turned brittle as old laws. [180] The performer had promised to help her achieve something the authorities called impossible: lightness without forgetting. [196]

"I am creating space within the wood," the performer narrated, her monotone somehow more honest than any mandated joy. [216] "Each cut is deliberate." [220] She never looked up. [224] "Each removal calculated." [227]

The method seemed absurd at first—this dramatic narration of ordinary tasks—but Mrs. Chen understood now. [242] In a world where authentic emotion was criminal, the performer had discovered a loophole. [256] By draining all feeling from her voice while describing simple actions, she created a remade hush, a silence that somehow held everything. [279]

"The wood becomes smaller," the performer continued whittling. [287] "More essential." [289] Her blank face reflected nothing, judged nothing. [296] "Soon it will be what it was always meant to become." [308]

Mrs. Chen stepped forward, extending the bouquet. [315] Without pausing her narration, the performer accepted it. [322] "I place the dried flowers beside my work," she said. [333] "They cast shadows shaped like memories." [339]

The turbines groaned overhead, their shadows playing across the table like dark clock hands. [353] The performer's moral ambiguity lived in this space—neither rebel nor conformist, neither healing nor harming. [368] She simply existed in the gap between what was required and what was real. [383]

"I continue to whittle," she said, and Mrs. Chen heard something shift in the emptiness. [399] "The wood grows lighter." [403] A pause. [405] "Not happier." [407] Another curl fell. [410] "Lighter." [411]

Mrs. Chen understood. [414] The performer wasn't teaching her to forget grief or fake joy. [426] She was showing her how to carry sorrow differently, how to hollow it out from inside until it could float. [447]

"Now I set down the knife," the performer announced. [457] In her palm lay a small wooden bird, wings spread as if caught between flying and falling. [475] "I place it among the dried flowers." [482]

The arrangement looked strange—preserved death cradling carved possibility. [490] Mrs. Chen reached out, touched one brittle petal. [499] It crumbled, but somehow the destruction felt like release. [508]

"This concludes today's session," the performer said, rising. [516] Her blank face turned toward the window where turbines sliced endlessly through sky. [529] "Tomorrow I will teach you to peel potatoes as if uncovering stars." [542]

After she left, Mrs. Chen held the wooden bird, feeling its impossible lightness. [555] Outside, the turbines hummed their mechanical mantras, but inside the farmhouse, a different kind of quiet settled. [572] Not the enforced cheer of the mandate, not the heavy silence of hidden grief, but something in between—a remade hush where sorrow could exist weightlessly, where emptiness became its own form of resistance. [607]

She placed the bird back among the dried flowers and practiced narrating aloud: "Now I am learning to breathe." [627] The words fell flat, emotionless, perfect. [633] "Now I am remembering without drowning." [639] The turbines cast their shadows. [644] "Now I am becoming lighter." [649]
