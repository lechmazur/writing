The mist curled through the glass atrium like breath through broken teeth, and Mara Chen adjusted the ancient hearing aid against her ear, listening for what the living couldn't hear. [28] As the city's only contact tracer for hearts—those who tracked emotional contagions before they spread into collective grief—she'd learned that twilight was when the dead called loudest. [56]

The device in her ear had belonged to her grandmother, dead now twenty-three years, its circuits somehow attuned to frequencies that modern technology ignored. [79] Tonight, the pulses were different: urgent, fractured, like a heart trying to remember its rhythm. [94]

She moved through the botanical garden's atrium, past orchids that seemed to lean away from her path, their petals trembling in the windless air. [119] The photograph in her pocket—the last one taken before the Silence began three days ago—showed seventeen residents of Willowbrook Care Home, smiling at someone's birthday party. [147] Now, all seventeen were catatonic, their hearts beating but their consciousness somewhere else, somewhere Mara needed to find. [165]

The hearing aid crackled. [169] A voice, paper-thin: "They're taking our words." [176]

Mara had never intended to become this—a guardian of vulnerable voices, a detective of the departed. [192] She'd been an audiologist, persistently curious about why some patients heard things others couldn't, when she'd discovered that certain grief patterns were contagious, spreading through communities like invisible wildfire. [223] The city had hired her to trace these outbreaks, to find their source before entire neighborhoods fell silent. [241]

"Who's taking them?" she whispered to the mist. [249] The atrium's glass ceiling filtered the dying light into amber fragments that caught in the moisture, creating a cathedral of suspended gold. [273]

The pulse in her ear shifted, became a pattern: three short, three long, three short. [289] SOS. [290] But older than radio code—this was the rhythm of a frightened heart, the telegraph of terror that bodies sent when words failed. [313]

She followed the pulse deeper into the atrium, where tropical plants created caves of green shadow. [329] Here, the mist was thicker, and she could taste copper on her tongue—the flavor of electrical interference, of boundaries wearing thin. [352]

The photograph grew warm in her pocket. [359] She pulled it out and gasped; one by one, the faces were fading, starting from the edges, as if being erased by an unseen hand. [384] Only the birthday woman remained clear, her mouth open mid-laugh, but her eyes—her eyes were looking directly at Mara, though the photo had been taken three days ago. [413]

"I can help you," Mara said, trying to assure both the dead and herself. [427] "But you need to show me what happened." [435]

The hearing aid shrieked, then settled into a rhythm she recognized: the syncopated beat of "Happy Birthday," but played in a minor key, slowed down until it became a dirge. [466] She closed her eyes and let the sound guide her, each pulse a breadcrumb through the veil. [483]

Then she understood. [486] The birthday woman—Mrs. Valdez—had been the first to go silent. [497] Not from disease or age, but from theft. [505] Someone at the care home had been harvesting memories, collecting final moments, last words, the precious currency of the dying. [525] They'd taken too much from Mrs. Valdez, and her silence had spread like a virus of forgetting, each resident's voice following hers into the void. [551]

The hearing aid pulsed once more, stronger now, and Mara felt the location like a needle in her mind: the basement of Willowbrook, where someone was hoarding stolen voices. [581]

She ran from the atrium into the falling night, the photograph clutched in her hand, the faces returning as she moved closer to their stolen selves. [607] She hadn't meant to be a hero—had only been persistently curious about the sounds others couldn't hear. [624] But sometimes heroism was incidental, born from simply refusing to let vulnerable voices disappear into the reeling hush of forgetting. [644]

Behind her, the mist began to lift, and somewhere in the city, seventeen hearts remembered how to speak. [662]
