The mercury-glass seer lived deep within the mountain's hollow chambers, where ancient books formed walls that spiraled upward through carved stone. [20] Her eyes, silver-blind from decades of reading futures in liquid metal, could no longer decipher printed words. [36] Instead, she navigated the labyrinthine bookstore by trailing her fingers along leather spines, feeling stories through worn bindings. [54]

Each night, she substituted reality with visions drawn from mercury pools scattered throughout the mountain's reading rooms. [71] In these silver dreams, she searched for something she'd lost when remembering became painful—when the weight of ten thousand witnessed futures crushed her ability to recall her own past. [101]

The lost language stone had arrived yesterday, delivered by a trembling scholar who'd found it wedged between volumes of dead alphabets. [123] Its surface bore inscriptions in a script that predated all known writing, carved so finely that even her sensitive fingertips couldn't trace them. [147] But when she held it against her cheek, she felt its message like the texture of a feather—soft warnings brushing against her consciousness. [172]

"This stone speaks of buried talents," she whispered to the empty reading chamber, her voice echoing off book-lined walls that rose into darkness. [196] The mercury in her seeing bowl rippled without wind, reflecting not her face but the shadow of who she'd been before the gift of prophecy had consumed everything else. [227]

Long ago, before she'd become the mountain's oracle, she'd been a gardener. [240] Her hands had known soil and seed, had coaxed life from barren ground with patience and understanding. [257] That talent lay buried now beneath years of silver visions, each prophecy adding another layer of forgetting over her original self. [279]

The stone grew warm in her palm. [286] Through it, she felt memories returning—not as images but as sensations. [298] The particular ache of kneeling in fresh-turned earth. [307] The smell of rain approaching over planted fields. [316] The satisfaction of seeing the first green shoots emerge. [325] These memories hurt, as all remembering did now, but they also pulled her toward something essential she'd lost. [343]

She moved through the bookstore's winding passages, following a path she'd never taken before. [357] The stone guided her downward, through sections where books grew older and stranger, their pages made of materials that weren't quite paper. [380] Here, knowledge had been pressed into bark, scratched onto shells, woven into fabric. [394] The mountain held not just books but every form humanity had ever used to preserve meaning. [410]

At the mountain's heart, she found it: a chamber where no books lived. [424] Instead, dark soil covered the floor, rich and waiting. [434] Overhead, a natural skylight let in the first starlight she'd seen in decades. [448] The lost language stone pulsed against her chest, its inscriptions finally readable—not through sight or touch, but through recognition. [469]

The stone contained seeds. [473] Not literal ones, but the memory of seeds, the potential of seeds, the promise that buried talents could grow again if given proper ground. [497] She understood then what she'd been searching for in all those mercury visions: not her past, but permission to plant a future. [520]

Kneeling in the soil, she pressed the stone deep into the earth. [533] The texture of its surface, feather-soft yet eternal, dissolved into the waiting ground. [547] Something thundered in the distance—not sound but possibility, hidden in the mountain's bones. [561]

For the first time since prophecy had claimed her, she didn't seek visions of tomorrow. [577] Instead, she planted. [580] Her blind fingers remembered their older purpose, creating small furrows, spacing them properly, working by instinct rather than sight. [599] She seeded the chamber with fragments of the lost language, each one a buried talent waiting to emerge. [618]

Months later, when green shoots finally pushed through the dark soil, they grew into something unprecedented: plants that bloomed with words, their leaves inscribed with stories that helped visitors remember who they'd been before loss reshaped them. [657] The mercury-glass seer tended this garden within the mountain, understanding at last the shape of home—not a place returned to, but a talent recovered and transformed. [685] The labyrinthine bookstore had gained a living collection, where buried gifts could take root and grow toward light. [704]

Hidden thunder rolled through the mountain's passages whenever someone discovered the garden, that quiet rumble of recognition when a lost part of oneself suddenly resurfaces. [729] The seer's silver eyes could not see the garden's colors, but she felt its growth through her fingertips, through the soil that remembered her first calling. [757] She had learned to read the future in mercury, but here she grew it from seeds. [774]
