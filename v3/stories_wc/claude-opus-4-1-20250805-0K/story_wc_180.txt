The quartz-eye mender had sworn she would never return to the cathedral, but deciduous vows—like autumn leaves—were meant to fall away when their season ended. [25] Elara pushed through the rotting oak doors, her weathered hands trembling not from age but from memory. [42] Above, where stained glass once filtered holy light, apple trees now grew wild through the broken rafters, their branches heavy with forbidden fruit. [66]

"You're late," called a voice from the canopy. [74] Her granddaughter Mira swung down from a rope ladder, landing with practiced grace despite her twelve years. [91] The girl was endearingly feisty, all knobby elbows and fierce determination, wearing torn stockings and a defiant grin. [109]

"The contract was breached three days ago," Mira continued, hands on her hips. [122] "The Council said you wouldn't come." [128]

Elara touched the faded blue ribbon in her pocket—Mira's mother's, saved from happier times before the schism that split their family's guild of crystal healers. [153] "The Council says many things that prove untrue." [161]

The cathedral's transformation had begun twenty years ago, after the breach of contract between the Mender's Guild and the Church. [181] When holy men fled, nature claimed their sanctuary. [189] Seeds carried by wind and bird had taken root in accumulated dust and bird droppings along the rafters. [207] Now pear, apple, and cherry trees formed a suspended forest, their roots threading through stonework like determined fingers. [226]

"They're dying," Mira said simply, pointing upward. [233] Through gaps in the foliage, Elara glimpsed them: dozens of quartz eyes, hanging like peculiar fruit from silken threads. [252] These were the seeing stones, crystalline organs that replaced diseased human eyes—the last batch her daughter had crafted before her death. [275]

"Without proper mending, they'll go dark forever," Mira persisted, though her voice cracked. [289] "You're the only one left who knows the old ways." [300]

Elara had sworn never to practice the mending arts again, but that vow had been born of grief, not wisdom. [321] She fumbled with her traveling sack, forgotten in her haste. [332] Inside, beneath a moldy sandwich and yesterday's newspaper, her fingers found familiar shapes: the silver tuning fork that sang to crystal, the bottle of tears collected under a full moon, and—unexpectedly—her daughter's tools. [369]

"I packed the wrong bag," she muttered, then laughed at the lie. [382] There were no accidents in a mender's life, only patterns waiting to reveal themselves. [397]

She climbed the rope ladder with surprising agility, Mira following. [407] Among the branches, she saw the true scope of the problem. [419] The quartz eyes pulsed weakly, their inner light fading like dying stars. [432] Each one represented someone's sight, someone's hope. [439]

"Your mother understood something I didn't," Elara said, withdrawing the tuning fork. [451] Its tone rang pure through the organic cathedral, making the crystals resonate in response. [466] "She knew that wisdom isn't preserved through isolation but through teaching." [477]

She showed Mira how to apply the tears, each drop precisely placed to heal the microscopic fractures. [495] The girl's hands were steady, her concentration absolute. [503] She had her mother's gift, buried beneath youthful rebellion. [512]

"Why did you really leave?" Mira asked as they worked. [523]

Elara considered her words carefully while adjusting a particularly damaged eye. [534] "I thought protecting tradition meant keeping it pure, unchanged." [543] She gestured at the thriving orchard around them. [551] "But look what grows when we let go of our rigid structures." [564]

The first mended eye blazed back to life, casting rainbow patterns through apple blossoms. [578] Then another, and another, until the abandoned cathedral glowed with renewed purpose. [590]

Mira tied her grandmother's blue ribbon in her own wild hair, a bridge between past and future. [608] "The Council won't like this," she said, grinning. [617]

"Good," Elara replied, pulling her granddaughter close. [624] "The best wisdom usually arrives by accident, disguised as something else entirely." [637]

Together they descended, leaving the orchard cathedral brighter than they'd found it, their deciduous vow to never work together falling away like leaves that had served their purpose. [668] The quartz eyes watched over them, mended and gleaming, proof that some breaches could become doorways if one simply persisted long enough to see them clearly. [695]

In her forgotten bag, the tools hummed with satisfaction, ready to be passed on. [710]
