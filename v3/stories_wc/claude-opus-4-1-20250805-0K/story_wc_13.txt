Marina's pencil froze above the unfinished moth wing as the infinity pendant at her throat began to hum. [17] The natural history illustrations scattered across her desk—extinct birds, impossible insects, creatures that existed only in the margins of time—started to flutter as if alive. [41] She knew what this meant: another interruption in the world's cadence, another gap where something essential had been caged. [60]

The rooftop canal system of Chronos City stretched before her as she climbed through her studio skylight, water flowing impossibly upward between the towers, defying gravity through ancient engineering. [89] These waterways had been built during the last age, when humanity discovered that time wasn't linear but sculptable, like clay in the hands of those who understood its true nature. [119] Marina was one of the few who could perceive the interruptions—moments where time's natural rhythm skipped, leaving creatures trapped between heartbeats. [139]

Her pendant, inherited from her grandmother who'd been the city's first temporal naturalist, pointed toward the eastern district where the giant Morteus slumbered. [163] His naps lasted exactly seventy-seven years, and during each one, the city's time-sculptors could work freely, borrowing minutes from his dreams to redistribute among the urgent living. [191] But this practice had consequences: echoes of extinct creatures became trapped in the borrowed time, unable to complete their final moments. [212]

Marina leaped between canal boats, her illustration satchel waterproofed and secure. [224] The water here ran thick with temporal residue, carrying fragments of unfinished stories toward the giant's breathing chambers. [243] She'd been searching for months for the source of these echoes—the place where lost sounds went to be born again, where she could finally uncage the creatures frozen in her inherited illustrations. [277]

The pendant's humming intensified as she approached Morteus's vast form, his body integrated into the city's architecture, buildings constructed around his limbs. [301] His current nap had lasted seventy-six years and eleven months; she had perhaps days before he stirred. [319] The time-sculptors worked frantically nearby, siphoning dream-minutes through crystalline tubes, but Marina ignored them. [336] She followed the canal that spiraled around the giant's throat, where his snores created ripples in time itself. [354]

There—a gap in his breathing, an interrupted cadence that shouldn't exist. [366] Marina dove through it, her pendant protecting her from the temporal shear. [378] Inside, she found herself in a vast chamber of suspended moments: here flew the last passenger pigeon, there swam the final golden toad, all caught mid-motion, their deaths incomplete. [409] This was where the city's borrowed time came from—not from Morteus's dreams, but from stealing the final moments of the extinct. [431]

Marina understood now why her grandmother had left her both the pendant and the illustrations. [446] Each drawing was a key, a promise to return what had been borrowed. [459] She pulled out her sketches and began to complete them, adding the final details she'd always instinctively avoided—the last wingbeat, the final breath, the closing of eyes. [487] As she drew, the creatures began to move, their interrupted cadences resuming. [500] The passenger pigeon completed its fall, the golden toad finished its dive, each extinction finally allowed its ending. [518]

The chamber shook as Morteus began to stir prematurely, the stolen time returning to its rightful place. [536] Marina ran back through the closing gap, the canal water now flowing in reverse as the city's temporal architecture readjusted. [557] The time-sculptors screamed in panic as their borrowed minutes evaporated, but Marina felt only relief. [573] She'd found where echoes were born—not in sound, but in the space between ending and absence, where every extinction waited to be acknowledged. [597]

Her pendant grew quiet against her throat as she reached her studio, the infinity symbol now cracked down its center. [617] The illustrations on her desk had changed: no longer frozen moments but completed stories, each creature finally at rest. [636] Outside, Morteus opened ancient eyes, and for the first time in ages, the city's cadence rang true and uninterrupted. [656] Marina picked up her pencil and began to draw new subjects—living creatures, present and real, their time their own. [675]

In finding where echoes were born, she'd learned that some things weren't meant to be preserved in borrowed time, but honored in their ending. [700] The rooftop canals ran clear now, carrying only water between the towers, as time itself resumed its natural, uninterrupted flow. [721]
