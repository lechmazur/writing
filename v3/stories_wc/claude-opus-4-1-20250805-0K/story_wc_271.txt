The arboretum had outlived its keepers, just as Amira had outlived her wedding guests. [13] She sat among the untended olive trees, their branches wild now, reaching toward the Mediterranean far below the cliff. [31] The last lighthouse keeper had abandoned his post three years ago, leaving only automated beacons to warn ships away from the rocks. [53] In her pocket, she carried the crumpled photograph—the only image that survived the strike, edges burned, faces still visible beneath the char. [76]

Her hands moved without thought, pruning dead growth from a neglected rosemary bush. [90] The other volunteers who occasionally visited never noticed how the plants she touched seemed to understand exactly where to grow, how to curve toward light. [116] This quiet talent had emerged after the bombing, as if trauma had opened channels between her nervous system and the green world. [139] 

When the tremor started in her chest—that familiar tightening that preceded panic—she froze. [154] Not from fear, but with practiced intention. [161] Dr. Mansour had taught her to read these somatic markers like weather signs: the flutter beneath her ribs meant memory approaching, the heat in her palms meant anger, the cold at her spine meant grief. [197] Each sensation was a message her body sent before her mind could process what was coming. [214]

She pressed her palm against the rough bark of an ancient cedar. [227] Here was her pearl of stillness—this single point of contact between her skin and something that had witnessed centuries. [247] The tree had seen Ottoman ships, British warplanes, Israeli jets, and now drones that moved like wasps against the sky. [268] It had survived them all by simply continuing to grow. [279]

The photograph crackled as she smoothed it against her thigh. [290] Her sister's face, half-obscured by damage, smiled at something beyond the frame. [304] They'd been arranging flowers when the first explosion hit. [313] White orchids everywhere, then white phosphorus, then white sheets covering the row of bodies. [328] The investigators called it a signature strike—suspicious patterns of gathering, they said, as if joy itself had become suspect. [349]

A cutting from a jade plant rested in her canvas bag. [361] She'd bring it to the greenhouse tomorrow, root it properly, watch it multiply into dozens of small, resilient offspring. [381] This was how she anchored optimism in realism—not through denial of horror, but through the stubborn act of cultivation. [401] Each plant she propagated was both acknowledgment and refusal: yes, they could destroy everything in seconds, but life insisted on returning, slower, quieter, inevitable. [426]

The wind shifted, bringing salt and the cry of gulls. [437] Below, waves carved the cliff face with patient erosion. [446] She thought of the lighthouse keeper, whoever he was, choosing to leave his post. [461] Perhaps he'd understood what she was learning: some forms of guidance required no human presence, only structures built to last. [482]

Her body's signals quieted as she worked, transplanting a struggling sapling to better soil. [497] The somatic markers that once screamed danger at every distant engine sound had learned to distinguish between aircraft types, between memories and present threats. [522] Her nervous system was recalibrating, slowly, like a compass finding north after magnetic interference. [537]

The arboretum would rewild without intervention, but not randomly. [547] She'd spent months placing species that would naturalize together, creating succession patterns that would unfold over decades. [565] Mediterranean natives alongside hardy immigrants, each finding their niche in the clifftop ecosystem. [579] When the last volunteer stopped coming—and they would, eventually—the garden would remember her hands in its very structure. [599]

As sunset approached, she tucked the photograph back into her pocket and gathered her tools. [615] Tomorrow she would return, and the day after. [624] Not because healing demanded it, but because the plants grew regardless of human tragedy, and there was something essential in aligning herself with that indifference. [650] It wasn't forgetting—it was finding a rhythm larger than grief. [661] She climbed the stone steps back toward the road, leaving the arboretum to its evening chorus of insects and wind, carrying with her that pearl of stillness she'd cultivated between her body and the earth. [697]

In the abandoned lighthouse, the automated beacon began its nightly rotation, sweeping light across water and cliff, arboretum and ruins, the living and the dead. [724] Amira drove home through its periodic illumination, her hands steady on the wheel, dirt still dark beneath her fingernails. [745] The world would continue its violence. [751] She would continue her planting. [756] Both facts existed simultaneously, without resolution, only the quiet persistence of growth against erasure. [771]
