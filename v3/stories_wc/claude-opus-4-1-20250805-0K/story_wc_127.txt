The amber grotto caught the last light of dusk, transforming its crystalline walls into pools of liquid gold. [17] Vera ran her fingers along the smooth surface, static electricity crackling between her skin and the ancient resin. [34] Through that electric connection, she could sense them—the half-truths trapped inside, preserved like the insects suspended within the amber itself. [54]

As a counterfeit emotion dealer, Vera had built her reputation on being professionally thorough. [68] She never sold feelings that were entirely false; that would be crude, detectable. [81] Instead, she harvested half-truths from places like this—emotions that were genuine once, but incomplete, missing their context or conclusion. [102] The grotto was her most reliable source, its amber walls having absorbed centuries of visitors' confessions, prayers, and whispered secrets. [124]

She pulled the fragrance chemist's blotter petal from her leather satchel, its white surface pristine and absorbent. [141] The petal wasn't just for testing scents anymore; she'd modified it to capture emotional resonances through static discharge. [160] As she pressed it against the amber, sparks danced across its surface, and the petal began to darken with absorbed impressions. [182]

"There you are," she murmured with affectionate detachment, watching a particularly vivid streak of burgundy spread across the petal. [202] This one tasted of a mother's love—but only the protective part, not the letting-go. [218] Perfect for her client who wanted to feel cherished without the accompanying guilt of independence. [233]

The transformation was beginning now, as it always did at this exact moment of dusk. [249] The amber grotto shifted from mere mineral to something more permeable, its molecular structure loosening just enough to release what it had held. [273] Vera had discovered this phenomenon years ago: the precise instant when day surrendered to night, the grotto became generous with its treasures. [297]

She worked methodically, pressing the petal to different sections of the wall, each contact revealing new half-truths. [315] A father's pride divorced from disappointment. [322] A lover's passion without the subsequent betrayal. [329] Joy untethered from its inevitable loss. [336] Each emotion was real, had been real, but now existed in this truncated form—honest in its incompleteness. [354]

The static electricity intensified as the transformation progressed, making her dark hair stand on end. [369] Through the electromagnetic field, she could sense the deeper patterns: how these partial emotions yearned to be whole again, how they pulled toward completion like magnets seeking their opposite poles. [401] This was why her work succeeded where others failed—she understood that people didn't want false feelings, they wanted true feelings without their painful edges. [426]

As the petal filled with its harvest, Vera felt the familiar pull to subsume these emotions herself, to let them flow through her and complete their broken circuits. [455] It would be so easy to absorb them all, to finally feel something genuine instead of trafficking in others' severed sentiments. [476] But that would violate her cardinal rule: never consume the merchandise. [487]

The transformation was nearly complete now, the grotto's amber walls beginning to solidify again. [501] She had perhaps another minute before they would seal shut until tomorrow's dusk. [515] Vera pressed the petal against her chest, letting the static field align with her heartbeat. [530] This was the crucial moment—to fuse insight with empathy, to understand not just what emotions to harvest, but which ones would truly serve her clients' needs. [557]

She thought of tomorrow's appointment: a widower who wanted to remember his wife's laughter without the silence that followed. [575] The petal held exactly what he needed—joy preserved in amber, authentic but mercifully incomplete. [590] 

As the last light faded and the grotto sealed itself, Vera tucked the petal carefully away. [607] She climbed the carved steps toward the surface, leaving the amber grotto to its ancient work of preserving half-truths, those merciful lies that are truer than honesty itself. [637] In her profession, she'd learned that sometimes the kindest thing wasn't to give people whole emotions, but to offer them the parts they could bear to hold. [666] The static electricity still tingled on her fingertips as she emerged into the night, carrying her harvest of incomplete truths, each one a small mercy in a world that often loved too sharply.
