The letterpress clicked in syncopation with the dying stars above, each mechanical heartbeat marking another celestial erasure from the night sky. [20] Mira worked beneath the open roof of her topaz workshop, where crystalline walls caught and refracted the diminishing starlight into prismatic patterns across her printing plates. [46] She had chosen this remote mesa specifically for its view of the constellation Empatheia, though three of its seven stars had already vanished this week. [71]

"Who shall I be tonight?" she murmured, fingers dancing across the worn type cases. [85] The question wasn't rhetorical—it was necessary preparation. [92] Each client who commissioned her cryptic broadsheets expected to work with someone who truly understood their emotional landscape, and Mira had developed an unsettling gift for borrowing their personalities wholesale. [121] Not mimicry, but a complete transposition of self, as if she could solve for X in the equation where X equaled another person's soul. [146]

Tonight's client had sent only a halo fragment—a curved splinter of luminous metal that hummed with residual divinity. [165] She pressed it against her temple and felt the familiar dissolution begin. [177] Her own thoughts became variables in someone else's formula: grief multiplied by infinity, divided by the square root of abandonment. [197] The mathematics of emotion had always fascinated her, but lately she'd discovered something disturbing. [211] Each borrowed personality left traces, like overlapping prints on her press plates, creating messages within messages. [226]

The workshop's topaz walls began to pulse as another star flickered overhead. [238] Between these vanishings, in those liminal moments when light became memory, Mira could feel all her borrowed selves simultaneously. [257] The sensation was what she called lucid turbulence—perfectly clear chaos, like reading seventeen different texts printed on transparent sheets stacked atop each other. [280]

She began setting type, her movements now infused with the halo fragment's donor—someone who had lost faith catastrophically, whose equations all divided by zero. [305] The letters she chose seemed random: "THE HORIZON DRINKS LIGHT / YOUR SHADOW PRECEDES YOU / BY THREE DAYS." [320] But nothing was random in her work. [327] Each message was precisely calibrated to disorient through deliberate ambiguity, to make readers question which thoughts were originally theirs. [346]

As she worked, Mira felt her latest borrowed personality arguing with the others she'd accumulated. [361] A merchant's pragmatism wrestled with a child's wonder, while a soldier's discipline tried to impose order on a poet's associative leaps. [383] The mathematics grew increasingly complex—emotional derivatives, sentimental integrals, the calculus of human connection. [397]

The letterpress thundered as she pulled the first proof. [406] The ink appeared silver under the dying starlight, but she knew it would shift to gold by dawn, then to the color of forgetting by noon. [432] This was her true art: creating documents that changed meaning based on who read them, when, and what they brought to the interpretation. [456]

Another star vanished. [459] The constellation Empatheia now had only four lights, barely enough to maintain its mythological shape. [474] Mira understood with sudden clarity that she wasn't just borrowing personalities anymore—she was preserving them, like pressed flowers between pages. [496] Each transposed empathy was a star saved from extinction, translated into the mathematics of ink and pressure, word and absence. [517]

The halo fragment grew warm against her skin, and she felt its owner's presence more strongly. [534] An angel, perhaps, or someone who had stood too close to divinity and fractured. [549] Their sorrow tasted like metal and ozone. [556] Their joy had the texture of falling. [563]

She printed a hundred copies as the night wore on, each one slightly different, each one a solution to the equation of someone who might read it. [590] The topaz workshop filled with drying sheets, their messages creating a constellation of meaning to replace the failing stars above. [611] When dawn finally came, Mira couldn't remember which personality was originally hers, but she had finally understood something crucial: emotion wasn't mathematics at all. [636] It was typography—the art of arranging empty space around meaning, of making absence as eloquent as presence. [653] She touched the halo fragment one last time and felt all her borrowed selves align into a single, impossible truth: everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts. [683]

The letterpress fell silent. [687] Above her, the last star of Empatheia held on, defiant. [697] Mira smiled with seventeen different mouths. [703]
