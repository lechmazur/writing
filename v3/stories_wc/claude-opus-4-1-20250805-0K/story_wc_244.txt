The ivy had claimed Platform Three entirely, transforming the abandoned Millbrook Station into something between architecture and forest. [17] Sadie Chen, disaster-relief logistician extraordinaire and professional ghost, arrived precisely when she meant to--which was never when anyone expected. [35]

"Terribly sorry about the raccoons," she called out to the shadows, her voice carrying that desperately jocular edge she'd perfected in Mozambique after the cyclone. [56] "They're union now, apparently. [60] Very strict about territorial negotiations." [65]

From behind a pillar wrapped in decades of green emerged Marcus, holding a thermos like a peace offering. [83] "The rumor said you'd only come if someone brought Ethiopian coffee," he said. [96]

"Malaysian, actually," Sadie corrected, accepting the thermos with a bow that managed to be both mocking and sincere. [113] "But close enough for government work--which this decidedly isn't." [122]

She'd started the rumor chain herself, naturally. [129] Whispered to a bartender in Prague that she needed moon dust for a water purification system. [145] The bartender told his brother-in-law, who mentioned it to a mineralogist, who posted on an obscure forum, where Marcus--lonely Marcus with his fragment of actual moon rock and his desperate need to matter--had taken the bait. [184]

"You have it?" [187] Sadie asked, though she already knew. [193] She could smell the metallic otherness of it, that particular absence of Earth that made lunar samples unmistakable. [211]

Marcus produced a small vial, the grey fragment inside no larger than a fingernail. [226] "My grandfather worked on Apollo missions," he said. [234] "This was his retirement gift--technically illegal, but--" [242]

"Everything worthwhile is technically illegal," Sadie interrupted, her grin sharp enough to cut glass. [256] "That's what makes it interesting." [262]

The truth was simpler and more complex than Marcus could imagine. [273] Sadie didn't need moon rock for water purification. [281] She needed it to catalyze something far more volatile: human connection. [292]

"I'll trade you," she said, producing a satellite phone from her bag. [305] "This phone has exactly one number programmed. [313] Once a month, it will ring. [319] Someone who needs help will be on the other end. [329] Real help. [331] Not sympathy, not charity--partnership." [336]

Marcus stared at the phone. [341] "That's it?" [343]

"That's everything," Sadie said, and for a moment, her jocular mask slipped. [355] "Every disaster I've worked, the loneliest people aren't the victims--they're the ones watching from safety, desperate to help but not knowing how." [379]

She'd learned this through seventeen floods, nine earthquakes, and one nuclear meltdown that officially never happened. [396] Each time, she'd disappeared before the thank-you ceremonies, leaving only rumor chains in her wake. [412] Stories of the woman who could procure anything, fix anything, disappear into anything. [425]

"Why the moon rock?" [429] Marcus asked. [431]

"Because you wouldn't have come for anything less rare," Sadie said simply. [444] "And because I need it for someone in Myanmar who believes--correctly, as it happens--that lunar minerals can neutralize certain toxins in groundwater." [467] She pocketed the vial. [471] "Reciprocity isn't charity, Marcus. [476] It's the only economy that actually works." [484]

The ivy rustled around them, a green cathedral of abandoned intentions. [495] This station had once connected six towns, carried lovers and workers and dreamers. [509] Now it connected nothing except this moment to the next. [519]

Marcus took the phone. [523] When it rang three weeks later, he would find himself talking to a teacher in Bangladesh who needed three hundred water filters. [544] He would discover he knew someone who knew someone. [554] The chain would grow. [558]

Sadie was already leaving, stepping backwards into the green shadows. [567] "The cure for loneliness isn't company," she called out, that desperate jocularity back in full force. [584] "It's purpose tangled up with other people's purposes until you can't tell where you end and the world begins." [604]

Marcus stood alone on the platform, holding the phone, understanding finally that he'd been catalyzed. [619] The ivy whispered agreements in the wind. [626] Somewhere, Sadie Chen was already becoming another rumor, another impossible story that happened to be true. [642]

The abandoned station held its breath, waiting for the next transaction in the economy of human need. [659]

Polite anarchy, Sadie called it. [664] The only government worth having. [669]
