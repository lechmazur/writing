The jade cicada caught moonlight between Mira's fingers, its carved wings translucent as the moment stretching between her and her former mentor. [20] Above them, stars wheeled through the grotto's opening, their light pooling on wet stone where centuries of high tides had left their stories. [40]

"You think I abandoned the work," Professor Chen said finally, his voice echoing off barnacle-crusted walls. [56] The pause that followed wasn't silence—it hummed with the susurration of retreating waves, the click of hermit crabs reorganizing themselves, the patient drip of seawater returning home. [79]

Mira turned the jade cicada slowly, watching how it transformed the starlight. [91] As the coast's only remaining tidal-pool chronicler, she'd learned that truth rarely announced itself directly. [106] Instead, it emerged sideways, like the spider crab she'd observed that morning, approaching its molted shell from three different angles before committing to transformation. [129]

"I think," she said warmly, setting the cicada on a flat stone between them, "that you discovered something about time that frightened you." [153]

The grotto had been their laboratory once, when Chen still believed in documenting the microscopic symphonies of intertidal zones. [172] Each pool contained its own civilization, rising and falling with lunar reliability. [184] They would spend hours recording the delicate negotiations between anemones and clownfish, the territorial disputes of limpets, the patient architecture of barnacles building their calcium cities. [209]

Chen picked up the jade cicada, a artifact from the previous chronicler who'd worked these pools during the Ming Dynasty. [229] "Do you know why cicadas?" [234] he asked. [236] "Seventeen years underground, then transformation, song, death—all in a single summer." [248] His fingers traced the ancient carving's wings. [255] "I started seeing it everywhere in the pools." [263]

Mira knew what he meant. [268] Yesterday, she'd watched a sea star regenerate a lost arm while simultaneously dissolving a mussel with its stomach—destruction and creation occurring in the same prolonged moment. [293] Time in the pools moved differently, each creature operating on its own schedule while somehow synchronizing with the larger rhythm of tides. [316]

"The pause," Chen continued, his words careful as footsteps on wet rock, "between one state and another—that's where everything actually happens." [338] He gestured to a pool where the receding tide had left a perfect mirror of stars. [354] "I could foresee the patterns, Mira." [360] His voice dropped. [363] "Not just the next tide, but the next transition for every creature in every pool." [379] He set down the cicada. [384] "The weight of that knowledge..." [389]

Mira understood now why he'd retreated to studying dead specimens in university labs. [402] The burden of witnessing so many simultaneous transformations—eggs becoming larvae, polyps budding into medusae, crabs abandoning shells that no longer fit—could overwhelm anyone seeking simple answers. [429]

She picked up the jade cicada, feeling its cool weight. [439] "But that's exactly why the work matters," she said, her voice carrying the same patient certainty she used when teaching children to observe without disturbing. [464] "Someone needs to witness the texture of these transitions." [473]

A wave larger than the rest swept into the grotto, rearranging the topography of their conversation. [489] In its wake, bioluminescent plankton sparkled like fallen stars, each point of light marking another life in transition. [508]

Chen watched the display with the expression Mira remembered from their early days—wonder tempered by scientific precision. [526] "You're not frightened?" [529] he asked. [531]

"Frightened?" [532] Mira smiled, placing the jade cicada back in his palm and closing his fingers around it. [548] "I'm a chronicler." [551] She gestured to the pools surrounding them, each one a universe parsing time in its own dialect. [568] "Fear would mean believing these transitions are endings." [576] A hermit crab emerged from hiding, considering a new shell. [586] "But watch long enough, document carefully enough, and you realize—" [596] She paused, letting the grotto's acoustic architecture carry her words. [606] "Every ending is just the pause before another beginning." [615]

Above them, the stars continued their ancient rotation, and below, the pools prepared for the returning tide, each creature poised in its own perfect transition. [640] Chen nodded slowly, understanding passing between them like the jade cicada—solid, ancient, and translucent all at once. [658] Tomorrow, Mira knew, he would return to help with the chronicle. [670] The pools had already foretold it in their patient, sideways way. [682]
