The ferry's horn echoed through dimensions as Marcus gripped the rusted rail, watching his thousandth crossing dissolve into mist. [17] Each night, the *Meridian Passage* materialized at precisely 11:47, when clocks run sideways and time folds into itself. [35] Marcus had been its only deckhand for three years now—or was it thirty? [49] Time meant nothing when you worked a vanishing commuter ferry between parallel worlds. [62]

Tonight felt different. [65] The empty hourglass in his pocket hummed against his ribs, its absent sand a paradox he'd grown to cherish. [85] Where others saw futility in an hourglass without sand, Marcus recognized potential—infinite moments suspended between never and always. [104]

"Captain, we're losing coherence again," he radioed to the wheelhouse, though static answered as usual. [120] The captain existed three timelines over, steering through probability while Marcus maintained their anchor to this particular reality. [139] Their communication worked via interconnected patterns: a horn blast here, a light flash there, messages threading through the cosmic weave. [160]

The ferry groaned as it approached the spectral grotto under starlight, where limestone cliffs phased between solid and ethereal. [180] Here, beneath constellations that spelled different stories in each timeline, passengers would board—commuters whose destinations existed in futures they hadn't chosen yet. [203]

Marcus smiled, his resiliently positive nature undimmed by the existential weight of his work. [217] While others might despair at ferrying souls between realities they'd never fully inhabit, he found purpose in the permanent transience. [238] Every passenger carried potential futures in their briefcases and backpacks, alternative lives tucked into coat pockets. [254]

A woman materialized on the dock, her edges flickering. [263] She clutched a ticket that existed in seven dimensions simultaneously. [274] Marcus helped her aboard, noting how her reflection in the water showed three different faces—the mother she was, the artist she'd become, the scientist she might have been. [303]

"Which timeline tonight?" [306] Marcus asked gently. [309]

"The one where I said yes," she whispered. [318]

He understood. [320] The ferry specialized in carrying people to the moments where their lives had split, offering passage to the paths untaken. [341] But tonight, Marcus had his own journey to complete. [351]

The empty hourglass grew warmer. [356] For three years—or thirty—he'd collected temporal fragments from each crossing, storing them in the space where sand should flow. [377] Not sand, but moments themselves: a child's laughter from timeline-A, a sunset from timeline-B, a first kiss that happened in C but not in D. [405]

The grotto's starlight intensified, and Marcus saw them—all the versions of himself across infinite timelines, each one a deckhand on their own vanishing ferry. [430] Some were older, weathered by decades of interdimensional service. [440] Others were fresh-faced, still learning to read the patterns in the fog. [453]

He raised the empty hourglass, and its nothingness began to glow. [465] This was why he'd remained resiliently positive through the endless temporary eternities—he'd been gathering the tools to merge parallel timelines, to heal the fractures that kept people shuttling between possibilities instead of living them. [502]

"All hands," he radioed across every frequency, reaching his parallel selves. [514] "Convergence protocol initiated." [517]

The ferry shuddered as timelines began to braid together. [526] The woman passenger gasped as her three reflections merged into one—mother-artist-scientist, all simultaneously true. [541] The spectral grotto solidified, no longer caught between states but existing fully in all of them. [558]

Marcus felt himself expanding and contracting, experiencing every version of his story at once. [572] The empty hourglass shattered, releasing not sand but pure possibility into the night. [586] The vanishing commuter ferry would vanish no more—it would exist permanently in its transience, a bridge between all worlds rather than a ghost between none. [613]

As dawn approached sideways through folded time, Marcus stood on the deck of the now-eternal *Meridian Passage*, still a deckhand but no longer ardent for escape. [641] He'd found his purpose in the perpetual journey, radioing coordinates to souls seeking their unified selves. [657] The ferry sailed on through the spectral grotto, under stars that now told every story at once, carrying passengers not between lives but into the fullness of living them all. [687]

In his pocket, where the empty hourglass had been, Marcus found a compass that pointed to now—every now, always now, forever now. [710] He smiled and prepared for the next boarding. [718]
