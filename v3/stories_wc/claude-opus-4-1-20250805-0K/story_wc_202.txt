The rope bridges swayed between chimney stacks, supporting the ramshackle stalls of the alchemist's market where Mira had first learned her gift. [20] Twenty years ago, as a child clutching her grandmother's hand, she'd discovered she could read the spaces between languages—not just words, but the silences that carried meaning across worlds. [50]

Now she stood before Valdric's painting stall, her fingers trembling over a canvas depicting the old harbor lighthouse. [68] The painting showed the tower as it stood today, abandoned and crumbling, but Mira's eyes caught what others missed: pentimento shadows beneath the paint, earlier versions bleeding through. [97] Each ghosted layer revealed the lighthouse at different moments in history, and in the topmost window of the oldest layer, a glint of crystalline light that shouldn't exist. [126]

"You see it," Valdric whispered, his voice cutting through the market's cacophony of bubbling vials and haggling voices. [144] "The lens fragment." [147]

Mira nodded, her gift stirring—that elusively tangible sense that had always guided her translations. [162] The fragment wasn't just glass; it was a translator itself, built by the seafaring peoples whose language had been erased from official histories. [185] They'd encoded their stories in refractions, each angle of light carrying narratives that colonial scholars had dismissed as mere optical phenomena. [207]

"My grandmother knew them," Mira said, touching the painting's surface. [217] "She taught me their hand-signs before she died, said someone would need them someday." [232]

Valdric produced a palette knife, worn smooth by years of scraping paint. [244] "Then you understand what must be done." [252] He offered her the tool. [257] "Unfasten what time has bound." [263]

The market crowd flowed around them, oblivious to the moment stretching into something infinite. [277] Mira accepted the knife and began her work, carefully lifting paint from canvas, following the anchors of intuition that had always guided her between worlds. [303] Each removed flake revealed more: coordinates written in light-patterns, preservation spells in mercury-silver, testimonies in cobalt blue. [322]

The lighthouse keeper's daughter had hidden the fragment when the colonizers came, Mira translated, reading the visual language emerging beneath her blade. [344] She'd painted over the history, layer by layer, protecting it until someone who could truly see would arrive. [363] The keeper's daughter had been a between-worlds translator too, moving between the language of tides and human speech, between the songs of whales and the needs of sailors. [392]

As Mira worked, the suspended market seemed to fade. [401] The eternal instant expanded, containing both her childhood self learning the old hand-signs and her present self uncovering them again in pigment and glaze. [426] The fragment's location revealed itself not in words but in the interplay of colors: hidden in the lighthouse's foundation, beneath a stone marked with the constellation that appeared only in paintings, never in the actual sky. [465]

"They painted their own stars," Mira breathed, understanding flooding through her. [476] "Created a celestial map that existed only in art, so it couldn't be stolen or destroyed by those who wouldn't honor it." [498]

Valdric smiled, and she noticed his hands bore the same indigo stains her grandmother's had carried—the mark of those who ground lapis for the sacred blue. [526] "The fragment will let you project their stories onto fog and mist," he said. [541] "Make the invisible histories visible again, if only briefly." [550]

Mira pocketed the painting, now transformed into a map. [559] The lighthouse lens fragment called to her across the city below, waiting to cast its truthful light. [576] She thought of her grandmother's words: "Some things are too precious for museums, child. [590] They belong to the spaces between, where translation lives." [599]

The alchemist's market continued its eternal commerce above the rooftops, but Mira descended the rope ladders carrying more than she'd climbed up with. [623] She carried permission to unfasten the past from its painted prison, to honor the overlooked histories that lived in refracted light and patient paint. [648] The fragment would be her tool, but her gift—that elusively tangible ability to read between worlds—would give those lost voices back their song. [673]

Tonight, when fog rolled in from the harbor, she would begin. [685] The stories would dance in droplets of suspended water, visible to all who knew how to look. [703] The eternal instant of recognition would ripple outward, one translated truth at a time. [717]
