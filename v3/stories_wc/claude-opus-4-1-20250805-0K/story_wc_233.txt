Queen Seraphina's softly commanding voice barely stirred the morning mist as she addressed her last remaining guard. [16] "The dreams come every night now, showing me the same thing—starlight bleeding through stone." [30] The guard shifted nervously, knowing what she would ask. [39] Three queens before her had climbed to the ember grotto on the ridge, none returning unchanged. [55] Some never returned at all. [60]

The final warning had come yesterday: a dead raven clutching a silver thread, the traditional herald of succession's approach. [79] Seraphina understood its meaning—either solve the mystery plaguing her bloodline or become another cautionary tale whispered in the cobalt grotto above clouds. [102]

She began her climb at dusk, dismissing her guard with practiced indifference. [114] The path wound through dying gardens where roses bloomed backwards into buds, another sign of the realm's slow unraveling. [134] Each foothold crumbled slightly beneath her weight, as if the mountain itself had grown tired of supporting royalty's ambitions. [154]

The air thinned as she ascended, revealing why locals called it the cobalt grotto—the stone glowed blue-black in twilight, pulsing like a bruised heart. [179] Through gaps in the rock face, she glimpsed bleeding starlight, exactly as her dreams foretold: crimson streams of luminescence seeping through celestial wounds. [203]

Inside the ember grotto, warmth radiated from walls lined with what appeared to be frozen fire—orange crystals that had once been flames, now crystallized into eternal monuments to some ancient burning. [236] Seraphina touched one, and immediately understood why her predecessors had failed. [247] The dreams weren't warnings—they were memories, inherited from the first queen who'd made a terrible bargain here. [264]

The grotto began to whisper, its voice like silk drawn across broken glass. [278] "Every queen carries the same burden, child." [285] The lacy menace in its tone made her skin prickle. [295] "Your great-grandmother traded your lineage's peace for power, and now each of you must climb here to pay a portion of that debt." [319]

Seraphina felt the familiar rage that had driven her from her throne, the disenchantment that made crown and scepter feel like shackles. [341] "What if I refuse?" [345] she asked, though she suspected the answer. [352]

The bleeding starlight intensified, dripping faster through the grotto's ceiling. [362] Where it touched the ember crystals, they flickered back to life, dancing with ghostly flames. [378] "Then your kingdom falls tonight, taking every soul with it." [388] The grotto's laughter was crystalline, sharp. [394] "Your great-grandmother was very specific about the terms." [403]

A movement caught her eye—a firefly, impossible at this altitude, dancing near the grotto's entrance. [419] Then another appeared, and another. [424] Seraphina recognized them: the souls of previous queens, transformed but not destroyed. [436] They pulsed in rhythm with her breathing, and she understood with horrible clarity what the grotto wanted. [453]

"You want me to become one of them," she said, not a question but an acknowledgment. [470] "To guard this place, to ensure the next queen climbs when her dreams begin." [484]

The grotto's silence was answer enough. [490]

Seraphina moved toward the entrance, where mountain air met ancient magic. [501] The fireflies swirled around her, their light both welcome and warning. [512] She could feel the transformation beginning, her flesh growing translucent, her thoughts becoming both larger and simpler. [530]

As her human form dissolved, she shared a final exhale with the other firefly-queens, spotting herself among them as the newest light in their constellation. [555] Together they rose through the cobalt grotto's mouth into the space above clouds, where bleeding starlight painted everything crimson. [575] 

Below, in the kingdom she'd abandoned, a young princess stirred in her sleep, beginning to dream of stone and stars and climbing. [598] The cycle would continue, as it always had, with queens trading their crowns for wings, their kingdoms for a curse's slow unwinding. [621] Seraphina's transformation was complete, her softly commanding presence now just another light guiding the next disenchanted queen toward her destiny. [643]

The ember grotto on the ridge grew quiet again, waiting with infinite patience for the next climber to arrive. [663] After all, there would always be another queen, another dream, another climb toward bleeding starlight. [678] The lacy menace of fate ensured it. [685]
