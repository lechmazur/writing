Mae pressed her palm against the slick barnacle-crusted piling, feeling the tide's rhythm through rotting wood. [14] Her daddy had run moonshine through these same channels forty years back, before the pier became a skeleton hosting darker trades. [32] The antique watch fob in her pocket—his final gift—ticked against her hip bone with each careful step down the makeshift ladder. [53]

Below, the pirate market sprawled in candlelit chaos, vendors hawking contraband beneath dripping beams. [67] Mae moved with curiously steadfast purpose through the maze of tarps and whispers, recording everything on the device hidden in her collar. [89] She needed to capture the sound of trust breaking—that precise moment when loyalty crumbled like wet sand. [106]

"Looking for something specific?" [110] A woman emerged from shadows, teeth gold-capped and knowing. [119]

Mae's first attempt at infiltration had failed when she'd claimed to need weapons. [133] Too obvious. [135] Her second try, posing as a buyer of stolen art, had ended when she couldn't name the right fence. [154] Now, on her third approach, she'd learned: the market respected bloodlines above all else. [169]

"My daddy was Tommy Clearwater," Mae said, letting the watch fob dangle visibly from her fingers. [185] "Ran shine through these waters before you were born." [194]

The woman's expression shifted—recognition blooming like algae in still water. [204] "Tommy's girl." [206] Not a question. [209] "Haven't heard that name in the truce of hush." [218]

The truce of hush—the market's code for the silent years after the last territory war, when everyone pretended peace while sharpening knives. [241] Mae knew the phrase from her father's journals. [249]

"I'm here about the shipment," Mae said, voice steady despite her racing pulse. [262] "The one coming at sunrise." [267]

Around them, the market's nocturnal rhythm continued—deals struck in multiple languages, boxes passed hand to hand, children sleeping on piles of counterfeit designer bags. [290] The comfort in this lawlessness felt like a wool blanket soaked in seawater—heavy, familiar, wrong. [306]

The woman studied Mae's face, then the watch fob. [315] "Your daddy died honest," she said finally. [322] "That's rare currency here." [326]

Mae followed her deeper into the maze, past vendors selling surveillance equipment and forged documents. [341] The recording device captured every murmured transaction, every clink of money changing hands. [354] She was here to thwart the morning's exchange—a shipment of stolen medical supplies meant for the black market, diverted from hurricane relief. [377]

"The buyer arrives at first light," the woman explained, stopping at a booth draped in fishing nets. [394] "But there's a problem." [398]

Mae waited, knowing silence often drew more truth than questions. [408]

"Someone's been recording us," the woman continued, eyes sharp as broken bottles. [420] "Federal agent, we think. [424] Started three nights ago—false starts, amateur moves." [431] She smiled without warmth. [435] "Then they got smarter." [439]

Mae's throat tightened, but she held the woman's gaze. [448] The watch fob grew heavy in her hand, its weight multiplying with each heartbeat. [462]

"My daddy taught me about trust," Mae said slowly. [472] "How it sounds when it breaks." [478] She lifted the watch fob, letting candlelight catch its engraved surface. [489] "Like metal snapping in winter." [494]

The woman reached for the fob, and Mae let her take it. [506] As fingers closed around the heirloom, Mae heard it—that precise sound she'd been hunting. [521] Not through her recording device, but in the sharp intake of breath when the woman found the federal badge hidden in the fob's hidden compartment. [546]

Trust breaking sounded like recognition. [551] Like drowning in reverse. [555]

"Tommy's daughter," the woman repeated, but differently now. [563] "He died honest, and you're finishing his work." [571]

The market's comfortable unease suddenly tilted toward danger. [579] Shadows shifted. [581] Voices dropped. [583] Mae had until sunrise to complete the recording, to gather evidence before the shipment vanished into the gray economy's veins. [602]

"The truce of hush ends with family," the woman said, stepping back into darkness. [616] "You have until the tide changes." [622]

Mae understood—she could finish her father's last case, but then she could never return. [636] The market would remember. [640] She pressed record again, moving steadfast through the remaining hours, capturing the sound of trust breaking and rebuilding, over and over, until dawn painted the rotting pier gold. [669]

When the federal boats arrived at sunrise, Mae stood on the beach, her father's watch fob returned to her pocket, its weight forever changed. [693] The arrest happened in near silence—the market had already dissolved into the morning mist, leaving only empty bottles and the echo of broken trust, perfectly recorded. [721]

Some sounds, Mae learned, were worth the breaking. [729]
