The junkyard prophet squatted in the fog sculpture garden, fingers tracing driftwood arranged like broken compass needles—each splintered arc pointing toward whispers no one else could hear. [18]  
His precognitively forgetful mind flickered: he remembered futures that dissolved before they arrived, leaving only the scent of ozone and the taste of static. [39]  
He clutched a piece of plain chalk, its dusty weight the only anchor against the tide of vanishing moments. [55]  
Amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched—stacked in mildewed towers around him like tombstones of abandoned afternoons—he sought to locate the precise frequency of aging: not the creak of bone or the gray of hair, but the sound of time thickening, like syrup poured in slow motion. [98]  
The fog curled around his ankles, sculpting phantom limbs and half-remembered faces; this garden didn’t grow flowers, but echoes—ghosts of laughter, arguments, lullabies—all clinging stubbornly to the air as if afraid to evaporate. [132]  
He’d been told, long ago, by a woman whose voice now lived only in the static between VHS tracks, that growing older makes a noise: a low, wet sigh, like sandpaper dragged across velvet. [165]  
He believed her. [167]  
Not because he recalled her face—he didn’t—but because her prediction had come true three times already, each time vanishing from his memory seconds after the sound passed, leaving only chalk-dust fingerprints on his palms. [201]  
So he arranged more driftwood today, bleached and salt-stung, salvaged from the tidal flats beyond the scrap heaps. [220]  
Each stick was placed with ritual precision—not to mark north or south, but to triangulate the direction of grief’s echo, the vector of nostalgia’s pull. [246]  
The chalk trembled in his grip. [249]  
It was plain, unremarkable, the kind schoolchildren drop without noticing—but to him, it was a tuning fork. [270]  
When he dragged it across metal or stone, the screech it made wasn’t just noise; it was a lure, bait for the sonic ghosts he hunted. [296]  
He drew a crooked line along a rusted fender half-buried in moss: the chalk shrieked, and for three heartbeats, the fog shuddered into the shape of a child’s birthday song, off-key and distant. [331]  
He wept. [333]  
Not because he recognized the tune—he didn’t—but because its decay felt like his own. [351]  
The prophet’s curse was this: he foresaw moments of profound beauty or sorrow, but forgot them before they bloomed. [375]  
He’d wake with tears on his cheeks and no memory of the dream that caused them. [390]  
His only proof was the chalk—always worn down, always smudged with the residue of sounds he couldn’t recall. [412]  
He located echoes by listening to silence—the way a sailor reads wind in still air. [430]  
Today, the driftwood pointed east-northeast, toward the oldest pile of tapes: Betamax relics wrapped in rubber bands, labeled in fading marker: “Grandma’s Garden, 1987,” “First Steps (Indoors, Sorry),” “Last Summer Before the Move.” [470]  
He knelt before them, breath shallow. [475]  
The fog thickened, responding to his hunger. [479]  
He pressed the chalk to the lid of a plastic case and dragged—slow, deliberate. [492]  
The screech tore open the air. [497]  
And then, beneath it, softer than breath: the sound he’d chased for years. [511]  
It was the crackle of knees bending under new weight, the whisper of skin loosening around elbows, the almost-inaudible pop of a spine adjusting to gravity’s patient siege. [543]  
It was the sound of growing older—not tragic, not triumphant, but tidal. [556]  
Relentless. [557]  
Rhythmic. [558]  
A longing that pulled like moon on wave. [567]  
He dropped the chalk. [570]  
It rolled into the grass, already half-erased by dew. [577]  
He wouldn’t remember this moment tomorrow. [583]  
But the driftwood would remain, angled just so. [590]  
And the tapes, unwatched, would keep their silence. [597]  
And the fog, ever faithful, would sculpt his grief into something visible, if only for an hour. [617]  
He rose, trembling, and walked backward through the garden, so as not to disturb the markers. [637]  
Behind him, the chalk’s final screech still hung in the mist, clinging like breath on glass. [659]  
He didn’t know why he did this. [664]  
Didn’t know who he’d been before the junkyard, before the forgetting. [676]  
But the driftwood never lied. [680]  
And the chalk always led him back. [686]  
That was enough. [689]  
As twilight seeped into the garden, the prophet vanished into the haze, his footprints already softening behind him. [710]  
The fog reshaped itself into the silhouette of a rocking chair. [721]  
Then a swing set. [724]  
Then nothing at all. [728]  
Only the chalk remained, half-buried, humming faintly—the last echo of a man who remembered futures, but lived only in the sound of what slips away. [768]
