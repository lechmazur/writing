The loop pedal priest knelt in the dimensional anchor, a chamber suspended between folds of fractured time, where gravity whispered and silence clung like velvet moss. [18]
His cassock, stitched from frayed audio tape, hummed faintly with the ghosts of layered chants, each loop a vow he could no longer unmake. [35]
Before the possession completes, he must plumb the hollows beneath this unraveled stillness — not with tools, but through rhetorical devices: questions that spiral, metaphors that collapse, paradoxes that bloom like wounds. [64]
His only object, an artist’s palette smeared with one color — a deep, bruised indigo called “Assumption’s Veil” — rested on his lap, unused yet radiating latent meaning. [90]
He decorates with silence, not as absence, but as architecture: each pause a column, each withheld breath a vaulted ceiling holding up truths too heavy for speech. [120]
The air tasted of static and old incense, and the walls shimmered like heat mirages over desert stone — not solid, not void, but thresholds waiting to be misread. [151]
He began, voice low, threading syllogisms into the dark: “If silence is a canvas, then what brushstroke does fear leave? If stillness unravels, who holds the thread?” [186]
Each question echoed, not audibly, but spatially — warping the anchor’s geometry, bending corridors of potential into labyrinths of implication. [207]
The indigo on his palette pulsed once, a heartbeat synced to the slow possession creeping through the chamber’s substrate — a sentient void learning to wear his skin. [241]
He knew its hunger: not for flesh, but for certainty. It fed on unchallenged axioms, on the quiet lies we tell ourselves to sleep at night. [270]
His mission was not exorcism, but illumination — to reveal hidden assumptions by dismantling the language that shelters them. [292]
He rose, stepping toward the center vortex where time frayed into filaments of might-have-been and never-will. [311]
“Tell me,” he whispered, “if you own the silence between two thoughts, do you own the thinker?” [331]
The chamber shuddered. [333]
A chime, unheard but felt in the molars, vibrated through the anchor’s core. [347]
The possession faltered — not stopped, but hesitated, confused by the rhetorical trap: ownership implies boundary, and boundaries require definition, and definition requires assumption. [385]
He pressed on, voice now a scalpel wrapped in velvet: “Is stillness the absence of motion, or the exhaustion of possibility? If you possess me, do you inherit my doubts — or merely my syntax?” [432]
The indigo on his palette wept a single drop, falling not down, but sideways — into a fold of space that shouldn’t exist. [461]
Where it landed, a glyph flared — ancient, angular, meaning “unasked.” [474]
The priest smiled, muffled clarity settling over him like a second skin. [486]
He understood now: the possession wasn’t invading — it was answering. [500]
It had mistaken his rhetorical excavations for invitations, his deconstructions for doorways. [517]
It sought not to consume, but to complete — to fill the hollows he’d carved with his own relentless questioning. [542]
He knelt again, palette in hand, and finally dipped his thumb into the indigo. [560]
With one slow stroke, he painted a question mark on the floor — not in pigment, but in negation, in anti-sound, in the grammar of silence. [592]
The mark glowed, then inverted — becoming not a symbol, but a suction, pulling the possession inward, not into him, but into the question itself. [624]
“What if,” he murmured, “the assumption you hunger for… is that you’re the only one asking?” [652]
The chamber screamed without sound. [656]
Walls peeled back like parchment. [659]
Time hiccuped. [661]
The possession unraveled — not destroyed, but dispersed — into the very stillness it had sought to dominate. [685]
The loop pedal priest sat alone again, the palette now empty, the silence deeper, richer, no longer a weapon but a cathedral. [712]
He closed his eyes, listening — not for echoes, but for the spaces between them, where new assumptions might quietly root. [740]
Before the next possession stirs, he will be ready — not with answers, but with better questions, painted in silence, plumb lines dropped into the dark through the only method that ever worked: the careful, cruel, clarifying art of rhetoric. [770]
