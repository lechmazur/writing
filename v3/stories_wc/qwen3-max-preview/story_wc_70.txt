The toll keeper, Elias, never lied—not because he was noble, but because his tongue refused to curl around falsehoods; truth spilled out of him like sap from a tapped maple. [18]
He manned the base of the Lightning Collection Tower, a skeletal spire jutting above the salt marshes, its copper veins still humming faintly despite the city-wide blackout that had silenced every bulb and screen three nights prior. [48]
Tourists still came, drawn by the rumor that the tower, though offline, still crackled with residual wonder—and Elias, ever candid, never dissuaded them. [69]
He collected no coins, only stories, which he tucked into a small lacquer box beside his stool, its surface etched with hummingbees frozen mid-flight. [90]
Inside that box lay not coins or notes, but matchboxes—each one containing a single cryptic riddle scrawled on rice paper, left behind by travelers who’d glimpsed something inexplicable near the tower’s apex. [122]
Elias preserved them not for profit, but to preserve wonder in routine—to remind himself, and anyone who paused long enough to ask, that magic hadn’t fled the world, merely gone quiet. [160]
Then came the woman in the waxed coat, her boots flecked with pollen, her eyes scanning the tower like a cartographer mapping ghosts. [182]
“You’re the keeper,” she stated, not asked. [189]
“I am,” Elias replied, involuntarily truthful even when silence would’ve served him better. [204]
She didn’t pay. [207]
Instead, she placed a matchbox on his counter—this one heavier, its label peeled back to reveal a riddle written not in ink, but in what looked like crystallized nectar: What hums when the swarm sleeps, yet never sings? [251]
Elias knew immediately. [254]
He’d seen the drone beehive failure on the newsfeeds before the blackout—how the automated apiaries that pollinated half the city’s vertical farms had collapsed overnight, their mechanical queens falling silent, their synthetic drones grounding mid-flight like dead leaves. [300]
The riddle wasn’t metaphor. [304]
It was a report. [307]
He opened the lacquer box, selected a matchbox marked with a lightning glyph, and handed it to her. [324]
Inside: When the sky forgets its song, the tower remembers. [340]
She read it, blinked, then whispered, “They’re still active.” [353]
Elias nodded. [355]
“They never stopped,” he said. [359]
“Even after the grid died?” [364]
“Especially after,” he replied. [369]
He rose, gestured toward the service ladder coiled around the tower’s spine. [380]
She followed, silent now, her earlier urgency tempered by awe. [392]
At the third platform, they found them—dozens of drone bees, no larger than thimbles, clinging to the tower’s copper struts, their wings stilled, their photoreceptors dim. [424]
But their abdomens pulsed with stored charge, faint blue flickers syncing with the distant rumble of thunderheads gathering over the bay. [455]
“They’re not broken,” Elias murmured. [460]
“They’re waiting.” [463]
The woman knelt, gently lifting one drone. [469]
Its shell vibrated against her palm—not with mechanical whir, but with harmonic resonance, tuned to the same frequency the tower used to siphon atmospheric electricity. [506]
“They’re not pollinators anymore,” she realized aloud. [515]
“They’re capacitors.” [519]
Elias smiled. [521]
The city thought the blackout was an end. [528]
He knew it was an adaptation. [534]
The drone beehives hadn’t failed—they’d evolved, migrating to the only structure still drinking lightning, storing it in their bodies like living batteries. [567]
“They’ll fly again,” he said, “when the storm breaks.” [581]
The woman turned to him, her expression softening from urgency to reverence. [594]
“You knew.” [597]
“I guessed,” Elias admitted. [601]
“But you didn’t tell anyone.” [606]
“No,” he said. [609]
“Why?” [611]
He opened the lacquer box, withdrew another matchbox—the one she’d given him—and placed it back in her hand. [630]
“Wonder,” he said, “isn’t meant to be explained. [638]
It’s meant to be revealed—slowly, strangely, like lightning finding its path.” [654]
She pocketed the box, then reached into her coat and pulled out a second lacquer box, identical to his, its bee-etchings worn smooth by time. [683]
“My grandfather made these,” she said. [689]
“He was the tower’s first keeper.” [695]
Elias stared. [697]
She placed it beside his. [701]
“Then you already know,” he said. [707]
She nodded. [709]
“The tower doesn’t collect lightning.” [714]
“It collects belief.” [718]
And in the nectar dusk, as the first fat drops of rain kissed the copper spire, the drones began to hum. [730]
