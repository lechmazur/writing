The druid stood at the edge of the cursed lake, her cloak woven from thorn-vines and silence, her eyes unreadable as obsidian mirrors. [17]
She had come after the magic trick failed—the one where the lake’s surface should have parted like silk, revealing the orchard vortex beneath. [36]
Instead, it had cracked like brittle glass, and swallowed the conjurer whole. [45]
Now, only she remained, the one who finds lost things—not trinkets or runaway pets, but truths buried beneath lies, memories drowned in denial. [67]
Her fingers brushed the pouch at her belt, where the flesh-eating plant seed pulsed faintly, hungry and ancient, whispering promises of revelation through teeth. [89]
She did not fear it. [92]
She feared what it might show her. [98]
The lake’s surface churned now, not with water, but with inverted branches and frozen blossoms spiraling downward into a vortex—an orchard caught in eternal cyclone, its roots clawing at the sky. [125]
This was the heart of the curse: a swirling orchard vortex where time bent but did not break, and confessions froze mid-breath, suspended like fruit too bitter to fall. [154]
She stepped onto the surface. [158]
It held. [160]
Beneath her boots, faces flickered in the ice—mouths open in silent screams, eyes wide with truths never spoken aloud. [179]
She walked toward the center, her guarded heart a fortress of moss and marrow, built to withstand the erosion of memory, the siege of regret. [204]
The seed stirred again. [208]
She knew its method: through expanding circles. [214]
It would not strike like lightning or ambush like shadow. [222]
It would bloom outward, slowly, patiently, each petal a question, each root a reckoning, until the center—the core of her resistance—had nowhere left to hide. [247]
She reached the vortex’s eye. [251]
Wind howled without sound, petals like shards of stained glass spiraling around her, each one a frozen confession torn from someone who dared to look inward too late. [280]
She knelt. [282]
Pressed her palm to the ice. [287]
Felt the seed awaken. [291]
It sprouted not with violence, but with inevitability—a green shoot piercing her skin, not to harm, but to anchor. [310]
Roots unfurled beneath her flesh, mapping veins, tracing scars, reading the runes of her sorrow like braille. [328]
She did not scream. [332]
She breathed. [334]
And as the roots spread, so did the circles—first around her wrist, then her arm, then her chest, each ring wider than the last, each one peeling back a layer of armor she’d forged in solitude. [367]
The orchard responded. [370]
Branches bent toward her, not to strike, but to witness. [379]
Petals drifted into her hair, melting against her temples, whispering names she’d buried, faces she’d erased. [398]
She saw the child she’d been, screaming into a mirror that reflected only obedience. [416]
She saw the lover she’d left, whose reflection never showed his trembling hands or the hollow behind his smile. [442]
She saw the enemy she’d slain, whose eyes in death held not hatred, but relief. [462]
Mirrors lie, she realized. [466]
They show surfaces polished for survival, not souls stripped raw for truth. [481]
The seed’s purpose was not destruction. [487]
It was unbending. [490]
Not the unbending of iron, rigid and brittle, but of willow after storm—slow, aching, inevitable return to true shape. [512]
She felt her ribs crack—not with pain, but release—as the final circle reached her heart, and the last lock fell open. [535]
The vortex stilled. [538]
The frozen confessions began to thaw. [543]
Voices rose—not screams, but songs, soft and warlike in their serenity, hymns of warriors who’d laid down arms not in defeat, but in understanding. [574]
The orchard bloomed upward, roots becoming branches, blossoms becoming stars. [585]
The lake drained into sky. [589]
She rose, barefoot on air, the seed now a crown of thorns and petals fused to her brow, its hunger sated—not by flesh, but by truth. [618]
She was no longer guarded. [623]
She was revealed. [626]
And in that revelation, she found what mirrors don’t show: not the face you wear, but the face you are when no one—including yourself—is watching. [663]
The vortex collapsed into a single point of light. [671]
She caught it. [674]
It warmed her palm. [677]
Then she turned, and walked back across the now-still lake, toward the world that had forgotten how to confess. [700]
Behind her, the orchard’s echo lingered—not as curse, but as compass. [713]
She would return. [716]
Not to hide. [719]
Not to fight. [722]
But to unbend others, through expanding circles, one frozen confession at a time. [738]
Warlike serenity settled in her bones—not the absence of battle, but the presence of peace forged in its aftermath. [766]
The lost would find her. [770]
