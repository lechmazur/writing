The mirror maker knelt in the ruined orchard district, where gnarled apple trees stood like petrified sentinels beneath centuries of thick fog that never lifted, not even for birdsong or sunbeams. [25]
Her hands, calloused from grinding silver-backed glass, trembled not from cold but from the weight of her task: to capture a runaway dream that had slipped through the cracks of sleep and nested in the fog’s hollows. [56]
Beside her lay the astronomer’s broken sextant, its brass limbs bent, its calibrated arcs fractured — a relic from a man who once charted stars but now charted only regrets. [87]
She had traded three flawless convex mirrors for it, knowing its brokenness held the key: not to celestial navigation, but to erasing boundaries between what sleeps and what wakes, what is lost and what might be found. [127]
The mirror maker was firmly grounded — not in denial of magic, but in reverence for its cost. [144]
She understood that dreams, like glass, reflect only when properly angled, and shatter when mishandled. [165]
Her workshop, long abandoned in the orchard’s heart, smelled of rust, wet bark, and ozone — the scent of thresholds thinning. [188]
Upon the shimmer of twilight frost, when the fog turned opalescent and the air crystallized with suspended breath, she began. [212]
She laid the sextant’s fragments in a circle around her, aligning them not by celestial degrees but by the rhythm of her own pulse. [239]
Then, she closed her eyes and initiated the method: through synchronized breathing — inhaling for seven counts, holding for three, exhaling for eleven — matching the cadence of the dream’s last known frequency, whispered to her by a sleepwalker who’d glimpsed its tail flickering behind the fog. [293]
With each exhale, the frost on the grass pulsed faintly, glowing blue at the edges. [311]
With each inhale, the broken sextant’s shards vibrated, whispering metallic sighs. [329]
She did not chant. [332]
She did not plead. [335]
She breathed — and in that breath, the mirror maker became the medium through which reality softened. [355]
The fog responded, thinning in concentric rings above her, revealing for the first time in centuries the bruised violet sky of true twilight. [384]
Glass mountains — that was the tone she carried in her marrow, sharp and luminous, refracting truth into facets too brilliant to behold directly. [413]
Her mirrors had always been more than surfaces; they were thresholds, invitations, traps. [428]
This one, she knew, would be her final craft. [440]
Not because she would die, but because after this, no dream would dare flee from her again. [461]
The runaway dream — a silver-scaled thing with eyes like molten mercury and wings of folded parchment — stirred in the upper fog, drawn by the sextant’s harmonic resonance. [492]
It had escaped from a child’s nightmare-turned-wish, fleeing the weight of expectation, the cage of becoming. [515]
The mirror maker understood. [518]
She had once been that child. [523]
Her breath deepened. [526]
The sextant shards levitated, rotating slowly, catching the twilight frost’s shimmer and casting prismatic shards onto the orchard floor. [550]
Where the light touched, apple blossoms — long thought extinct here — erupted in silent bursts of white and pink, their petals edged with frost-glow. [580]
The dream descended, not in fear, but in curiosity, alighting on the rim of the largest sextant fragment. [605]
The mirror maker opened her eyes. [610]
She did not reach. [613]
She exhaled — long, slow, deliberate — and the dream leaned into the warmth of her breath. [633]
In that moment, boundaries dissolved: between maker and made, between astronomer’s failure and artisan’s triumph, between fog and sky, between memory and mirror. [667]
She reached into her satchel and withdrew a blank disc of obsidian glass, polished to a void. [687]
With a final synchronized breath — inhale seven, hold three, exhale eleven — she pressed the glass against the dream’s shimmering flank. [712]
It did not resist. [715]
It flowed into the mirror like ink into water, swirling, settling, becoming. [730]
The mirror maker stood, cradling the completed piece. [737]
The fog thickened again. [740]
