The folklorist’s fingers brushed the fairy ring mushroom’s cap, damp with brine and memory, as she knelt in the sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks. [14]  
Glass panes, half-buried in silt and coral, still refracted the weak undersea light into fractured rainbows across her oilskin coat. [32]  
She was chronically curious — not the armchair sort, but the boots-muddy, notebook-stained, salt-in-the-eyelashes kind. [53]  
Decades later, the ache still lived beneath her ribs: not grief, but vacancy — memories stolen not by time, but by something older, hungrier. [79]  
The greenhouse had once floated above waves, a Victorian folly anchored to commerce; now it slumbered in kelp and rust, a cathedral of lost seasons. [109]  
Shipwrecks circled it like iron sentinels — trawlers, schooners, even a steam yacht — all lured too close by the orchard’s unnatural bloom, then swallowed. [141]  
Local fisherfolk whispered of lights in the deep, of fruit that glowed and vanished, of voices singing in languages no human throat could shape. [176]  
She’d dismissed them — once. [180]  
Until the dreams began: not images, but absences — hollows where laughter should echo, silences where hands should clasp. [205]  
Her motivation was surgical: not to mourn, but to recover. [214]  
To stitch back the stolen moments — her mother’s lullaby, her brother’s last wave, the taste of peaches warm from the branch. [240]  
The fairy ring mushroom was her first tangible clue — unearthed near the greenhouse’s central pedestal, glowing faintly at midnight. [266]  
Folklore named it a threshold, a hinge between worlds. [276]  
She theorized it fed on memory — or rather, on the emotional resonance left behind when memory is ripped away. [305]  
To detect the mechanism of theft, she turned her gaze upward — not to the surface, but to the heavens visible through broken panes. [333]  
By studying broken constellations — those warped by the greenhouse’s curved, algae-flecked glass — she mapped distortions in perceived time. [360]  
Each warped star-path corresponded to a local disappearance. [371]  
Each bent beam, a life unlived. [378]  
The greenhouse didn’t just sit among wrecks — it caused them. [390]  
It pulled vessels inward when habits break: when captains deviate from routine, when lovers argue at the helm, when children stop believing in bedtime stories. [428]  
In those fragile instants of rupture, the orchard wakes. [438]  
It offers beauty — luminous apples, singing blossoms — and takes in exchange the memories that anchor souls to their lives. [470]  
The folklorist spent months charting stellar aberrations against ship logs, survivor testimonies, tidal records. [491]  
She cross-referenced lunar phases with local amnesiacs’ episodes. [502]  
Her notebooks swelled with equations scribbled beside pressed petals and salt-crusted sketches of spectral orchard keepers. [526]  
The breakthrough came not from data, but from instinct — a chronically curious hunch. [544]  
She placed the fairy ring mushroom beneath the most distorted skylight, where Ursa Major’s tail bent into a question mark. [575]  
At the precise moment a fishing trawler above broke its decades-old route — veering to avoid a storm — the mushroom pulsed. [609]  
A low hum vibrated through the greenhouse’s iron bones. [620]  
Glass chimed like struck crystal. [626]  
And the air thickened with scent: her mother’s rosewater, her brother’s pipe smoke, the sticky-sweet juice of sun-warmed peaches. [658]  
Memories didn’t flood back — they seeped, like groundwater through cracked stone. [675]  
Fragments. [677]  
Feelings before faces. [681]  
Warmth before names. [685]  
She understood then: the orchard didn’t steal to hoard — it stole to survive. [701]  
It fed on emotional rupture, the sharper the better. [711]  
Her own decades of absence had starved it — until her return, her relentless curiosity, her refusal to forget. [737]  
She could leave — surface, publish, warn the coast. [748]  
Or she could stay, and let the orchard take the rest. [761]  
She smiled, brushing soil from her knees. [767]  
Curiosity, after all, was her oldest habit. [770]
