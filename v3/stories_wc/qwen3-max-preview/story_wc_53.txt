The kinetic lagoon above the clouds had stilled at last, its once-whirling carousel of floating islands locked in eerie suspension, like breath caught mid-sigh. [18]
I am the resolute scavenger who walks its silent rim, boots crunching on salt-crusted planks that remember music but now echo only with wind. [37]
My motivation is simple, though it fractures me daily: I must negotiate with my own ghost — the version of me who believed ambition could outpace gravity. [59]
She haunts the carousel’s central spire, flickering in and out like faulty neon, always just beyond reach, always whispering what I used to want. [80]
I am chronologically confused — not by magic or malfunction, but because time here doesn’t flow; it pools, eddies, repeats, and sometimes skips like a scratched record. [104]
I remember planting a garden on Island Seven; I also remember never arriving there. [117]
I recall kissing someone under twin moons; I also recall being alone since the ascent. [132]
The contradiction doesn’t trouble me — it’s the only map I have left. [145]
What anchors me is the disposable camera wheel I found lodged in the ribs of a rusted calliope — a relic from Before, when tourists snapped joy instead of scavengers hoarded regret. [175]
Its film is long expired, its flash corroded, yet I wind it manually, click by click, as I wander, capturing nothing visible but hoping to trap echoes. [201]
I collect fragments of overheard stories — not from living mouths, but from the lagoon’s residue: whispers trapped in glass beads, sighs fossilized in coral dust, laughter calcified in abandoned ticket stubs. [237]
Each fragment is a shard of someone else’s dream, and I press them into my journal like pressed flowers, convinced they’ll help me speak the ghost’s language. [267]
She doesn’t speak in words, you see — she speaks in gestures I used to make: the way I’d tuck my hair behind my ear when nervous, or how I’d tap my foot when plotting escape. [302]
Yesterday, I found a child’s voice singing a lullaby inside a cracked teacup — it belonged to a mother who jumped when the music stopped, hoping her fall would restart the world. [338]
I added it to my collection, wound the camera, and whispered to the ghost: “Is this what you wanted? To be remembered as someone who leapt?” [367]
She flickered, reached for me — not to touch, but to correct. [379]
Her fingers mimed adjusting a lens. [385]
I understood: she wanted me to stop collecting other ghosts and start developing my own. [408]
Regret is my constant companion — not the sharp kind that cuts, but the dull, heavy kind that settles in your joints and makes every step an apology. [436]
I regret trusting the carnival barker who sold tickets to “eternal ascent.” [450]
I regret not asking the woman beside me on the gondola what she was running from. [470]
Most of all, I regret believing that ambition was a ladder, not a carousel — that if I climbed high enough, I’d break through to somewhere real. [501]
The lagoon knows better. [505]
It shows me daily: all heights are illusions when you’re spinning in place. [521]
The camera wheel clicks again — thirty-seventh exposure. [531]
I don’t know if film can capture ghosts, but I keep winding, keep walking, keep listening. [548]
Tonight, as the twin moons rise — one silver, one bruised purple — I climb to the central spire, journal in one hand, camera in the other. [573]
The ghost is waiting, clearer than ever, her edges no longer frayed by haste. [588]
She holds out her palm. [593]
Not for a truce. [596]
Not for forgiveness. [599]
But for the camera. [603]
I give it to her. [607]
She lifts it, aims it at me, and presses the shutter. [617]
A flash — weak, sputtering — bursts like a dying star. [627]
In that fractured stillness, I hear her voice for the first time: “Develop this.” [642]
I take the camera back, fingers trembling, and wind to the final frame. [658]
There’s no film left. [663]
No pictures to develop. [667]
Only silence, thick as cloud. [672]
And then — a click from within the spire. [679]
A drawer opens. [682]
Inside: a single envelope, yellowed, stamped with my own handwriting, addressed to me. [694]
I open it. [697]
One sentence: “You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it.” [715]
The ghost smiles — not at me, but through me — and dissolves into moonlight. [731]
I sit down, legs dangling over the edge of the world, and for the first time in years, I do not regret. [751]
