The diminutive titan knelt in the dust of the ancient temple library lost in time, her scaled fingers brushing cracked marble as constellations outside the shattered dome paused mid-drift. [18]  
She was regally unpretentious—not by choice, but by the cruel arithmetic of exile: crownless, voiceless, yet never powerless. [33]  
Her mission burned colder than the stars: to unmask a pretender to the throne who wore her brother’s face and ruled her people with velvet tyranny. [54]  
No army would follow her now; no herald would trumpet her return. [65]  
Instead, she wielded cryptic messages left in library books—fragile, forgotten tomes whose pages whispered rebellion to those who dared to listen. [84]  
Each message was a rune of drift, carved not in stone but in implication, guiding the disillusioned through labyrinths of metaphor toward truth’s sharp edge. [106]  
She had learned patience in the silence between falling stars, and now, across the pause of shifting constellations, she moved like ink bleeding through parchment. [129]  
The iron gall ink pellet in her palm—small as a teardrop, dense as grief—was her final instrument. [144]  
It would sunder the pretender’s illusion, not with fire or blade, but with revelation: a single drop, dissolved in the sacred font beneath the throne, would stain his skin with the truth of his stolen bloodline. [177]  
She slipped through vaulted halls where dust motes danced in starlight older than kingdoms, her footfalls swallowed by centuries of silence. [198]  
Books lined the walls like tombstones, each spine a silent sentinel; she chose none, yet left traces in all—folded corners, marginalia in cipher, phrases rearranged to point like arrows toward the pretender’s lies. [231]  
Scholars would find them. Rebels would decode them. The rune of drift would carry her will like pollen on the wind. [251]  
In the Celestial Alcove, where the pretender’s coronation scroll lay displayed under glass, she placed her final message—not a threat, but a riddle wrapped in a lullaby. [277]  
“Who wears the face but not the fate? Whose shadow drinks the light?” [291]  
Beneath it, she tucked the iron gall ink pellet, wrapped in vellum inscribed with the royal sigil—the one only she and her slain brother knew how to forge. [319]  
She did not linger. [322]  
The temple library exhaled around her, its stones remembering her passage like a sigh. [336]  
Days bled into weeks. [339]  
A librarian, eyes sharp with suspicion, found the riddle. [347]  
A scribe, heart heavy with doubt, traced the sigil. [357]  
A general, weary of hollow victories, followed the trail of runes hidden in herbals, star charts, and love poems. [381]  
They converged—not as conspirators, but as witnesses drawn by gravity’s quiet pull. [397]  
On the night the constellations resumed their march, the pretender stood before the font to renew his oath, unaware the water shimmered with dissolved iron gall. [428]  
As he dipped his hands, the ink reacted—not with stain, but with memory: his skin glowed with ancestral sigils that were not his own, revealing him as a usurper stitched from stolen flesh and borrowed names. [469]  
Gasps became shouts; shouts became silence. [475]  
The rune of drift had done its work—not by force, but by erosion, the graceful collapse of a lie too heavy to stand. [500]  
The diminutive titan watched from the gallery, hooded, unseen. [508]  
She felt no triumph—only the hollow echo of justice delayed too long. [520]  
When they called for her, she did not descend immediately. [528]  
She let them kneel in the ruins of their certainty. [537]  
Let them taste the bitterness of their blindness. [544]  
Then, with steps as soft as settling ash, she emerged—not as a conqueror, but as a custodian of truth. [564]  
Her crown remained unworn; her throne, unclaimed. [572]  
She needed neither. [575]  
The pretender was dragged away, howling. [580]  
The people wept, not for him, but for themselves—for the years they bowed to a shadow. [600]  
She spoke only once: “Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror. You sundered yourselves by refusing to look.” [627]  
They begged her to rule. [631]  
She declined. [633]  
“I am the rune of drift,” she said. “I move where truth is forgotten, and leave before it is worshipped.” [657]  
That night, as the stars realigned and the temple sighed into deeper time, she vanished—leaving behind only an open book, its final page bearing a single line: “The crown is not worn. It is carried.” [698]  
And tucked into the binding, another iron gall ink pellet—just in case the next pretender forgot how fragile lies truly are. [727]  
The library, older than memory, absorbed her absence as it had absorbed her presence: without fanfare, without grief, with the quiet grace of stone accepting moss. [765]
