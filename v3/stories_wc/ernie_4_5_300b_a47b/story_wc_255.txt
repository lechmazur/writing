In the glassblower's courtyard, where sunlight fractured through molten-glass orbs strung like lanterns, a colorblind painter named Elias traced the edges of a half-finished mural. [42] His canvases were always abstract—swirls of gray and beige that critics called "hauntingly empty"—but Elias saw vibrancy where others saw void. [65] After the phoenix had risen three summers prior, scorching the sky and reshaping the land, he’d lost his ability to perceive color, yet gained an obsession: to find beauty in imperfection, to paint what the world refused to show him. [110]

The courtyard’s owner, a wiry glassblower named Marla, tolerated his presence in exchange for sketches of her kiln’s flames. [133] Today, she tossed him a concertina reed tongue, its brass keys glinting like molten gold. [148] "Trade you for a plant arrangement," she said, nodding to the pots lining the courtyard’s stone walls. [166] "Something that’ll make the tourists gawk." [175]

Elias blinked. Marla’s bartered awakenings were infamous—she’d once traded a blown-glass heart for a fisherman’s tale of drowning. [196] "What’s the catch?" he asked, twirling the reed tongue. Its mechanism clicked like a cricket’s legs. [214]

"No catch," she said, grinning. "Just… prove you’re not as dull as your paintings." [229]

Innocently cunning, Elias accepted. He’d long suspected Marla’s trades held deeper magic, and the reed tongue hummed with a resonance he couldn’t ignore. [254] That night, he arranged ferns, ivy, and a single withered rose in a clay pot, positioning each leaf to catch the dawn light. [278] When Marla saw it, she laughed—a sound like shattering glass. "You call *this* art?" [294]

"Wait," Elias said. He pressed the reed tongue’s keys, and the plants shuddered. The ivy curled into a spiral; the rose’s petals unfurled, revealing a tiny, iridescent moth inside. [321] "They’re… communicating." [328]

Marla’s smile faded. "After the phoenix, the land’s full of secrets. Plants remember what we forget." [351] She tossed him a vial of cobalt dust. "Add this to your paints. It’ll show you what the reed tongue hears." [373]

Elias hesitated. The dust glittered like starlight, but he’d sworn off pigments after losing his sight. [390] Yet the moth now perched on his finger, its wings casting prismatic shadows. [406] "Why help me?" he asked. [412]

"Because you see the world sideways," Marla said. "And sideways is where the magic lives." [431]

He mixed the dust into his gray paint. When he brushed it onto the mural, the canvas erupted in hues he’d never named—crimson, cerulean, a thousand shades of green. [458] But the colors twisted, forming fractals that pulsed like a heartbeat. [473] The reed tongue’s keys grew warm in his hand, and the courtyard’s plants began to sway, their leaves rustling in a language he almost understood. [496]

"Awaken," the moth whispered, its voice a chorus of wind chimes. [507]

Elias’s head throbbed. The mural’s fractals shifted, revealing a scene: Marla as a girl, offering a blown-glass bird to a phoenix. The bird shattered, its shards embedding in the phoenix’s feathers, which burst into flames. [542] "You… caused the fire?" he gasped. [549]

Marla’s face hardened. "The phoenix was dying. Its fire needed fuel. I gave it imperfection—a flaw to burn brighter." [572] She pointed to the mural. "Now *you* see it." [581]

The reed tongue’s keys glowed. Elias pressed them, and the courtyard’s plants erupted into a symphony of light. The glass orbs overhead sang, their notes harmonizing with the rustling leaves. [604] Tourists gathered, murmuring as the mural’s colors bled into the air, painting the sky in streaks of gold and violet. [623]

"Beauty isn’t in perfection," Marla said, her voice soft. "It’s in the cracks, the flaws, the things that shouldn’t work but do." [646]

Elias smiled. His canvases would never be the same. [656] He traded the reed tongue back to Marla for a handful of cobalt dust, then began a new painting—a phoenix rising from a shattered glass bird, its wings woven from ivy and rose thorns. [685]

As the sun set, the moth landed on his shoulder. "You’ve awakened," it said. [698]

"No," Elias replied, dipping his brush in violet. "I’ve just started to see." [715]

The courtyard’s plants hummed in approval, their arrangement a testament to the beauty of broken things. [738] After the phoenix rose, the world had learned to burn brighter. So had Elias. [759]
