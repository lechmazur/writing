The lavender bluff shimmered under the aurora’s electric violet, its petals trembling like the wings of a thousand moths drawn to some celestial flame. [35] Kael Veyra, a luminous skeptic whose eyes flickered with the same restless energy as the northern lights, adjusted the tin compass ring on his thumb—a relic from a grandfather who’d sworn it could “sense the world’s heartbeat.” [68] He didn’t believe in heartbeats. Not anymore. Not since the forests began holding elections, their ancient trees voting on whether to bloom or wither, to shelter or abandon. [110] The compass, though, had started behaving oddly. Its needle spun not toward magnetic north, but toward people—*specific* people—as if mapping some hidden current beneath their skin. [149]

Kael’s motivation was simple: to learn why some people carried weather with them. Why his neighbor, Lira, could walk into a room and make the air humid with the scent of impending rain, or why the blacksmith’s forge always flared brighter when Old Marlow passed by. [197] The compass, he’d theorized, was an emergent tool—a device that evolved beyond its original purpose, its needle now a conduit for something terrestrially cosmic, a bridge between the earthly and the unseen. [243] But to confirm this, he needed to *converge* with the source. To stand where the aurora’s light and the bluff’s lavender met, where the forests’ elections echoed in the soil, and taste the air for changes. [289]

Sensing through taste changes was a method Kael had developed after years of documenting anomalies. When the compass pointed to Lira, his mouth filled with the metallic tang of ozone, sharp and electric. When it pointed to Marlow, he tasted soot and iron, as if swallowing the forge’s breath. [344] Tonight, the needle trembled toward the bluff’s edge, where the lavender thickened into a wall of purple, and the aurora’s glow painted the ground in liquid light. [378] Kael knelt, pressing his palm to the soil. The compass ring grew warm, its tin surface humming like a struck gong. [405]

He closed his eyes and waited. The first taste was lavender—sweet, floral, expected. Then it shifted: a burst of salt, like ocean spray, followed by the bitter, earthy undertone of decaying leaves. [449] The compass needle spun faster, now pointing not at a person, but at the bluff itself. Kael’s throat tightened. The forests’ elections were happening tonight. Had the compass detected the collective will of the trees? [487]

A low rumble shook the ground. The lavender stems bent as if bowing, and the aurora above fractured into a thousand jagged streaks. [517] Kael’s mouth flooded with a new flavor: copper, sharp and raw, like blood. He spat, coughing, and stumbled back. The compass ring slipped from his thumb, clattering to the soil. [553]

“You shouldn’t have come here,” a voice said. [560]

Lira stood at the edge of the bluff, her silhouette framed by the aurora. Her presence altered the air—the humidity thickened, and Kael’s skin prickled as if a storm were brewing. [596] She knelt beside him, her fingers brushing the compass. “It’s not just people who carry weather,” she said. “Places do too. Especially places like this.” [634]

Kael frowned. “The forests’ elections—they’re not just about blooming or withering, are they?” [653]

Lira shook her head. “They’re about balance. The trees vote on whether to absorb the world’s pain or release it. Tonight, they’re releasing.” She gestured to the compass. “Your ring isn’t just sensing people. It’s sensing *moments*. When the world shifts, it points to the epicenter.” [708]

Kael stared at the tin ring, now still, its needle frozen in place. The copper taste in his mouth faded, replaced by something softer: lavender and regret. [740] He’d spent years dismissing the unexplainable, yet here it was—terrestrially cosmic, woven into the soil and the sky and the choices of ancient trees. [778]

The aurora dimmed, and the bluff fell silent. The forests’ election had concluded. For now, the world held its breath. [780]
