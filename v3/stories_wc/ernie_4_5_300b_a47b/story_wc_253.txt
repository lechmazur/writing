The farmhouse stood shrouded in a pall of gray, its wooden planks weathered to the color of old bone. [18] Behind it, three giant wind turbines loomed, their blades slicing the sky into fractured shards of light. [31] Inside, Lirael, a blank-faced performer with eyes like polished stone, sat at the kitchen table, a dried flower bouquet clutched in her hands. [50] The petals crumbled at her touch, scattering like ash. [56]

After the happiness mandate, the world had become a place of forced smiles and hollow laughter. [69] The government decreed that grief was a contagion, to be stamped out with mandatory therapy sessions and brightly colored posters proclaiming, “Joy is a Choice!” [94] Lirael, once a puppeteer in a traveling troupe, had lost her family to the mandate’s enforcement teams—her mother’s tears deemed “unhealthy,” her father’s silence labeled “rebellion.” [127] Now, she performed in the farmhouse, her face a mask of indifference, her movements precise and empty. [145]

She placed the bouquet on the table, its stems bound by a frayed ribbon. [155] The flowers had been her mother’s favorite—sunflowers, now reduced to brittle husks. [167] Lirael reached for a pocketknife, its blade dulled by years of use, and began to whittle a block of wood. [185] The wood was scrap from the turbines’ maintenance crews, discarded and worthless. [197] She worked methodically, her hands steady, her expression unchanged. [208]

“Today,” she said, her voice flat and monotone, “I will carve a spoon.” [221] She held up the wood, examining it as if it were a script. [229] “First, I must find the grain.” [235] She turned the block, tracing invisible lines with her fingertip. [244] “The grain is the wood’s memory, its history.” [253] Her knife bit into the surface, sending thin curls of wood spiraling to the floor. [266]

The farmhouse creaked in the wind, the turbines humming a low, droning song. [277] Lirael’s performance was morally ambiguous—a rebellion against the mandate, yet a surrender to its demands. [293] She dramatized the mundane, turning a simple task into a ritual, a way to honor the past without succumbing to despair. [313]

“Now,” she continued, “I shape the bowl.” [322] Her knife moved in smooth, deliberate strokes, each cut a calculated gesture. [334] “The bowl must be deep enough to hold soup, but shallow enough to see the bottom.” [350] She paused, holding the spoon’s rough form to the light. [359] “A balance between emptiness and fullness.” [368]

Outside, the turbines’ shadows stretched across the fields, swallowing the last rays of sunlight. [383] Lirael’s mother had once said that the turbines were like giants, stealing the wind’s voice. [399] Now, they were just machines, their purpose stripped of meaning by the mandate. [414]

“Next,” Lirael said, “I smooth the edges.” [423] She pulled a strip of sandpaper from her pocket, running it along the spoon’s curves. [436] “Smoothness is a lie, of course. Even the smoothest surface has ridges, imperfections.” [452] Her hands moved with practiced ease, the sandpaper’s grit a counterpoint to the turbines’ whine. [469]

She thought of her father, a woodworker who had believed in the beauty of flaws. [482] “A crack in a table,” he’d say, “is a story waiting to be told.” [495] The enforcement teams had taken him away for that, for daring to suggest that imperfection was human. [512]

“Finally,” Lirael said, “I polish the wood.” [521] She dabbed a cloth with oil, rubbing it into the spoon until it gleamed. [534] “Polishing is an act of defiance. It says, ‘I see you, flaws and all, and I choose to make you beautiful.’” [556] She held the spoon up, admiring its sheen. [564]

The dried flowers rustled in the breeze from the open window. [573] Lirael reached out, touching a petal. It disintegrated, leaving a faint stain on her fingertips. [586] “Grief is like these flowers,” she said. “You can’t preserve it, not really. But you can remake it, give it new shape.” [608]

She placed the spoon on the table, next to the bouquet. [617] The remade hush of the farmhouse settled around her, a silence thick with unspoken words. [634] The turbines continued to turn, their blades a blur in the twilight. [645]

Lirael stood, her performance over for the day. [654] She walked to the window, looking out at the fields. [662] The mandate had taken so much, but it couldn’t take this—the quiet act of creation, the refusal to let grief be erased. [684]

She picked up the dried bouquet, holding it to her nose as if she could still smell the sunflowers. [699] “Lightness,” she whispered, “is not the absence of darkness. It’s the courage to carry both.” [718]

The turbines’ shadows lengthened, merging with the coming night. [729] Lirael returned to the table, her blank face a mask of resolve. [742] She picked up the spoon, turning it in her hands. [750] Tomorrow, she would carve another. [757] And the day after that, another still. [765]

In the emotional void left by the mandate, she would cultivate lightness, one whittle at a time. [770]
