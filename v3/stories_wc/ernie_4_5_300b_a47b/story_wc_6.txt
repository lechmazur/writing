The obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes shimmered like a broken mirror, its surface dotted with the skeletal remains of drowned kelp. [24] Lira stood at the edge, her boots sinking into the damp sand, and watched the clouds migrate overhead—a slow, gray parade that blurred the line between sky and sea. [46] She was the arsonist’s daughter, though the title clung to her like a second skin, its edges frayed by years of smothering guilt. [70] Today, she’d come to graft new roots into the scarred earth, to prove that scars could sing if you listened close enough. [93]

In her pocket, a foreign coin—a relic from her mother’s last trip abroad—pressed against her thigh. [112] Lira had drilled a hole through its center and strung it on red thread, a makeshift pendant that jingled like a warning. [132] The coin’s edges were worn smooth, its face etched with symbols she didn’t recognize, but its weight in her hand anchored her. [154] She’d inherited her father’s restlessness but channeled it into firefighting, a career that let her outrun the flames he’d once fed. [177]

The lagoon’s water was black, fed by an underground river that carried volcanic sand from the northern beaches. [196] Lira knelt and scooped a handful, letting the grains slip through her fingers. [211] The sand hissed like a secret, its particles glinting faintly in the dim light. [227] She’d read that volcanic soil was fertile, that it could coax life from ash. [244] Maybe the same was true for people. [250]

A shout echoed from the dunes. Lira turned, gracefully alert, her firefighter’s instincts humming. [269] Three figures stumbled toward her, their silhouettes warped by the shifting clouds. [285] The first was a child, no older than seven, clutching a seabird with a broken wing. [302] Behind her, a woman and a man argued in hushed tones, their voices frayed. [319]

“She won’t let go,” the woman said, nodding at the girl. [332] “Says it’s her only friend.” [340]

Lira crouched, her knees sinking into the sand. [349] The girl’s eyes were wide, her cheeks streaked with salt and tears. [363] “What’s her name?” Lira asked, extending a hand. [373]

“Mara,” the girl whispered. [379]

“Mara,” Lira repeated, softening her tone. [387] “Let me see her wing.” [393]

The child hesitated, then placed the bird in Lira’s palms. [402] Its heartbeat fluttered against her skin, a fragile rhythm. [413] Lira examined the wing, noting the clean break. [421] “I can fix this,” she said, “but it’ll hurt. Are you brave enough?” [436]

Mara nodded, her jaw set. [442] Lira fished the coin from her pocket and looped the red thread around the bird’s leg. [459] “This’ll keep her safe,” she lied, though the coin’s jingle did seem to calm the creature. [478]

As she splinted the wing with a strip of kelp, the man spoke up. [490] “You’re the firefighter,” he said, not unkindly. “The one who… you know.” [507]

Lira didn’t look up. “Yes.” [513]

“Your father…” He trailed off. [519]

“Died in a fire he started,” Lira finished, her voice steady. [532] “But I’m not him.” [538]

The lagoon lapped at the shore, its rhythm steady as a heartbeat. [551] The clouds continued their migration, casting the world in brief, fleeting light. [568] When Lira finished, she handed Mara the bird. [577] “She’ll fly again,” she said. “But only if you let her go.” [592]

Mara’s lower lip trembled. [597] “What if she forgets me?” [603]

“Scars don’t forget,” Lira said, touching the coin. “They just learn to sing.” [620]

The girl released the bird, and it stumbled into the air, its wings beating weakly at first, then stronger. [639] It soared over the lagoon, disappearing into the migrating clouds. [654] Mara laughed, a sound like wind chimes, and Lira felt something loosen in her chest. [673]

Later, as the group trudged back to the village, Lira stayed behind. [688] She opened her palm, revealing a single grain of black sand. [700] It glinted in the fading light, a tiny, unyielding spark. [715] She let it fall, watching it vanish into the lagoon. [728]

Compassion, she thought, wasn’t about erasing the past. [739] It was about carrying the weight of it, gracefully alert, and turning it into something that could grow. [762] The lagoon, the sand, the coin—all were scars. [773] And all of them sang. [780]
