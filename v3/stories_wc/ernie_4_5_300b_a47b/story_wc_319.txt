The frozen garden slept under a blanket of mist, its statues coated in rime like ancient ghosts. [20] Mara, the feral library guardian, crouched behind a topiary hedgehog, her claws digging into the ice-crusted soil. [38] She’d been waiting here through the veil of sleep—that liminal hour when the world blurred between waking and dreaming—for the cultist to return. [62] Her dimensionally homesick heart ached for the shifting corridors of her true home, a labyrinthine library that existed between planes, but she’d sworn an oath to guard this fragile slice of reality. [92]  

The cultist’s pendant glinted in her mind’s eye, a twisted silver key etched with symbols that pulsed like a second heartbeat. [112] She’d stolen it weeks ago, luring the fool into the garden with a forged invitation to a “ritual of clarity.” [129] Now, as frost crystals hummed in the air, she practiced interiorizing exteriors—a technique her mentor had taught her to bend reality by focusing inward. [155] The mist thickened, swallowing sound, until the garden felt less like a place and more like a thought. [170]  

A shadow stirred near the fountain. [176] Mara’s ears twitched. The cultist emerged, draped in a tattered cloak that shed mist like a snakeskin. [193] He carried a lantern, its flame blue and smokeless, casting no light but revealing hidden things. [212] “You think to outwit the Veil-Walkers?” he hissed, not looking at her. “The boundaries of light are not so easily breached.” [236]  

Mara didn’t move. Waiting was her art. [246] She let the silence stretch, let the mist seep into her lungs until her breath matched its rhythm. [263] The cultist’s pendant burned in her pocket, its edges digging into her thigh. [276] She’d promised herself she’d return it to the library’s vaults, where it couldn’t harm anyone. But first, she needed to understand why it called to her—why its symbols mirrored the ones etched into the walls of her childhood home. [308]  

“You’re not like the others,” the cultist said, finally turning. His eyes were voids, but his voice trembled. [326] “You don’t fear the dark. You… invite it.” [337]  

Mara stepped forward, ice cracking beneath her bare feet. [346] The garden seemed to hold its breath. [352] “I fear the light,” she said, her voice rough from disuse. “The way it sharpens edges. Makes things… final.” [370] She reached into her pocket, fingers closing around the pendant. [380] “But uncertainty—that’s where we live. Isn’t it?” [392]  

The cultist’s lantern flickered. [397] For a heartbeat, the mist parted, revealing a path of glowing moss leading to the library’s hidden door. [415] Mara’s chest tightened. She’d seen this door only in dreams, its archway carved with the same symbols as the pendant. [432]  

“You want to make friends with uncertainty?” the cultist asked, stepping closer. [445] “Then give me the key. Let the boundaries dissolve.” [457]  

Mara hesitated. [460] The pendant grew warm, its symbols rearranging into a familiar pattern. [473] She thought of her mentor, who’d vanished into the library’s depths decades ago, leaving only a note: *“Trust the fog.”* [492]  

With a sigh, Mara tossed the pendant into the fountain. [502] It sank with a hiss, sending ripples through the ice. [514] The cultist screamed, clawing at the water as if drowning. [527] But Mara didn’t look. She focused on the moss path, now pulsing like a heartbeat. [544]  

“Wait,” the cultist gasped, collapsing to his knees. [553] “You don’t know what you’ve done.” [562]  

Mara smiled, a rare, genuine thing. [569] “I know exactly,” she said, and stepped onto the path. [582] The mist swallowed her whole.  

When she opened her eyes, she stood in the library’s central atrium, its shelves stretching into infinity. [600] The air smelled of old paper and ozone. [609] And there, at the far end, stood her mentor, holding a lantern identical to the cultist’s. [626]  

“You interiorized the exterior,” he said, not unkindly. “And found the threshold.” [643]  

Mara nodded, her dimensionally homesick heart finally still. [655] The boundaries of light weren’t walls—they were doors. And uncertainty? [670] That was just another word for home. [677]
