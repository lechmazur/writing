In the midnight glade above clouds, where the air tasted of ozone and old starlight, Elara unfastened the silver clasp of her onyx-ink satchel. [38] The glade was a floating island of moss and silver birch, its edges dissolving into the mist below. [52] She knelt, her cartomancer’s robes pooling like ink, and laid out her deck—tarot cards painted with constellations and forgotten myths. [73] Tonight, she sought not prophecy, but penance. [80]

Her hands trembled as she traced the cracks in the dolls’ tea set saucer she’d carried for years. [96] The saucer, a relic from her childhood, bore a hairline fracture that spiraled like a question mark. [111] She’d found it in the attic after her mother’s death, tucked beside a birthday tablecloth embroidered with generations of handprints. [129] The family custom had been to trace each member’s palm on the cloth every year, a ritual meant to bind time to flesh. [148] But Elara’s hands had never been traced—not after the birth, when her mother’s voice had gone silent mid-song. [166]

“Cloudbound repentance,” she whispered, the phrase tasting of ash and honey. [181] She’d read it in a grimoire, a description of souls who lingered above the earth to atone for sins they couldn’t name. [199] Her mother’s absence felt like such a sin: a hole in the world where love should’ve been. [217] Elara had become a cartomancer to map the cracks in time, to find where lost moments pooled like rain in a saucer. [235]

The glade shuddered as she laid the first card: *The Hanged Man*, upside-down, its feet dangling into the void. [252] “Willingly perplexed,” she murmured, a smile twisting her lips. [263] The card’s reflection in the saucer’s crack showed not a man, but a woman with Elara’s eyes, suspended between breaths. [281] She unfastened her robe’s sash, letting the fabric fall to reveal a linen shift printed with the same handprints from the birthday cloth. [300] The fabric was frayed at the edges, as if time itself had gnawed at it. [314]

A wind rose, carrying the scent of lilacs—her mother’s favorite flower. [327] Elara’s breath hitched. She traced her own palm on the shift, the ink from the cards staining her skin. [345] The saucer’s crack widened, a thin line of light seeping through. [356] She pressed her ear to the fissure and heard it: the hum of lost time, a chorus of unspoken words and unfinished hugs. [374]

“I’m here,” she said, though the words were swallowed by the mist. [387] The cards fluttered, rearranging into *The Star*, its waters flowing upward. [401] Elara’s fingers danced, unfastening the saucer’s crack with a thread of onyx ink. [415] The light burst forth, illuminating the glade’s heart—a tree whose roots coiled like hourglasses, each ring a year of her mother’s life. [433]

She climbed the tree, her shift snagging on bark. [444] At the top, she found a nest of birch twigs and broken china, the saucer nestled inside. [460] Below, the clouds parted, revealing a city of glass where time moved backward. [473] Her mother stood there, young and laughing, tracing a child’s hand on a tablecloth. [487] The child’s palm was Elara’s own, smaller, unmarked by grief. [498]

“You kept waiting,” her mother called, her voice echoing like a bell. [511] “But repentance isn’t a place. It’s a choice.” [522] Elara’s throat tightened. The saucer’s crack had healed, its question mark now a straight line. [539] She unfastened the final card—*The World*, its serpent eating its tail—and placed it in the nest. [556]

The glade shuddered again. The tree dissolved into starlight, and Elara fell, her shift billowing like a parachute. [574] She landed softly on the moss, the saucer whole in her hands. [585] The birthday cloth, now draped over her shoulders, bore a new handprint: her mother’s, traced in onyx ink. [603]

Elara laughed, the sound choking and bright. [612] She packed her cards, the saucer tucked safe in her satchel. [623] The glade was fading, but she didn’t mind. [632] She’d found where lost time accumulated—not in the clouds, but in the spaces between breaths, in the cracks we willingly perplex. [654]

As she stepped off the glade, the mist parted to show a path home. [667] Her mother’s voice followed, a whisper on the wind: “Trace your hands, little star. The clock’s always ticking, even when it’s broken.” [699]
