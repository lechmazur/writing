The aurora flickered over the ridgeway like a spectral hand, its colors bleeding through the twilight and painting the stone path in shades of jade and violet. [34] Kail, the jittery relic courier, adjusted the strap of his leather satchel, the dragonfly-wing pendant inside clicking faintly against the glass vials. [54] He’d been warned not to let the relic’s vibrations unsettle him—*“It’s just a tool,”* his absent mentor, Veyra, had said months ago, her voice still echoing in his skull. [84] But tools had edges, and Kail’s nerves were already frayed from the journey. [97]

He’d last seen Veyra at the edge of the ridgeway, her silhouette dissolving into the aurora’s glow as she muttered, *“Germinate the past. Let it root in the present.”* [128] At the time, he’d thought it nonsense. Now, clutching the pendant, he wondered if she’d meant for him to *feel* the relic’s purpose. [150] The dragonfly wing, etched with runes, wasn’t just a keepsake—it pulsed, a faint hum resonating in his palm. [172] Veyra had taught him that relics *extended* brief encounters, turning fleeting moments into seeds. [191] But how?

The ridgeway climbed, its stones slick with frost. Kail’s breath misted in the cold, and he shivered, not just from the temperature. [220] Ahead, a figure emerged from the aurora’s haze—a woman in a patched cloak, her face obscured by a hood. [240] She carried a lantern, its light warping the colors around her. [253] Kail’s instincts screamed to keep moving, but the pendant vibrated harder, as if urging him to stop. [277]

“You’re late,” the woman said, her voice raspy. [288] Kail froze. She knew his schedule? [297] “Veyra sent me,” she added, though Kail had never seen her before. [316] The pendant’s hum sharpened, and for a heartbeat, he swore he heard Veyra’s laughter—a sound he’d carried in his memory since her disappearance. [342]

The woman reached into her cloak and withdrew a small vial. “Germinate this,” she said, pressing it into his hand. [364] Inside, a seed glowed faintly, its surface marked with the same runes as the pendant. [382] “Plant it where the aurora touches the stone. The vibration will do the rest.” [403]

Kail hesitated. Veyra’s lessons had been erratic, her methods cryptic. *“Trust the relic,”* she’d said, *“but question everything.”* [428] He glanced at the pendant, now thrumming like a heartbeat. [440] The woman’s lantern flickered, casting her face in shadow. [451] “Why me?” he asked. [457]

She smiled, a thin, knowing curve. “Because you extend brief encounters. You make them linger.” [478] Before he could reply, she melted into the aurora, her form dissolving like smoke. [497]

Kail stood alone, the vial cold in his palm. The ridgeway stretched before him, the aurora pulsing in time with the pendant. [520] He thought of Veyra—of her abrupt departures, her refusal to explain. *“Some truths are seeds,”* she’d once said. *“They need time to root.”* [546]

He knelt, pressing the seed into the frost-cracked stone. The pendant’s vibration intensified, a low, resonant thrum that seemed to shake the very air. [572] The aurora swirled above him, its colors coiling like tendrils. The seed glowed brighter, and Kail felt a strange warmth in his chest—not from the cold, but from something deeper. [599]

The stone beneath him trembled. Roots erupted, thin and silver, weaving through the cracks. [618] They grew rapidly, twisting into a sapling, its leaves iridescent under the aurora. [637] The pendant’s hum faded, replaced by a chorus of whispers—Veyra’s voice, the woman’s, and others, faint and distant. [659]

Kail touched the sapling’s bark. It was smooth, warm, and etched with runes. [674] The dragonfly-wing pendant lay at its base, its vibrations stilled. [687] He picked it up, the metal cool against his skin. For the first time, he understood. [703]

Veyra’s absence wasn’t an ending—it was a germination. Her lessons, her relics, her fleeting encounters—they’d all been seeds. [726] And Kail, the jittery courier, had been the soil. [738]

The aurora faded, leaving the ridgeway in twilight. Kail smiled, the weight of the pendant lighter in his hand. [750]
