The lantern maker’s fingers trembled as she polished the final gem, its facets catching the twilight like a thousand captured stars. [44] Her workshop, perched on the edge of a floating island tea garden, smelled of lavender smoke and regret. [54] The glass basilica on the isle’s center hummed, its spires twisting upward as if trying to shed the weight of the sky. [68] She’d built it years ago, after the shadow detached—that nameless, hungry thing that had torn her brother from the world and left her with a hole where his laughter once lived. [94]

“Dreams are just grief with wings,” she muttered, dipping a cloth into a bowl of crushed moonstone. [106] The gem’s surface dulled under her touch, then flared brighter as she worked, a method she’d perfected: polish until the stone weeps, then capture the light. [128] Her lanterns weren’t for illumination—they were for recording. Each held a sliver of someone’s dream, a fragment of sleep spun into glass. [150] But tonight, she’d craft one for herself, a vessel to hold the memory of her brother’s last words before the shadow took him. [170]

The tea garden below her stirred. Floating islands drifted like lily pads on a sea of clouds, their undersides glittering with bioluminescent moss. [192] Patrons sipped jasmine tea from cups shaped like lotus blossoms, their conversations soft as moth wings. [208] No one noticed the lantern maker’s secret: her basilica descended while ascending. Its foundation sank into the island’s core, but its spires pierced the heavens, a paradox of gravity and yearning. [240]

She’d discovered the trick after the shadow’s visit. Grief, she’d learned, could not be buried; it had to be folded. So she’d begun crafting origami cranes from her sorrow, each one a plea to the void. [272] But the cranes kept unraveling. Only the lanterns held their shape, their light a fragile bridge between here and gone. [294]

The gem in her hand shuddered, its facets reflecting a face she hadn’t seen in years. Her brother’s smile, wry and warm, flickered like a candle flame. [320] “You’ll never outrun the dark,” he’d said the night before he vanished. She’d scoffed then, but now she understood. The shadow wasn’t something to flee—it was something to transform. [348]

She pressed the polished gem into a lantern’s heart. The glass basilica shuddered, its spires shedding shards of light that spiraled into the sky. [370] Below, the tea garden patrons gasped as the fragments descended, not as falling debris, but as ascending stars. [390] The lantern maker laughed, a sound brittle as winter ice. This was her magic: to descend while ascending, to fold grief into something that could fly. [422]

The dream recording began. Her brother’s voice spilled from the lantern, a cascade of memories—his laughter, his hands mending her broken toys, the way he’d hummed off-key lullabies. [454] The light swelled, filling the basilica with a luminous torment, beautiful and agonizing. She closed her eyes, letting the pain wash over her. This was how she survived: by polishing her wounds into gems, by letting the light in. [490]

Outside, the origami cranes she’d left scattered across the garden began to stir. One by one, they caught the lantern’s glow and took flight, their paper wings carrying them toward the basilica’s spires. [522] The lantern maker watched, her heart a knot of ache and awe. She’d always thought transformation meant shedding the past, but now she saw it differently. To transform was to carry the old into the new, to let grief and hope intertwine like vines. [568]

The shadow detached again that night, a wisp of cold slipping through her workshop window. She didn’t flinch. Instead, she held up the lantern, its light piercing the dark. “I see you,” she whispered. “And I’m not afraid.” [600]

The shadow recoiled, then dissolved into mist. The lantern maker smiled, her fingers still trembling. She’d fold this moment into a crane too, she decided. And when the next shadow came, she’d be ready. [632]

By dawn, the floating island tea garden buzzed with tales of the miraculous light show. Patrons debated whether it was a divine sign or a trick of the mind. [658] The lantern maker didn’t care. She was already polishing her next gem, its surface dull and pitted. Soon, it would shine. Soon, it would hold another dream. [680]
