The first time I saw my own grave, I was standing in the shadow of a mountain ranger cabin, its weathered logs groaning under the weight of decades. [29] The headstone was crude, chipped, and half-buried in snow—a mossy marker with my name etched in uneven letters. [42] I laughed, though it was a hollow sound, and wondered if this was some sick joke the universe played on lucid dream chroniclers who’d outstayed their welcome. [63] My name, *Elias Voss*, stared back at me, along with a date of death that was ten years ago. [78] I’d never felt so alive and so dead at the same time. [90]

I’d come to the cabin to escape the chaos of the waking world, to distill its fractured rhythms into something resembling narrative. [111] But now, standing before my own epitaph, I realized the chaos wasn’t outside—it was inside, a feral nostalgia that clawed at my ribs, demanding to be heard. [134] I’d always been chronologically confused, my memories a jumbled tapestry of past and present, dreams and reality. [151] This grave was just another thread in the weave. [162]

Inside the cabin, I found a birch bark scroll tucked beneath a floorboard, its edges frayed but its surface still smooth. [178] The script was mine, though I didn’t remember writing it—a chronicler’s curse, to forget the very acts of chronicling. [199] The words described a dream where I soared above the mountains, my body a specter of smoke and memory, jealous of the past selves I’d left behind. [226] *“They knew how to live,”* the scroll read, *“before the weight of years turned their bones to lead.”* [243]

I lit a lantern, its flickering light casting shadows that danced like ghosts. [257] The cabin smelled of pine resin and old books, a scent that should’ve been comforting but only deepened my jaded wonder. [278] Outside, the wind howled, a sound that mimicked the voices of every past Elias I’d ever been—the idealist, the lover, the fool. [299] I hated them all, in that moment, for their clarity, their certainty. [314] I hated them for being dead while I remained, trapped in this liminal space between breaths. [335]

The scroll’s next passage described a ritual: *“To soar, you must first fall. To remember, you must first forget.”* [356] I scoffed, but my hands trembled as I unrolled the birch bark further. [371] There was a map, crudely drawn, of the surrounding mountains, with an X marked near a cliff’s edge. [392] The note beside it read, *“The ledge where you first learned to fly.”* [405]

I hadn’t flown in years—not since the accident that left me with a limp and a permanent distrust of gravity. [426] But the feral nostalgia in my chest wouldn’t be silenced. [439] I grabbed a coat, the scroll tucked under my arm, and stepped outside. [452] The snow crunched beneath my boots, a sound that should’ve been grounding but only made me feel more adrift. [473]

The climb was arduous, my breath coming in ragged gasps. [486] Every step felt like a betrayal of the Elias who’d once scaled these peaks without thought. [507] By the time I reached the ledge, dusk was painting the sky in bruised purples and oranges. [528] The X on the scroll aligned perfectly with a fissure in the rock, a narrow crevice just wide enough to squeeze through. [551]

Inside, the air was cold and still, the walls slick with ice. [564] At the far end, a shaft of moonlight illuminated a pedestal, upon which rested another scroll—this one blank. [585] I placed the birch bark beside it, and as I did, the words began to flow, not from my pen but from some deeper, primal place. [608] *“To soar, you must shed the weight of who you were,”* it read. *“To remember, you must become who you’ve forgotten.”* [635]

I closed my eyes, and for a moment, I was everywhere at once—the cabin, the grave, the ledge, the blank scroll. [656] Jealousy coiled in my gut, a green-eyed monster fed by the ghosts of past selves. [677] They’d had it so easy, those other Eliases, with their neat narratives and tidy endings. [698] I’d always been a mess, a collage of contradictions, a chronicler too busy living to ever truly record. [719]

But then, the jealousy faded, replaced by a strange, bittersweet clarity. [732] The feral nostalgia wasn’t a curse—it was a compass, pointing me toward the truth I’d been avoiding. [753] I wasn’t trapped in the past; I was *building* it, brick by brick, with every breath, every mistake, every soaring, stumbling step. [770]
