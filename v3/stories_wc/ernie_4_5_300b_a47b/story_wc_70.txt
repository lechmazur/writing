The city had been dark for hours, the blackout stretching from the skyscrapers downtown to the outskirts where Clara, the candid toll keeper, waited in her glass booth by the lightning collection tower. [46] Her job was simple: tally the energy harvested from storms, a task so routine she could recite the tower’s maintenance logs in her sleep. [60] But tonight, the air hummed with a restless energy, and the tower’s lattice of copper cables glowed faintly, as if holding secrets. [82] Clara leaned against the window, her breath fogging the glass, and wondered why the drones hadn’t returned from the hives. [98]

She’d always been involuntarily truthful—a quirk that made her both a trusted keeper and a social pariah. [115] When asked if her coffee was bitter, she’d say, “It tastes like regret,” and watch colleagues sputter. [129] But tonight, her candor felt like a burden. [137] The city’s blackout wasn’t just a power failure; it was a failure of wonder. [151] People had stopped marveling at the tower’s lightning-catching nets years ago, treating them like vending machines for electricity. [170] Clara wanted to reignite that awe, even if it meant confronting the tower’s secrets. [184]

A clang echoed from the tower’s base. [190] Clara stepped outside, her boots crunching gravel. [196] The drones—small, bee-shaped machines that pollinated the tower’s energy crystals—lay scattered, their wings crumpled. [217] The hives, usually buzzing with activity, were silent. [225] She knelt, picking up a drone. Its abdomen was split, revealing a lacquer box inside, its surface etched with swirling patterns. [246] The box was familiar; she’d seen similar ones in the tower’s archives, labeled *Property of the Keepers*. [263]

“You shouldn’t touch that,” a voice said. [269] Clara turned. Old Man Voss, the tower’s reclusive engineer, stood in the shadows, his face illuminated by the faint glow of the cables. [292] “Why not?” she asked, her voice involuntarily sharp. [299] “Because it’s a reveal,” he said, stepping closer. “A matchbox containing a cryptic riddle. Open it, and you’ll understand the failure.” [323]

Clara hesitated. Voss had always been secretive, his motives as opaque as the tower’s inner workings. [340] But the box pulsed in her hand, as if alive. [348] She opened it. Inside lay a tiny matchbox, its surface scrawled with a riddle: *“I am the keeper of the unseen, the bridge between the known and the dream. What am I?”* [378]

“Wonder,” Voss said, before she could answer. [384] “The drones weren’t just pollinating crystals—they were pollinating *doubt*. They carried tiny seeds of curiosity, planting them in the minds of passersby. But the hives failed because the city stopped believing.” [420]

Clara frowned. “Believing in what?” [426] “In the magic of the tower,” Voss said. “In the idea that something as chaotic as lightning could be tamed, harnessed, *understood*. The drones’ sensors detected disbelief, and they shut down. The hives can’t function without wonder.” [462]

The sky flashed, and the tower’s cables brightened, casting long shadows. [474] Clara thought of her routine, the endless tallying, the way she’d stopped looking up at the storms. [490] “So the blackout… it’s because we forgot to marvel?” [499] Voss nodded. “The tower runs on more than electricity. It runs on the collective awe of the city. Without it, the system collapses.” [523]

Clara clutched the lacquer box. “What do we do now?” [531] “Reignite the wonder,” Voss said. “Start with the truth. Tell people what the tower really does. Show them the drones’ purpose. Let them see the magic in the mundane.” [559]

She hesitated. Her candor had always been a liability, but maybe it was time to weaponize it. [578] The next morning, as the city slowly powered back on, Clara stood outside her booth, the lacquer box open beside her. [597] Passersby paused, drawn by the glint of the box and the keeper’s uncharacteristic smile. [613]

“The tower isn’t just a power plant,” she said, her voice clear and involuntarily earnest. “It’s a machine that runs on your curiosity. The drones failed because we stopped asking questions. But we can fix it. We can *choose* to wonder again.” [653]

A child pointed at the box. “What’s inside?” [659] Clara grinned. “A riddle. And the answer is *you*.” [670] The child’s eyes widened, and Clara felt a spark—not of electricity, but of something older, brighter. [688]

By dusk, the tower’s cables shone brighter than they had in years. [698] The drones, repaired and reprogrammed, buzzed back to their hives, their wings glinting in the nectar dusk—a tone Clara had always loved, the way the light turned golden and syrupy, as if the world were dipped in honey. [734]

She sat in her booth, the lacquer box on the counter, its riddle solved. [744] The city’s blackout was over, but Clara knew the real work had just begun. [758] Preserving wonder in routine wasn’t easy, but for the first time in years, she felt like she might succeed. [770]
