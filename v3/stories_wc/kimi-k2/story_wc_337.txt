The broken mask restorer, Lira, stepped into the prism sanctuary under starlight, her breath frosting in the interlaced hush that clung to the crystal walls like dew. [28]  
She carried a tapestry needle no longer than her thumb, its eye threaded with a single filament of moonlight, and the weight of every silence she had ever absorbed pressed against her ribs. [47]  
Centuries of unfinished mourning had pooled here, and the sanctuary’s faceted ceiling refracted the grief into pale specters that drifted just above the floor, their mouths sewn shut by invisible knots. [72]  
Tonight, one spirit—an old fisherman whose drowned crew still circled the reef—had begged her to exhume their names before the tide of forgetting rose any higher. [96]  
To do it, she would have to unravel the knots in the centuries-old fisherman’s net that lay coiled like a sleeping serpent on the altar, each knot a vow of silence the sea had exacted from the living. [125]  
Lira knelt, feeling the net’s salt crust bite her palms, and began to work with the tapestry needle, sliding its slender point beneath the first knot as though persuading a secret to loosen its grip on itself. [158]  
The knot sighed open, releasing a bead of silence that rolled into the needle’s eye and vanished, and the hush in the sanctuary deepened, accumulates silence like frost thickening on glass. [190]  
Another knot, another bead; the prism walls vibrated faintly, starlight scattering into restless shards that sketched the faces of the drowned across the floor. [215]  
With every knot she undid, Lira felt the fisherman’s memories rise through her fingertips—storm-bloated sails, the scrape of barnacles on drowned skin, the last shared secret between brothers before the wave struck. [250]  
She whispered that secret aloud, letting the words braid with the starlight, and the interlaced hush quivered, uncertain whether to scatter or to stay. [275]  
The spirit of the fisherman materialized beside her, his eyes two dark hooks still baited with longing, and he reached for the net as though it were the only map back to the living world. [305]  
Lira did not flinch; she had been a broken mask restorer long enough to know that every fracture was a doorway, and every doorway needed a threshold of truth. [335]  
She guided his translucent fingers to the next knot, showing him how to twist the tapestry needle so the silence spilled out like silver scales, each scale a name the sea had tried to swallow. [368]  
Together they worked, the sanctuary’s lucid unrest shimmering around them, until the net lay flat and open, a lacework of absences where knots had once clenched like fists. [398]  
The accumulated silence hovered above the altar, a pearl-gray cloud dense with every unspoken farewell, and Lira lifted the tapestry needle like a conductor’s baton. [428]  
With a single motion she pricked the cloud; it unraveled into threads of quiet that drifted downward and settled over the spirits like soft nets of sleep. [457]  
The fisherman looked at her, his face no longer a mask of salt and regret, and spoke the name of his youngest deckhand, the one he had failed to save, releasing it into the prism sanctuary like a bird at dawn. [495]  
One by one the other spirits followed, each exhuming a name across sharing a secret with the living woman who had dared to unpick their deaths. [525]  
As the last name left the fisherman’s lips, the prism sanctuary exhaled, and the interlaced hush dissolved into ordinary night sounds—wind against crystal, the hush of waves far below, the faint creak of a boat that no longer existed. [565]  
The spirits thinned to silver mist and drifted upward through the faceted ceiling, following the starlight home, and Lira felt the weight inside her lighten, though she knew tomorrow new silences would begin to gather. [610]  
She coiled the empty net around her arm, its knots now gentle loops that could never again bind a soul, and tucked the tapestry needle behind her ear like a pen that had finished writing a difficult letter. [650]  
Before leaving, she touched the altar, grounding restless spirits with a promise: “I will return when the next silence grows too heavy to bear alone.” [685]  
Outside, the tide had turned, and the stars above the prism sanctuary blinked like eyes that had finally been allowed to close. [715]  
Lira walked back toward the village, the broken mask restorer whose own mask—once cracked by every grief she had absorbed—now gleamed whole in the starlight, stitched together with threads of silence set free. [
