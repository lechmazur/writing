The crater inspector stood alone on the moonlit summit of Mount Halcyon, her suit’s visor catching the pale glow of Earthrise. [25]  
She had climbed through the thinning atmosphere to reach this place, where the dawning hush of the upper stratosphere pressed against her like a held breath. [45]  
In her gloved palm rested a single grain of sand—no larger than a pinhead—taken from the nightwatch’s hourglass in the abandoned orbital station. [70]  
That grain was the last remnant of the station’s timekeeper, a relic from the early days of the space age when humanity still believed the sky could be mapped like a garden. [100]  
She was purposefully curious, the kind of woman who catalogued every fracture in a crater wall as if it were a love letter from the planet’s core. [125]  
Tonight, her curiosity had a sharper edge: she had come to photograph the last of something precious—the final bloom of the summit’s ghost orchid, a plant that flowered only under lunar light and vacuum. [160]  
The orchid’s petals were rumored to open for seven minutes at the exact moment the terminator line kissed the peak, then collapse into frost. [190]  
She had thirty minutes until that moment, and she intended to outlast the cold, the thin air, and her own rising grief. [215]  
To mark the instant, she carried a micro-capsule of potassium permanganate and glycerin, a chemical reaction she had calibrated to ignite in exactly twenty-nine minutes. [245]  
The flash would serve as both timer and signal, letting her camera’s shutter know when to drink in the orchid’s ghost-white light. [270]  
She set the capsule beside her tripod, then knelt to brush frost from the crater’s lip, tracing the rim with a gloved finger like a blind reader. [300]  
The crater was young, only sixty years old, born from a deorbited satellite that had screamed across the sky the year she was born. [330]  
She had spent her life inspecting such wounds, measuring their depths, naming their fractures, yet never healing them. [355]  
Tonight, the crater felt different—less a scar than a cradle, cradling the orchid’s fragile hope. [375]  
She checked her camera’s battery, already draining in the cold, and whispered a promise to the orchid: I will not let you vanish unseen. [405]  
The dawning hush deepened; even the wind had forgotten how to speak at this altitude. [425]  
She thought of the hourglass in the station, how its sand had once measured shifts, meals, love affairs, and now measured nothing but absence. [455]  
That single grain in her pocket seemed to pulse, as if remembering every second it had once counted. [480]  
She pressed it into a tiny groove on the capsule’s casing, embedding it like a seed in synthetic soil. [505]  
When the reaction flared, the grain would vaporize, its history released as a violet streak against the stars. [530]  
Twenty minutes remained. [535]  
She paced the summit’s narrow spine, boots crunching on rime, her breath crystallizing into brief ghosts. [555]  
Each step echoed inside her helmet, a private drumbeat counting down to revelation. [575]  
She remembered her mother’s voice, decades ago, describing the first orbital gardens, how orchids had been coaxed to bloom in zero gravity, their roots reaching for light that had no up or down. [615]  
Now those gardens were gone, decommissioned, their last seeds drifting in cold storage. [640]  
The orchid beside the crater was the last descendant, a final argument against extinction. [660]  
Ten minutes. [662]  
She adjusted the camera’s focus until the orchid’s bud filled the frame, a pale comma against the dark. [685]  
The dawning hush grew heavier, as if the mountain itself were listening. [700]  
She felt the capsule’s warmth begin to rise, a slow fever beneath the frost. [720]  
Five minutes. [722]  
She steadied her hands, breathing slow, willing her pulse to quiet. [740]  
The orchid’s outer sepals trembled, then parted with a soundless sigh. [755]  
Petals unfurled like frostbitten silk, catching the moonlight and throwing it back as a ghost of color. [775]  
The capsule ignited—a brief, violet bloom that matched the orchid’s own. [790]  
The shutter clicked, freezing the moment forever. [800]
