The disenchanted queen stood at the balcony of the cobalt grotto above clouds, her breath frosting the night air. [21]  
After the final warning from the astronomers—"the bleeding starlight will consume the sky within three nights"—she had dismissed her courtiers and climbed alone toward the ember grotto on the ridge. [42]  
Each step up the basalt stair felt like walking through the lace of her own unease, delicate yet edged with menace. [59]  
In her recurring dreams, the same ridge burned with silent violet flames, and a voice softly commanding her to "remember the first spark" echoed until she woke gasping. [83]  
Tonight she intended to unravel the mystery of those dreams or let the starlight take her. [99]  
The path narrowed; wind hissed through cracks like whispers plotting. [112]  
She pressed on, palms against stone still warm from the day’s hidden sun. [125]  
Halfway up, she paused where the ridge split and a seam of quartz glimmered like frozen lightning. [141]  
There, memory ambushed her: as a child she had released a lantern here, believing it would ferry wishes to the stars; instead it had fallen, a brief ember swallowed by fog. [171]  
The shame of that failure had calcified into the crown she now loathed. [185]  
She resumed the climb, heartbeat syncing with the slow pulse of the mountain. [199]  
At the lip of the ember grotto she halted. [208]  
The cave mouth breathed heat scented of iron and pine resin. [219]  
Inside, constellations appeared to drip from the ceiling, bleeding starlight that pooled in runnels across the floor. [239]  
She stepped into the glow and felt the lace of menace tighten around her lungs. [254]  
A figure waited—herself, younger, barefoot, eyes wide with undimmed hope. [268]  
The child-queen extended a hand, palm cupped around a single firefly. [280]  
Together, without words, they performed the method taught by the dream: a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer. [303]  
Their breath mingled, luminous, and the firefly ignited into a ribbon of violet flame that stitched the bleeding starlight into a tapestry of memories. [325]  
Images unfurled: the lantern’s fall, the court’s applause when she first wore the crown, the astronomers’ final warning delivered beneath a sky already weeping light. [354]  
She saw how each moment fed the next like embers passed hand to hand. [368]  
The child-queen spoke at last, voice softly commanding, "Carry the spark or be carried by it." [387]  
Understanding pierced her: the dreams were not prophecy but invitation to choose a different ending. [404]  
She took the flame into her own chest, feeling it settle where ambition had once been. [420]  
The bleeding starlight dimmed, drawn inward, until only the firefly’s steady glow remained. [436]  
The cave walls cooled; the ridge outside quieted. [445]  
She and her younger self regarded one another, no longer adversaries but co-authors. [461]  
Together they walked out onto the ridge. [469]  
Below, the cobalt grotto above clouds glimmered like a promise reconsidered. [485]  
She lifted the firefly high; its light refracted across the sky, sealing the wounds of bleeding starlight with threads of dawn. [507]  
The astronomers’ instruments would record a miracle: the sky held. [520]  
Yet the queen knew the true miracle was smaller, quieter—the moment she chose to climb not for conquest but for reconciliation. [548]  
She descended the basalt stair slowly, the child-queen’s hand in hers, both now softly commanding the mountain to remember mercy. [574]  
At the balcony she released the firefly; it drifted upward, a living lantern carrying their shared exhale into the newborn night. [600]  
The disenchanted queen watched until the light vanished, not fallen this time but ascending, and for the first time in years she felt the weight of the crown shift from burden to blessing. [639]  
Behind her, the ember grotto on the ridge cooled to ordinary stone, its mystery unraveled yet somehow larger. [662]  
Above, stars shone steady, no longer bleeding but singing. [674]  
She whispered a promise to the wind: each summer she would return, climb again, and share another exhale with whatever part of herself still waited in the dark. [713]  
The lace of menace had become lace of memory, delicate yet enduring, binding past to future with threads of violet flame.
