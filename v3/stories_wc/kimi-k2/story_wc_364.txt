The orchard moons rose through the floating rock arches, blue-green halos that turned every fallen blossom into azure defiance on the ground below. [28]   
Meek blacksmith Kaia pressed her back against the mouth of the abandoned mine shaft, heartbeat thudding louder than the distant thrum of the planet's magnetic wings. [82]   
In her soot-streaked palms she clutched a rectangle of magician's silk no larger than a dinner napkin, its surface rippling with light that was neither cloth nor memory. [158]   
Tomorrow she would leave her forge forever and apprentice to the magicians who had promised the silk in exchange for her smith-work—yet they had warned, "If you don't wake something that refuses to die by first frost, we'll reclaim the fabric and the lesson will barter itself away from you." [286]   
Between understanding and confusion she hovered now; she understood the bargain, but nothing of what must awaken, or how. [368]   
Kaia's quiet determination surfaced not in words but in deliberate steps, descending the timber ladder the orchard crews had neglected for a decade. [442]   
The shaft walls glittered with petrified sap, smelling of burnt apples and cold iron; the deeper she went the warmer the air became, a sure sign life had crept nearer to the planet's pulse. [544]   
At the fifth landing the rungs stopped and the tunnel forked. [588]   
She unfolded the silk; its weft flickered, one thread blushing gold. [634]   
Kaia laid it across a heap of tumbled stone where pickaxes lay rusting like frozen birds, and backed away. [687]   
Hours thinned; the orchard moons swung high enough to peer through cracks in the ceiling, their light pooling on the magician's silk until the cloth lifted an inch, trembling. [772]   
A low moan cycled in the rock—a sound of splitting ore, not breath—followed by a glimmer of brass beneath the rubble. [843]   
Kaia knelt, feeling along the brass thread until it widened into a battered cog no wider than her thumb. [900]   
She recognized the maker's mark: her own, hammered ten years ago when she tried to build an orchard keeper that could walk beneath the floating arches and never bruise fruit. [1003]   
The experiment had collapsed, its heart seized, the automaton scattered down these very shafts as scrap and regret. [1084]   
With deliberate care Kaia coaxed the brass cog and the magician's silk closer; when the cloth touched metal, filaments of golden light wove through the rust, knitting oxide to memory. [1185]   
Piece after piece emerged from rubble, drawn by the silk like filings to a lodestone until the shape of a small humanoid sprawled before her. [1275]   
She whispered, "Live, little wanderer, and coax resilience from rubble where I failed." [1333]   
The silk fluttered, wrapping the automaton; steam rose, carrying blossom fragrance. [1395]   
Joints clicked awake; eyes of apple-quartz opened; the thing sat up, clanking yet graceful. [1460]   
Kaia's heart swelled with azure defiance: she had bartered her old failure for a new guardian. [1518]   
Above, magnetic wings hummed louder, announcing the first frost. [1569]   
The automaton clasped her sooty hand, its brass digits warm now, and she helped it limp toward the surface light. [1632]   
Together they ascended, past petrified sap and abandoned ore, until they stepped into the orchard air scented with ripe apples and electric midnight. [1722]   
The magicians awaited beside her cold forge, cloaks snapping, palms open. [1779]   
She set the silk into their hands, the cloth now dull like washed sky. [1829]   
"Awakening bartered," she said simply. [1861]   
They tested the breeze, sensing no reclaimed debt, then nodded and melted into the archways as if they had never traveled three planets to broker this deal. [1958]   
Kaia turned to the automaton. [1985]   
It raised a hand, tapped its own newly beating chest, and pointed to the rock arches high enough to scrape the orchard's moons. [2047]   
She understood its offer—together they would mind the fruit, prune the impossible boughs, mend whatever broke beneath the arches. [2121]   
Somewhere between understanding and confusion, her quiet determination kindled; she walked the rows of trees, the automaton limping beside her, both of them lit by a steady, stubborn azure glow. [2217]   
Resilience, once rubble, now walked the orchard world, and in its steps Kaia heard the forge of her own reborn heart ringing every color of courage. [2306]
