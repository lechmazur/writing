The reticent lighthouse supply skipper, Elias Crowe, climbed the spiral stairs after the lamp flickered out, the sudden darkness making the tower feel like a throat that had swallowed the moon. [34]  
He carried no replacement wick, only a pocket of sea glass he had found wedged in the jetty that morning, its edges worn smooth by tides and time. [50]  
The lantern room was said to be haunted by the last keeper’s widow, who walked the glass panes barefoot, searching for a letter her husband never sent. [68]  
Elias believed in tides, not ghosts, yet the air tasted of salt and lilacs, a warmly observant perfume that noted every tremor in his hands. [86]  
On the brass chart table lay a single envelope addressed to “Whoever Keeps the Light,” the newest link in an anonymous letter chain that had followed Elias from port to port for three years. [107]  
He slit it with his rigging knife and read by starlight: “Stack three stones north if the coast is clear, four if you fear the reef has shifted. [128]  
I send these words so someone will protect the feeling of safety I once drank like broth.” [145]  
The ache in the ink glowed, a luminescent ache that made Elias press the sea glass against his palm until it warmed. [162]  
He understood the code; it was the same way his mother had taught him to leave messages when nets tangled and storms lied—stacked cairns along the tideline, grammar of balance and silence. [184]  
Tonight the reef was quiet, but the widow’s footsteps circled, soft as moth wings, and Elias felt the room asking to be guarded. [202]  
He set the sea glass on the lens cradle, a tiny moon to hold back darker tides. [215]  
From his coat he drew three basalt pebbles he used for ballast and stacked them beside the door: north, clear passage, promise kept. [232]  
The widow paused; the lilac scent deepened, approving. [240]  
Elias breathed through the ache, letting it settle like sediment in a jar. [250]  
He remembered the first letter he ever received in the chain, slipped under his skiff’s thwart in a rain-soaked harbor: “The world is full of mouths that bite; be the hand that bottles the balm.” [275]  
Since then he had ferried groceries, batteries, and those envelopes, never asking names, only stacking stones in reply. [292]  
Tonight, though, the lantern room demanded more than a silent answer. [302]  
The widow’s shape gathered in the corner, a shimmer of starlight on dust. [312]  
She pointed to the sea glass, then to Elias’s chest, as if to say the balm must be sealed inside something living. [328]  
Elias took the glass again, rolled it against the hollow beneath his collarbone where fear pooled like bilge. [342]  
He whispered, “I will protect this feeling for you, for every soul who steers by our light.” [357]  
The widow smiled, a curve of phosphorescence, and stepped backward into the lens. [367]  
The glass flared once, borrowing her glow, then subsided, leaving Elias alone with the scent of lilacs fading to memory. [383]  
He carried the stones to the balcony and stacked them on the rail where spray could not reach: three, steady, a vow carved in gravity. [400]  
Below, the skiff rocked against the pier, empty of cargo but full of moonlight. [412]  
Elias removed a small tin flask from his pocket, the one he used to carry kerosene samples, now washed clean. [427]  
He held the sea glass over its mouth and let the ache drip—slow, silver, luminescent—until the flask brimmed with the feeling of safety he had learned to distill from salt, sorrow, and vigilance. [452]  
Corking it, he etched a single word on the lid with his knife: “Return.” [462]  
He placed the flask inside the anonymous envelope, along with a fresh sheet of paper. [474]  
On the paper he wrote, “Tonight the reef sleeps. [483]  
I keep the light, and the light keeps me. [492]  
When you are ready, send another letter; I will stack the stones again.” [505]  
He sealed the envelope, addressed it simply “To the Next Keeper,” and set it beneath the weight of the sea glass on the chart table. [523]  
The widow’s footsteps did not return, but the lantern room felt warmer, as if her ache had found a home inside the flask. [540]  
Elias descended the stairs
