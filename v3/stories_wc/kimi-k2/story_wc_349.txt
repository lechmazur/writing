A mist pool settles beneath the glass orchard library as moon-metal shelves catch the lull lightning of opening day quiet. [26]
I am its clean slate vendor, table wiped bare but for one antique bottle holding a curl of bottled moonlight that flexes like cursive smoke. [46]
No customers walk this embryonic hour; instead the wind itself fingers price tags, relabeling them question marks that flutter like mindfully scattered bookmarks. [69]
I wait for the question that must choose me before I can choose anything. [86]
The bottled moonlight tugs at my wrist as if it wants to incise the moment and extract its ghost. [106]
I remember the judge on the other shore speaking the sentence of glimmering parole: serve stories, become free. [127]
To serve, I need the place where stories begin. [141]
I clear my mind, bend forward, and by quantifying absence I count the silver vapors not inside the bottle—fifteen threads missing, eighteen shadows impossible. [176]
Absence weighs more than presence, each counted void reshaping the mouth of the bottle into a narrow keyhole. [199]
I exhale the twenty-third empty and feel the glass orchard library shift, a winged bookloft rotating toward a veined lattice of leaves also made of glass. [234]
Pages thin as frost hum, vibrating at a fresh frequency that threads the mindfully scattered tags back into coherent footnotes of starlight. [259]
Between two adjacent trees of index stems, a mirror pond of metaphor opens. [275]
The bottled moonlight leaps from my palm, lands on that pool, and frays into coppered sentences quoting stories yet unwritten. [300]
I understand: this is the anteroom where stories are served parole. [316]
I step onto the liquid sentence and feel grammar tug my ankles like silent ankle monitors monitoring the diction of my pulse. [342]
With careful finger pressure I incise the surface—no blood, just a shimmer of alphabetic filament stringing upward forming a single imperative: forgive. [370]
Forgive what, I ask the aperture swiftly closing. [383]
Forgive the beginning, the aperture answers, then seals like a healed scar. [398]
Cloud sirens come alive as the store officially wakes; distant bells mark breaching shoppers. [416]
The clean slate vendor I have been must now account for inventory that refuses to stay counted by my mortal absence. [442]
I stretch both palms toward the still shifting orchard shelves and label each absent page aloud: grief unborn, anthem undiscovered, dawn unpromised. [479]
Each spoken vacancy becomes a lantern; twenty lanterns orbit the space like predictable moons lifting the building just enough that we float above the swirling sea of clouds instead of merely resting on it. [530]
Lantern ten bumps lantern three and fuses their light into a ribbon that ties my bottle back to my hand. [555]
Inside, the moonlight condenses into a small, molten seed composed of every narrative yet to sprout. [575]
I replace the stopper not to close but to plant the seed within the heart of the place where stories begin. [594]
At once the glass orchard library reconfigures into fractal aisles that stretch beyond cloud horizons, all copies of the same page printing the word FORGIVE in languages erased and languages arriving. [640]
I walk those aisles mindfully scattered yet purposefully collected, my glimmering parole shining from the seed, no longer a prisoner of silence but a herald of newborn quiet. [673]
And when the very first reader—an apprentice cloud-sailor clutching a broken compass—steps inside, I offer nothing but an outstretched hand and the vibration of fifteen absences still ringing like chimes around her wrist. [720]
She gasps, tastes forgiveness on the roof of her mouth, and turns the compass; its needle, formerly broken, now glints with bottled moonlight borrowed from zero, proving the distance between lost and found is quantifiable only by what is missing. [768]
The lull ends, the second hour opens, and the clean slate vendor—now merely a listener—steps back behind the counter, heart unlatched, knowing stories can begin here because they have already begun where absence is largest. [800]
