The hanging orchard in the ravine had survived the empathy virus, but only in the way a shattered mirror still reflects. [25]
Branches of grafted pear and almond dangled like nooses above the flood-scoured gullies, and every storm that rolled in off the sea tore another root from the cliff. [45]
I came here after the plague years because the soil smelled of buried secrets and because truffles, being subterranean, had kept their rational distance from infected minds. [72]
My name is Lira Voss, truffle forager by trade, skeptic by temperament, and involuntarily truthful by lingering side-effect of the virus. [96]
Whatever I think becomes words the moment someone asks, a condition that makes ordinary markets impossible and black markets inevitable. [119]
Tonight the wind carried the metallic scent of lightning and the sweeter note of ripe fungus; I knelt beneath a pendulous almond bough, probing the loam with my calibrated fingers. [149]
The orchard’s owner, old Dr. Kestrel, had hired me to map the mycorrhizal networks before the next storm occluded the ravine with landslide and memory. [180]
In payment he offered an antique glass eye, milky blue, veined with hairline cracks like frost on a window. [205]
He claimed it had once belonged to Saint Veya, patron of smuggled relics, and that it could see through any lie except the one a person tells themselves. [237]
I tucked the eye into the inner pocket of my coat, more interested in its weight than its legend, and resumed my search for the black diamonds of the earth. [268]
Yet the moment the glass touched my ribs, words I had not intended slipped out: “I’m afraid the orchard will fall and I will fall with it.” [299]
Kestrel’s single real eye widened; the empty socket beneath his patch seemed to regard me with equal surprise. [323]
He led me to a cave cut into the ravine wall, where shelves of discredited textbooks leaned like drunks: herbals, alchemies, psychiatric grimoires from the century before the virus. [358]
Their pages prescribed rumored cures for the compulsion to speak truth—moss of the moon, tincture of amnesia, the smoke of burning contracts. [388]
I read aloud, unable to stop myself, and each recipe tasted bitter on my tongue. [408]
Kestrel confessed that the orchard itself was a smuggled relic, transplanted stone by stone from the fallen monastery of Saint Veya after the sea swallowed the coast. [446]
The glass eye had guided the monks through customs by rolling along corridors and winking at guards who believed it was merely a prosthetic. [479]
Now the orchard’s survival depended on psychological safety: if the trees sensed fear, they would retract their roots and the ravine would collapse. [513]
I laughed, a fractured sound between disbelief and wonder, and the sound cracked a branch overhead. [537]
Rain began, soft as apology, then hard as interrogation. [552]
Kestrel pressed the glass eye into my palm. [563]
“Plant it where the truffles cluster thickest,” he said. [576]
“The network will weave around it, and the orchard will mistake your honesty for stability.” [599]
I obeyed, digging beneath a mycorrhizal knot until my fingers found the warm pulse of the colony. [626]
The soil accepted the eye as if it were a seed. [639]
Immediately the compulsion to speak eased, replaced by a hush like snowfall inside my skull. [662]
Roots tightened around the glass, anchoring the cliff; leaves lifted, catching rain like chalices. [684]
Kestrel and I stood beneath the restored canopy, two flawed guardians of a sanctuary built from contraband and confession. [714]
When the next storm arrived, it battered the ravine with fists of wind, but the hanging orchard merely swayed, singing in a language older than lies. [750]
I stayed on as caretaker, cultivating truffles and psychological safety in equal measure, my involuntary truths now voluntary lullabies murmured to the roots. [785]
In the quiet hours before dawn, the antique glass eye glows softly beneath the loam, a pupil watching over the fragile grace we have managed not to break. [815]
