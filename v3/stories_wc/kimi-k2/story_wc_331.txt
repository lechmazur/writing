The scientific poetry library never closed, but at 3:17 a.m. only the odd-hour librarian, Mireille, moved between the shelves. [25]  
She walked with the sanely eccentric gait of someone who had memorized every creak in the parquet and chose to step on none of them. [42]  
Around her neck hung a tattered silk scarf the color of oxidized copper, its frayed ends brushing the spines of books that hummed with dormant equations. [63]  
Each volume bound verse to vector, metaphor to molecule; together they formed the only catalogued collection of analog memories on the continent. [83]  
While patrons browsed in half-lit alcoves, Mireille listened to the hush that lives between footnotes and heartbeats. [101]  
She was not shelving tonight; she was listening for the place where stories live when no one is reading them aloud. [121]  
The scarf had once belonged to the library’s founder, who claimed it could reawaken any narrative that had fallen asleep inside its own punctuation. [144]  
Mireille believed the claim the way cartographers believe dragons: provisionally, and with a map folded in a pocket. [165]  
At 3:23, the overhead bulbs flickered in a Fibonacci rhythm, and the geometry of the aisles began to bend. [185]  
Rows curved inward like parentheses nesting inside larger parentheses, aisles lengthening through hyperbolic geometry until the card catalog floated in a saddle-shaped horizon. [210]  
Patrons noticed nothing; their solitude was so complete they mistook curvature for concentration. [228]  
Mireille stepped off the Euclidean plane and followed the scarf’s tug, the fabric tightening as if a gentle hand were leading her by the collarbone. [252]  
The air smelled of hot toner and cold starlight, a combination that existed nowhere else. [270]  
She passed a doctoral student asleep on an open stanza about entropy, his drool pooling into a perfect Möbius strip. [291]  
She passed a janitor erasing marginalia with a cloth woven from forgotten punch cards. [308]  
At the library’s theoretical center, the scarf lifted horizontal, pointing to a shelf labeled “Pre-Prints, Unborn.” [328]  
There, wedged between a treatise on sonnet voltage and a codex of lullabies for black holes, lay a book with no title, its cover the same oxidized copper as the scarf. [356]  
Mireille opened it and found pages blank except for a single embossed coordinate: (θ, φ) = (i, ln 2). [376]  
The moment her fingertip touched the ink, the analog memories around her rustled like startled sparrows. [395]  
Equations unfolded into narratives: a love letter written in the spectral lines of hydrogen, a war diary encoded in protein folds. [417]  
They rose in shimmering threads, weaving themselves into the scarf, reawakening the stories that had been waiting for a reader who understood both meter and meter-per-second. [444]  
Mireille felt the library inhale, a vast lung drawing in centuries of unheard voices. [461]  
The hyperbolic aisles straightened, returning the floor to ordinary Euclidean tiles, but the air retained its new density of story. [483]  
Patrons lifted their heads, blinking as if surfacing from a dream they suddenly remembered. [501]  
One woman laughed at a joke about Planck’s constant that she had not yet read. [518]  
A child recited a stanza describing the taste of nebulae before the book was even open in his lap. [537]  
Mireille closed the copper book and shelved it exactly where it had been, now heavier by the weight of every voice it had released. [562]  
The scarf loosened, its frayed ends settling against her pulse like a satisfied cat. [578]  
She resumed her patrol, stepping once more between the creaks, listening for the next silence thick enough to bend. [598]  
Outside, dawn remained hours away, but inside the scientific poetry library the light had already changed color, shifting from fluorescent white to the warm sepia of remembered sunlight. [628]  
Mireille smiled the small, private smile of a sanely eccentric woman who had finally located the place where stories live: not on the page, not in the mind, but in the charged interval between reader and read, where geometry forgets to be straight and memory insists on being analog. [678]  
She adjusted the tattered silk scarf, feeling its new weight of voices, and walked on, guardian of the hour when solitude is observed most keenly and every silence is a door. [720]
