Cael Varis adjusted the holographic lenses perched on his brow, the neon lattice of the city below flickering like a half-remembered dream. [15] He was the last lore keeper of Nova Astra before its star-dimmed catacombs became museums, the only one who still spoke the dialect of lost circuits etched in human skin. [34] Tonight he carried the ruby flake—no larger than a fingernail yet older than the orbital rings encircling his birthplace—in a copper capsule slung against his heartbeat. [54] The gem sang, not with sound but with memories of a world before neon. [65] It pointed to the unclaimed throne said to exist somewhere out past the final security fence, the one that rejected every claimant for lacking the true map inscribed on living stone. [86]

He slipped between derelict cargo pods until he reached the waterfall, its spray diffusing the floodlights into liquid prisms. [106] Behind that kaleidoscopic curtain lay the hidden orchard his grandmother had described in bedtime histories—one final grove grown before engineered seasons sterilized the planet’s soil. [132] Vines heavy with silver fruit dangled over murals painted directly onto the rock, murals sealed under centuries of protective coatings as thick as eyelids on sleepless eyes. [159] Cael laid his palm against the cliff because the only way forward was through; he began to sally, stripping the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals one at a time, each layer a decade, each revealed scene a revelation: star-dock riots, lovers in vacuum suits trading ruby shards, a child staring at the reflection of a sky now paved with satellites. [221] Under ultraviolet starlight the colors returned like emotions once forgotten. [234] Dust swirled up, tasting of cinnamon and rust. [242] When the final flake lifted, a stairway of ascension unfolded—narrow, carved from the bones of the mountain itself, spiraling into mist that glimmered with firefly code. [271] The ruby flake in his hand burned hotter at every riser, guiding him as if it shared his pulse. [289]

He ascended wisely adventurous, testing footholds that had tempted fools before him, their graffiti scratched into basalt: names like promises, dates like epitaphs. [311] At the halfway ledge a mural met him level with his stare. [320] It showed the throne vacant, circled by figures whose faces had rotted out of the pigment yet whose crowns gleamed red—ruby flakes embedded into stone eyes. [345] He remembered his oath; to catalogue was not to own, yet the ruby flake insisted otherwise, nudging him upward. [367] Dawn’s first bruised color bled along the horizon. [375] Timeframe until sunrise measured now only in heartbeats. [385]

Near the summit the stairway widened into a platform where the air smelled of both composted orchard and fresh ozone. [406] Here the unclaimed throne stood—simple alloy grown warm from latent starlight, armrests engraved with circuit diagrams that shifted while he watched. [430] Cael approached and the ruby flake detached from the capsule as though it had always belonged elsewhere. [450] It fit into a recess no wider than a raindrop. [460] The throne replied with a soft click, a low hum that rose through his bones like nostalgia for futures that had never arrived. [482] Surrounding murals bloomed alive: holographic ancestors lined up to witness the first rightful claimant in four centuries. [501] They cheered with the tinny fidelity of archival recordings. [510] He felt their relief like weather. [516] Yet the lore keeper hesitated—the stories said sitting bound flesh to firmware, trading mortality for stewardship of the planetary archive. [536] His mind flickered to the orchard below, where fruit still ripened even without permission. [555]

He chose, not as king but as scribe; he recorded the throne’s entire lexicon into the ruby flake’s crystalline matrix, adding his own memory of waterfalls tasting like glass and grandmothers singing static lullabies. [593] Then he removed the flake again, the seat dimming to ordinary metal. [604] He turned to descend, carrying the new complete map in the jewel now warmed perfectly against his skin. [625] Sunrise ignited the eastern sky above neon spires as Cael stepped onto the orchard path. [644] Behind him the stairway folded back into cliff, sealing like a book returned to shelf. [661] He walked the corridor of kaleidoscopic droplets, his reflection fractured into a prism of selves he might become. [681] The orchard hummed approval; silver fruit chimed in the breeze. [692] He pressed the ruby flake against the trunk of a tree, embedding his future history into bark already learning to be ancient. [718] The trees stirred; somewhere a seed of tomorrow cracked open. [731] Cael Varis, last lore keeper, walked into the city of morning with the past and future balanced like water cupped in two careful palms, his footsteps the quiet beginning of legends about a man who refused a crown yet carried all its stories home.
