I stand on the floating meditation platform of sycamore hush, drifting fifteen feet above the lake, waiting for the student who will not yet know me. [30]
My name is unimportant; every year I lose a syllable of it, because I age backwards, a researcher of final endings before beginnings. [42]
Twenty-eight years ago, by your count, I was ninety-six; tonight I wear twenty-five around my neck like a silent medal. [56]
Under the unlabeled stars the magnetic grotto hums below our hovering stone, cradling iron memories that tug the needle in every bird’s heart. [74]
She arrives barefoot on the silver water, stepping as if the lake never intended to stay liquid, and asks the single question none have yet answered: “How do I vanish without dying?” [97]
I say nothing, because any sentence would close the only path that stays open by being left unspoken. [116]
Instead I toss a smooth round stone into the center of the pond beside the platform, setting the weaver in motion. [131]
We kneel on the warm slate and study the expanding rings like two astronomers reading a star’s last confession. [152]
Each ripple records a different truth about the stone; the widest circles confess its weight, the middle ones recite its velocity, the most intimate whispers of foam speak about the texture of the hand that threw it. [186]
Truth is always broken like this, sliced into concentric stories that only make sense if you wait for the last ring to disappear. [211]
I must withhold the direct answer tonight, because vanishing cannot be taught by telling; it must be absorbed through the patterns of delayed revelation. [245]
Five minutes, or thirty depending on how deeply she breathes, the surface grows mirror-calm again, and in that mirror she finally notices the absence of my reflection. [283]
“You’re not in the water,” she says, half gasp, half gratitude. [296]
I nod, eyes closed, continuing to age backwards in the trance, feeling the tug behind my ribs where next year’s heart will be one beat younger. [326]
Below us the grotto’s starlight-fed magnetism rises through the platform’s stone bones, coaxing the iron in my blood into spirals identical to the pond rings. [366]
This has always been my method: to let the pattern teach what words betray. [386]
When I woke this morning, my beard was thinner; yesterday I limped, today my knees remember elasticity. [411]
Each symptom assures me the experiment is working, that if I vanish into childhood my mind will finally hold the seed of every answer before it has been asked. [453]
The student does not know yet that she is the last data point. [470]
The grotto’s hum shifts pitch, and her breathing synchronizes involuntarily, lulled by the magnet-pulse matching her heartbeat to mine. [504]
In the returning stillness of the pond she sees the final set of rings, those that begin so faintly they seem like illusions until she realizes they are fading inward, shrinking toward the center as if time itself is crawling home. [569]
At that moment, delayed revelation unseals: every wave that traveled away is now returning. [600]
She watches the impossible convergence, the rings collapsing into the point where the stone still rests, and the stone itself becomes porous, a lace of pebble that remembers water more than mineral. [664]
My outline on the platform thins to chalk, then dust, then memory in reverse. [689]
She looks down; her own reflection begins to disappear from the edges inward. [710]
Understanding arrives without a word spoken: to vanish is to reverse the throw, to be the stone returning through the same rings, to let the water close itself like a healed artery. [758]
She smiles at the last ring just as I slip entirely into unbeing, twelve years old tomorrow, eleven the next, a small bright star shrinking into sycamore hush. [790]
