The ardent ferry deckhand, Cass, polished the brass rail one last time before the 7:15 commuter ferry slipped its moorings, unaware that tonight the vessel would vanish. [34]  
She tucked the empty hourglass into her coat pocket, a keepsake from her grandmother who had sworn time could be folded like paper. [50]  
Cass had always been resiliently positive, greeting every passenger with the same bright nod even when fog swallowed the channel and schedules dissolved. [66]  
Tonight the fog carried a violet shimmer, and the stars overhead looked sideways, as though clocks themselves had tilted ninety degrees. [82]  
She felt the ferry lurch—not forward across water, but downward, through a seam that opened like a sigh. [96]  
The spectral grotto under starlight unfolded beneath the hull, stalactites of frozen moonlight dripping into pools that reflected futures instead of faces. [113]  
Passengers gasped, then quieted, their reflections showing themselves stepping onto docks that did not yet exist. [127]  
Cass alone kept moving, her boots ringing on the deck that now hovered above an underground tide of silver mist. [142]  
She understood, without needing charts, that the ferry had crossed into the hour when clocks run sideways, when minutes crawl along the horizon like crabs. [159]  
Her motivation crystallized: to merge parallel timelines so that every version of these commuters might reach the same safe shore. [175]  
She knelt by the ship’s radio, its dials spinning without her touch, and began to radio across frequencies that braided themselves into music. [191]  
The empty hourglass warmed against her ribs, sandless yet humming, resonating with the static until patterns emerged—Morse, then melody, then memory. [208]  
Via interconnected patterns of light on water, sound in air, and heartbeat in chest, Cass mapped the branching paths that had scattered when the ferry left ordinary time. [226]  
Each pulse of the radio stitched a thread between worlds: here a child’s laughter echoed from a dock ten years ahead, there an old man’s sigh drifted from a morning not yet dawned. [245]  
The spectral grotto responded, its starlight rippling like curtains, revealing corridors of possibility that flickered open and shut. [260]  
Cass spoke into the mic, voice steady, “All aboard who ever were, converge on the now that holds.” [274]  
The ferry’s horn answered, a low chord that folded space, drawing versions of the vessel inward like petals closing. [288]  
Passengers saw their younger selves board, their older selves disembark, and for a breathless moment every timeline overlapped on the resiliently positive deckhand who refused to let any of them drift away. [308]  
Sand began to fall inside the hourglass, not from top to bottom but sideways, pooling against the glass like light against eyelids. [324]  
Cass felt the weight of every parallel second settle into her palms as she turned the hourglass on its side, aligning its flow with the tilted clocks. [340]  
The radio crackled one last pattern—three short, three long, three short—then fell silent, its work complete. [355]  
The spectral grotto dimmed, stars withdrawing into pinpricks, and the ferry rose, hull scraping gently back into ordinary water. [370]  
Morning commuters blinked, unsure why their eyes stung with unshed tears of déjà vu. [382]  
Cass alone remembered, pocketing the now-full hourglass whose sand still slid sideways whenever she tilted it. [396]  
She resumed polishing the rail, permanent transient smile in place, knowing the next crossing might demand the same impossible mercy. [412]  
Yet the ferry schedule, printed fresh that afternoon, listed an extra run at 7:15½, a ghost timetable only she could see. [428]  
Passengers boarding the next evening glanced at her, sensing they had met her before in dreams they could not name. [444]  
Cass greeted them, voice bright, while the hourglass ticked against her heartbeat, counting moments that refused to stay in line. [460]  
She understood her role: guardian of the threshold, ferryman to the almost-lost, keeper of the sideways clocks. [475]  
Each night she radioed again, weaving new patterns, ensuring no timeline unraveled beyond repair. [489]  
The spectral grotto waited below, patient, starlight pooling like spilled milk, ready to catch any vessel that slipped. [504]  
Cass walked the deck, humming the chord the horn had taught her, a lullaby for timelines learning to share the same horizon. [520]  
Some nights she saw herself in the crowd, older, younger, unchanged, all nodding back with resiliently positive certainty. [
