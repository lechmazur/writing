The recycled hull of the *Mercy’s Wake* creaked like an old violin as Lin drifted through the corridor, her feet barely brushing the deck plates. [28]  
She had been born three days after the last human child, and the ship’s gravity generators, starved of joy, now let her rise whenever her heart lifted. [47]  
Lin was the last steadfast pacifist, raised on stories of Kwan Yin, the goddess who wept for every wound. [66]  
In the chapel of reclaimed aluminum, she kept the relic: a single crystal droplet called Kwan Yin’s Tear, said to hold every grief the goddess could not voice. [89]  
Tonight the tear pulsed, faintly, like a lighthouse remembering the sea. [104]  
Lin pressed it to her palm and felt the weight of every faded photograph taped to the walls—faces of the vanished crew smiling through long-dried tears. [127]  
The ship’s AI, Echo, whispered through the vents, “The lock between dimensions is sealed by the shadow we refuse to see.” [150]  
Lin understood: shadow work, the long reckoning with everything denied. [165]  
She gathered the photographs, peeling them gently from the bulkhead, their edges flaking like ash. [183]  
Under the low amber lamp she began to stitch the images together with silver thread unraveled from an old emergency blanket. [205]  
Each stitch passed through a shimmer of crystallized sorrow, the tear guiding her needle like a compass of regret. [226]  
As the collage grew, the deck beneath her softened; she rose an inch, then two, buoyed by the strange lightness that came when her heart dared to feel. [252]  
Faces emerged in the patchwork: engineers who had died refusing to fire the last missile, medics who treated friend and foe alike, children born in transit who would never see soil. [283]  
Their eyes, once flat in death, now glimmered with borrowed life. [296]  
Echo spoke again, voice trembling like starlight on water, “The dimension is locked by the weight of what we buried. [318]  
Only the unflinching mirror of memory can pry it open.” [331]  
Lin’s needle paused over a picture of her mother, who had taught her that pacifism was not surrender but relentless presence. [354]  
A tear—her own this time—fell and dissolved into Kwan Yin’s Tear, doubling its glow. [373]  
The stitched tapestry lifted from her lap, hovering, a sail of ghosts. [386]  
She followed it through the silent mess hall, past hydroponic basil gone wild, to the airlock that had never opened since the final evacuation. [411]  
The inner door was etched with a sigil of interlocking circles, cold and dark. [428]  
Lin placed the tapestry against the metal; the photographs aligned, forming a spiral of remembered kindness. [449]  
Kwan Yin’s Tear flared, projecting the faint shimmer of every tear that had dried on those glossy surfaces. [470]  
The sigil answered, lines igniting like phosphor. [480]  
Airlock bolts sighed apart. [486]  
Beyond lay not vacuum but a corridor of translucent obsidian, breathing with distant starlight. [505]  
Lin stepped through, her body so light with sorrow transmuted that she floated above the glassy floor. [525]  
Shadows peeled from the walls and took the shapes of the photographed dead. [540]  
They did not speak; they simply opened their hands, revealing the wounds they had carried in secret. [559]  
Lin met each wound with her own memory of it, naming the fear, the rage, the helpless love. [578]  
With every naming, the shadows brightened, becoming lanterns. [590]  
The corridor widened into a vast chamber where a single door stood, made of compressed silence. [609]  
Lin understood the last step: she must offer the tear itself, the vessel of all unwept grief. [628]  
She lifted the crystal to her lips, whispered, “May what was locked be opened by mercy,” and set it into a hollow at the door’s center. [656]  
The tear dissolved, releasing a sound like wind through bamboo. [669]  
The door swung inward, revealing a garden of bioluminescent moss growing on the bones of old weapons. [689]  
Seeds drifted across the threshold, planting themselves in the recycled soil of the ship beyond. [707]  
Lin felt gravity return, gentle and kind, anchoring her feet to the deck she had never truly left. [726]  
Behind her, the corridor sealed, but the lanterns of shadow followed, settling into the walls of *Mercy’s Wake* like constell
