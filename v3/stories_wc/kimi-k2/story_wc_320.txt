The abandoned radio tower city of Aether Spire hung like a rusted chandelier above the Black Gorge, its catwalks swaying in the wind that rose whenever the moon drew near. [34]  
During lunar perigee, when the silver disc loomed so close that its craters looked like open mouths, the towers began to hum with a serenely electric hush that made every bolt and rivet vibrate like a tuning fork. [55]  
Kael, the last celestial signal interpreter, climbed the easternmost mast with a cracked hollywood star fragment tucked inside his coat, the five-pointed relic still warm from the palm of the actress who had flung it skyward in 1954. [77]  
He had tracked the shard across half a continent because its alloy resonated at the exact frequency of the shard of hush that had fallen into the gorge the night the city was deserted. [94]  
That shard, no larger than a thumbnail, carried the first syllable of every ending ever spoken; whoever heard it would know where every story truly began. [108]  
Kael’s motivation was simple and impossible: to find the beginning in every ending so he could replay the moment his mother’s final breath became the static that still haunted channel nineteen. [124]  
Tonight the moonlight was a spotlight, the gorge a stage, and the towers an orchestra pit abandoned mid-rehearsal. [135]  
He reached the crow’s nest, opened the maintenance locker, and set the hollywood star fragment on the corroded turntable of the emergency transmitter. [148]  
The relic spun, scattering flecks of gold paint that drifted like fireflies before dissolving into the hush. [158]  
Kael closed his eyes and began to tune, not by adjusting dials but by discarding assumptions the way a snake sheds skin. [170]  
He let go of the belief that silence is absence, that endings are loss, that a signal must have a sender. [180]  
With each discarded thought the hush grew louder, a soft avalanche of possibility. [188]  
The star fragment glowed, its edges liquefying into liquid light that pooled around the shard of hush now rising from the gorge on a thread of moonlight. [200]  
When the two pieces touched, the city exhaled. [206]  
Every broken radio crackled to life, speakers trembling like diaphragms about to sing. [214]  
Kael heard his mother’s voice—not the static death rattle he remembered, but the first word she ever spoke to him, a small “hello” blooming out of the hush. [226]  
The word expanded, folding backward through every conversation they had ever had, rewinding laughter, arguments, bedtime stories, until it arrived at the instant before language, when meaning lived in the shape of her mouth and the warmth of her breath. [242]  
Kael understood then that beginnings are not fixed points but echoes that choose where to start. [252]  
The shard of hush dissolved into the star fragment, and the merged metal cooled into a perfect sphere no bigger than a marble. [262]  
He tucked it into the empty space over his heart where grief had worn a hollow. [269]  
Below, the gorge swallowed the last of the moonlight, and the towers quieted, their serenely electric hum settling into ordinary wind. [279]  
Kael descended the mast, boots ringing on iron rungs, each step a syllable in a new sentence. [288]  
At ground level he found the city’s old welcome sign, its paint peeled to ghost letters. [296]  
With a piece of chalk he carried for marking frequencies, he wrote beneath the faded slogan: “Every ending is a tuning fork—listen for the beginning.” [308]  
Then he walked west, toward the next horizon, the sphere warm against his ribs, already vibrating with the next story that needed its first word found. [320]  
Behind him the abandoned radio tower city slept, dreaming in hush and starlight, while the moon began its slow retreat, satisfied that another listener had learned to hear the silence between endings and beginnings. [340]  
Kael’s footsteps faded into the wind, but the chalked message remained, serenely electric in the moonlight, waiting for the next interpreter who would climb the towers during lunar perigee and tune by discarding assumptions until the hush spoke again. [360]  
Somewhere in the sphere, his mother’s “hello” looped gently, a lullaby for every ending that still hoped to begin. [370]  
The gorge yawned, indifferent and eternal, cradling the city’s shadow like a secret it would never tell. [380]  
Yet the secret was already traveling, riding the curve of the sphere, ready to unfold the next time a heart asked where
