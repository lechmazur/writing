In the drowned bones of New Albion, Gutter-Gideon stalks the crusted tunnels where daylight never negotiates. [17]
He is the last wannabe philosopher squatting in the sewer level, scribbling logic across salt-pocked brick with charcoal pilfered from long-dead lamplighters. [31]
Tonight he cradles a seafarer’s chronometer cog—brass, thumb-size, a relic pried from the pocket watch of the admiral who set the quarantine fires. [46]
Its tick is silent, yet he hears it—an echo older than the plague that scrubbed the city clean of breath. [60]
Above the water-hollowed archways the ruins gleam, mussels clinking like coins on marble roofs, copper domes jutting at odd angles into the black Atlantic. [80]
The virus has retreated, at least epidemiologists say so; Gideon distrusts numbers broadcast from dry studios. [96]
He trusts strata. [98]
He works through sedimentary layers—ash, brick dust, condom wrappers, bone meal—each deposit a paragraph in the manuscript of collapse. [117]
With a trowel he rationally rebellious pries the narrative away from official survivors who preach rebirth via solar grids and cloud algorithms. [141]
They call it renewal; he calls it vandalism against memory. [154]
The ancient method is simple: record a thing fully before it petrifies into slogan. [173]
Tonight the chronometer cog demands its page. [181]
Its teeth have scraped across both longitudes and latitudes, measuring longitude until the satellites drowned. [198]
Gideon squats over the sludge trench, his coat of sailcloth stiff with silt, and begins to agonize—not out of melodrama, but as one might twist a stuck valve, slow steady torque to free a memory. [229]
He scrapes brick, layer upon layer, dredging up the week the admiralty ordered fire-ships lit. [248]
He maps the plague’s timeline in midden rings, each stratum a day of fever and denial, down to the hour when sirens dissolved into gulls. [271]
One rumor insists the admiralty used the chronometer to pace the burning precisely, minute by minute, so no alley would escape sterilization. [296]
Another tale whispers the admiral sabotaged it, trying to grant citizens three extra minutes—three minutes to choose the window or the door before smoke drowned the choices. [324]
These narratives wrestle like eels within him. [336]
He lays the cog in a tin bowl of brine, counts sixty brass reflections, then lifts it dripping. [354]
The rebel in him wants the heroic version, the philosopher craves accuracy, and the man between just wants survivors to stop lying. [381]
Each lie erodes a datum; sand hissed away from truth. [393]
From an upper conduit a voice drifts down—Suture, the scavenger girl, stringing fiber-optic vines like prayer flags. [413]
“They say ghosts edit history,” she sings, “but only the living erase.” [427]
Gideon spits into the trench, abrasive calm coating his tone like enamel. [444]
“Words silt over like any corpse,” he answers, “I’m keeping the corpse in plain sight.” [462]
He pulls out a brittle envelope of vellum rescued from the library last week. [479]
On it he copies both versions of the burning minute-by-minute, the ruthless schedule and the fabled mercy. [500]
When the accounts contradict, he writes the contradiction, marks the uncertainty in red squid ink. [518]
This act of recording feels like surgery performed on himself, but he persists, jaw clenched as the cog spins between his thumb and forefinger. [545]
Suture crouches beside him, licking rust from her knife. [561]
“Why preserve pain?” she asks. [569]
“Pain untouched calcifies into justification,” he replies. “A fossil of excuses we mine to bomb again.” [588]
Hours condense; tide gurgles through cracks, rising a centimeter every nine minutes. [605]
Soon their knees are wet. [613]
Gideon lifts the completed sheet, folds it round the cog, and slips both into a copper tube soldered shut. [635]
He drags a slab of marble—probably a ballroom tile—over the trench, sealing the archive beneath. [654]
The act is neither triumph nor despair, only a stubborn planting. [668]
He stands, knees pop, and turns his face toward the vertical slit of moonlight miles above. [686]
“Competing narratives cannot both win,” he mutters, “but they can both be remembered, weighed like ballast so the next ship does not list so easily.” [712]
He shoulders his pack, nodding to Suture. [720]
Together they slog upward, water slapping calves. [730]
Behind them, beneath marble, brass, and sediment, the sewer keeps the last clock that ever measured a burning city—a witness too mute to lie, too metal to rot. [763]
Above the tidemark, dawn rinses a lavender smear across the ribs of cathedrals, but down here the philosopher and the girl carry the only sunrise that matters: truth, unburned, untold, waiting in layers for whomever digs afterward. [800]
