The sunken orchard greenhouse rose from the tidal mud like a cathedral bell jar, its iron ribs entwined with salt roses and the ribs of three shipwrecks that had once tried to sail inland. [34]
Inside, the air tasted of cider pressed in 1973, the year the hands-on folklorist Elara Finch first stepped between the fairy ring mushrooms that glowed faintly, as if remembering starlight. [52]
Now, decades later, she returned, chronically curious as ever, her pockets full of broken constellation shards she had pried from the greenhouse’s shattered skylight during last night’s storm. [70]
The shards were not glass but frozen sky, each fleck holding a memory someone had bartered away for the taste of an apple that never rotted. [88]
Elara knelt, gloved fingers brushing the fairy ring mushroom at the greenhouse’s heart; its cap bore the spiral scar of a stolen decade. [104]
She had come to detect what had been taken from her, the years between twenty-three and thirty-three that she could not recall except as the echo of a lullaby sung in a language of roots. [123]
Her habit of cataloging every folk song she ever heard had broken the morning she woke unable to remember her own mother’s voice. [141]
That rupture had driven her back to the greenhouse when habits break and certainties peel away like old varnish. [158]
She spread the constellation shards on the potting bench, arranging them by fracture pattern, studying how Orion’s belt had snapped into three unequal lengths, how Cassiopeia’s throne had splintered into a question mark. [180]
The greenhouse sighed, timbers creaking like a ship remembering the sea, and the fairy ring mushroom brightened, drawing sap from the buried keels. [198]
Elara touched a shard and felt the memory rush: her mother singing “The False Young Man” while slicing apples, the knife flashing like a comet. [216]
Another shard yielded the scent of her father’s pipe, the one carved from driftwood off the first wreck, its bowl still warm with unspoken stories. [234]
But the largest shard, shaped like a broken heart, remained dark, resisting her chronically curious gaze. [249]
She pressed it against the mushroom’s scar, and the greenhouse exhaled a fog of cider and brine. [263]
Images flickered: herself at twenty-five, trading her memories for the greenhouse’s promise of endless harvest, believing folklore was a gentle thing that never collected debts. [285]
The fairy ring mushroom pulsed, and she understood it was the ledger, each ring a decade owed, each glow a payment overdue. [303]
Elara’s hands shook as she lifted the mushroom, revealing the hollow root that had siphoned her years into the orchard’s perpetual bloom. [321]
She sang the lullaby she had almost forgotten, voice cracking like ice on a winter pond, and the root loosened, releasing a stream of silver motes that tasted of birthdays and first kisses. [344]
The shards on the bench flared, reassembling into a miniature sky that spun above the potting soil, constellations whole again but subtly altered, as if the memories had returned seasoned by absence. [368]
Elara felt the years settle back into her bones, heavier now, freighted with the crisp nostalgia of cider pressed long ago. [386]
The greenhouse dimmed, shipwreck ribs settling into quiet, and the fairy ring mushroom closed its scar, satisfied. [401]
She left the largest shard embedded in its cap, a reminder that some debts are paid in curiosity rather than coin. [419]
Outside, the tide had turned, exposing the orchard’s drowned trunks like the ribs of another wreck, and she walked between them, humming the lullaby her mother had never truly forgotten. [443]
The chronically curious part of her wondered what other memories lay buried beneath the shipwrecks, what other songs waited to be sung when habits break and the sky remembers it once belonged to everyone. [476]
But for now, she carried her recovered years in the rhythm of her footsteps, crisp and nostalgic as the first bite of an apple that had finally learned how to rot. [500]
