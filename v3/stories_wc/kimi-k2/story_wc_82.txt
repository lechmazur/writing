The lantern maker, whose name was Liora, stood at the edge of the floating island tea garden, watching the last of the shadow peel away from the glass basilica like burnt paper curling from flame. [34]  
After the shadow detaches, the basilica always brightens, its spires catching starlight and refracting it into the garden’s silver-leafed tea shrubs, so that every leaf seems to hold a tiny, trembling sun. [50]  
Liora had come here not for tea but for dreams, because the basilica’s vaulted halls were the only place where memories could be poured into crystal and replayed without shattering the mind. [70]  
She carried a satchel of grief heavier than any lantern: folded letters, a child’s wooden bird, and the echo of her sister’s last laugh. [88]  
Her craft was to trap light, but her motive tonight was to fold grief into origami cranes, one for every day since the plague ships left the lower skies. [108]  
The garden’s levitating stones hummed beneath her boots as she approached the basilica’s gate, which opened at a whisper of her true name. [126]  
Inside, the nave floated upside-down above her, a mirror of itself, so that walking forward felt like falling upward; this was the paradox the monks called descends while ascending. [149]  
Columns of living glass sang softly, their harmonics tuned to the heartbeat of anyone who entered, and Liora’s pulse answered in minor thirds. [169]  
At the altar of dreams, a single moonstone sphere waited on a cushion of moss. [181]  
She set down her satchel, withdrew a velvet pouch, and began the method she had perfected over years of luminous torment: gem polishing. [201]  
Each facet she ground away was a regret, each swirl of diamond dust a sigh released. [215]  
When the sphere shone like a tear of distilled dawn, she pressed it against her forehead and let the memory of her sister’s final morning flood through. [235]  
The basilica’s walls liquefied into mirrors, replaying the scene: the child coughing petals of blue fire, the physician’s mask cracking, Liora’s own hands shaking as she promised to remember everything. [259]  
The dream recording crystallized inside the moonstone, a perfect sphere of light and sorrow. [272]  
But memory alone could not transform grief; it had to be shaped. [283]  
Liora withdrew a sheet of translucent paper woven from spider-silk and starlight, the same material she used for lantern panes. [301]  
She breathed on the paper until it softened, then folded it with the precision of a woman who had once folded hospital sheets into swans to amuse dying children. [323]  
Each crease was a day survived, each tuck a refusal to forget. [334]  
As she worked, the basilica began to rotate, its orientation flipping so that the floor became the ceiling and the altar hung like a stalactite; still she folded, descends while ascending, her body obeying the inverse gravity without thought. [360]  
The cranes took shape: wings edged in violet flame, bodies luminous with trapped starlight. [373]  
When the hundredth crane was finished, the basilica shuddered, and the moonstone sphere cracked open along its polished seams. [389]  
From the fissure rose a swirl of indigo mist that wrapped around the cranes, infusing them with motion. [403]  
They lifted from her palms, circled her head once, then flew toward the glass ceiling, which parted like water. [418]  
Each crane carried a fragment of the recorded dream, scattering it across the night sky where it would become a new constellation named for the sister who had loved origami. [440]  
Liora felt the weight in her satchel lessen, not because the objects were gone but because their meaning had shifted. [457]  
She understood now that to transform grief was not to erase it but to give it wings bright enough to blind the darkness. [477]  
The basilica dimmed, its duty discharged, and the garden outside began to sink toward the lower clouds, the island obeying the same paradox: descends while ascending, returning her to the world below. [503]  
As she stepped onto the mossy path, a single crane drifted back, landing on her shoulder. [518]  
Its paper body was warm, and when she unfolded it she found not a memory but a future: a sketch of a child’s hospital ward lit by a thousand paper lanterns, each one burning with hope instead of mourning. [545]  
Liora smiled, the first unforced curve of her mouth in a year. [558]  
She tucked the sketch into her pouch, already planning
