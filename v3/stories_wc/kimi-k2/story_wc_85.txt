The cobalt terrace at dusk felt colder than the sea below, and Mara pressed her palms against the stone balustrade as though the chill could quell the memories she had manufactured for strangers. [34]  
She was a guilt-ridden black-market genealogist, the kind who sold counterfeit lineages to refugees desperate for citizenship, and every forged certificate carried the sieved hush of a family that never existed. [52]  
Tonight, under the weight of unspoken words, she had come to the forgotten shore beneath the terrace to discover the weight of a withheld truth about her own blood. [70]  
The tide had curled back, exposing driftwood carvings half-buried in wet sand, and she knelt, knowing her method was to sift through them for the one piece that might speak. [90]  
Each carving was a letter from the past: a child’s toy boat, a splintered crutch, a doorframe scorched by fire, all worn smooth by salt and regret. [108]  
She lifted a twisted length shaped like a crooked finger and felt the watch hand lodged inside its heart, a slender shard of brass ticking faintly though no dial remained. [128]  
The metal vibrated against her skin like a pulse, and she understood it was the same hand torn from her mother’s wrist the night the militia came, the night Mara had hidden beneath the crib and kept silent. [150]  
That silence had grown inside her, branching into every false memory she later manufactured for others, each lie another layer of driftwood over the wound. [170]  
She turned the carving over and saw initials burnt into the grain: M.T.—her mother’s. [183]  
The sieved hush deepened, a hush that was not absence of sound but absence of absolution, and Mara felt the terrace above lean closer, dusk pressing cobalt against her shoulders. [205]  
She remembered how her mother used to wind the watch at sunset, saying time was a ribbon you could gather or let trail, but never cut. [225]  
Mara had cut it anyway, severing her lineage from herself the moment she sold the first fake pedigree, trading heritage for survival, then for comfort, then for habit. [247]  
Now the watch hand ticked louder, counting backwards, demanding she quell the noise of guilt by facing its source. [264]  
She set the carving down and began to dig, fingers scraping wet sand, until she uncovered a small tin box corroded orange. [283]  
Inside lay a photograph curled like a dried leaf: her mother holding infant Mara on the terrace steps, the same cobalt tiles behind them, the same hour of dusk. [305]  
On the back, in hurried ink: “If they take me, tell her the truth weighs less than silence.” [321]  
Mara’s breath fogged the tin; the words echoed inside her ribs, heavier than any lie she had ever scripted. [337]  
She realized the withheld truth was not a secret about her mother’s fate—she had always known the militia shot dissenters at the pier—but the truth that her silence had been a choice, not a necessity. [361]  
The false memories she manufactured were not just for clients; they were for herself, bright coats of paint over the raw fact that she had lived by erasing. [382]  
The watch hand pulsed again, and she pressed it to her ear, hearing not gears but her mother’s last lullaby sieved through years of hush. [401]  
She stood, cradling the driftwood carving and the photograph, and climbed the crumbling stairs back to the cobalt terrace. [418]  
Dusk had thinned to a violet line, and the first star hung like a question mark. [432]  
Mara took the watch hand and fitted it into the broken watch she still carried in her pocket, the one her mother had given her, the one she had never had repaired because stopping time felt safer than keeping it. [461]  
The hand clicked home, and the watch began to tick forward, steady, unafraid. [474]  
She spoke aloud, the first honest words in years: “I chose silence, and I can choose voice.” [490]  
The terrace seemed to exhale, tempered regret loosening its grip like frost melting from iron. [506]  
She opened her notebook—the one filled with blank certificates—and on the first page she wrote her mother’s real name, her own real name, the date of the shooting, and the date of her return. [532]  
Then she tore the page out and let the wind carry it toward the sea, a paper boat carrying truth back into the current of time. [553]  
Below, the driftwood carvings gleamed wetly, no longer relics of erasure but markers of a shore where memory could
