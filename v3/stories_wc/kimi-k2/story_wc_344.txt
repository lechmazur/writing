Under the soft hush of a distant morning, the frozen library above clouds glimmered like a shard of driftglass caught in starlight. [25]
Its corridors were floored with frost that rang like crystal bells beneath every footfall, and the air tasted of iron and old paper. [42]
In the highest gallery, where breath became pale ghosts, the lunar-eclipse locksmith knelt among shelves of petrified atlases, searching for scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner. [71]
Each scrap was a sliver of moonscript, inked with silver that only shone when the eclipse crossed the sky outside the arched windows. [94]
She had come to learn the rhythm of repair, the secret cadence that could mend the cracked hours of the world below. [117]
Her coat, stitched from the hide of a sky-whale, shed flakes of frost as she moved, and the brass key that hung at her throat pulsed like a second heart. [144]
On the table before her lay the clockmaker's gear assortment: wheels of aurum and cobalt, springs wound from dragon sinew, and a single gear carved from the petrified tear of a forgotten god. [180]
They were the last intact set, salvaged from the workshop that had fallen into the sea when time itself began to stutter. [207]
She uncapped a vial of distilled eclipse-light, letting the liquid darkness drip onto the gears; the metal drank it in and began to hum a lullaby older than memory. [240]
The hum guided her through the hall of mirrors that waited beyond the gallery, a chamber where reflections were not images but memories stolen from every traveler who had ever passed. [275]
The mirrors were hauntingly bright, each pane blazing with the noon of a different day, so that walking among them felt like drowning in sunlight. [305]
She saw herself at seven, learning to pick the lock of her father's grief after her mother vanished into the gears of the sky-clock. [335]
She saw the moment she chose the title lunar-eclipse locksmith, swearing to fix what the sky had broken. [360]
The scraps of prophecy fluttered in her pocket, spelling out a rhythm in half-words: tick, pause, mend, release. [385]
She stepped to the center of the hall, where a mirror stood cracked from crown to base, leaking daylight like blood. [410]
Behind the fracture she glimpsed the world below: continents stuttering, oceans skipping tides, children aging between blinks. [440]
The clockmaker's gear assortment trembled in her palm, aligning to the heartbeat of the broken mirror. [465]
She pressed the petrified tear into the crack, and the mirror sang, a note so pure it tasted of salt and cedar. [490]
The rhythm of repair unfolded: tick as the tear locked into place, pause as the mirrors dimmed, mend as the gears meshed with the sky's hidden machinery, release as the eclipse outside completed its arc. [535]
Light folded into light, and the hall of mirrors became a single window looking out on a world where time flowed steady as tide. [565]
The lunar-eclipse locksmith exhaled, her breath forming the final scrap of prophecy: "When the last gear turns, the locksmith becomes the lock." [600]
She felt the brass key at her throat fuse to her skin, felt her joints click into the grand mechanism she had restored. [630]
Driftwood nostalgia washed through her, the scent of beaches she had never walked, the echo of gulls she had never heard. [660]
Yet she smiled, because the rhythm of repair was now her own heartbeat, steady, patient, eternal. [685]
Above the clouds, under the soft hush of a distant morning, the frozen library closed its doors, and the mirrors dimmed to silver pools, waiting for the next traveler who would come to learn the rhythm of repair. [730]
