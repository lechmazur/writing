The marble cavern breathed cold light, veins of quartz catching the wounded season’s pale sun like cracked glass. [21]
Inside, Arlen the locksmith knelt beside a broken timer mechanism, its brass ribs splayed open like a bird that had forgotten how to fly. [38]
He was peripherally focused, eyes never quite resting on the thing itself but on the trembling reflections it cast across the polished floor. [58]
Each reflection carried a whisper of the harvest of echoes, the cavern’s old habit of keeping every sound that had ever bounced here. [78]
Arlen had come to reverse-engineer wonder, to trap it in the cellar of reason before the season’s lull ended and wonder fled with the migrating swallows. [101]
He set the mechanism between two pillars, aligning its shattered dial so the noon light struck it at forty-three degrees, the angle he had studied yesterday. [127]
At that angle the reflections folded into corridors of memory, showing him the locksmith who had once oiled these gears for a duke who feared mortality. [152]
The duke’s voice echoed now, thin and silver: “Time is a lock; pick it gently.” [168]
Arlen noted the phrase, peripherally, while adjusting the dial to thirty-one degrees, the angle of dusk. [185]
The reflections darkened, revealing the harvest of echoes as a threshing floor where moments were beaten from husks of sound. [205]
He saw his own younger self running through these same halls, chasing fireflies of quartz-light, laughing. [222]
The laughter was stored here, ripening, waiting for someone to reverse-engineer its sweetness into something a rational cellar could hold. [245]
Night slid down the pillars; Arlen lit a single candle, its flame duplicated infinitely in the marble’s mirror veins. [265]
He turned the dial backward, a full revolution against the arrow, feeling gears bite reluctantly, as if tasting their own death. [287]
The mechanism ticked once, twice, then coughed out a spray of golden sparks that became moths of light. [305]
They circled him, brushing his beard with wings of memory: his mother’s lullabies, the first lock he ever picked, the last promise he failed to keep. [330]
Arlen did not reach for them; he remained peripherally focused, watching how their reflections landed on the cavern walls like seeds. [352]
He measured the angles—twelve degrees left of north, twenty-seven toward the ceiling—mapping the geometry of wonder. [373]
Each angle corresponded to a moment he would later file in the cellar of reason, labeled and shelved, safe from rot. [394]
The wounded season groaned outside; frost crept down the entrance tunnel, reaching pale fingers toward the mechanism as if to reclaim its escaped seconds. [418]
Arlen shielded the device with his coat, continuing the reverse-engineering by candle and frost-glow. [437]
He discovered a hairline crack in the escapement wheel; through it leaked a thin stream of echoes shaped like autumn leaves. [458]
He caught one on his palm: it was the sound of a girl laughing at a festival ten years ago, now crisp and dry. [478]
He placed it in a small tin box lined with velvet, the first resident of the cellar. [494]
Dawn returned, sickly and slow; the season’s wound refused to close. [508]
Arlen adjusted the dial to zero degrees, the angle of mirrors facing mirrors, infinity eating its own tail. [528]
The harvest of echoes condensed into a single bright note, pure as struck crystal. [545]
He trapped it inside the mechanism’s hollow core, soldered the crack shut, and wound the spring backward until it sighed. [566]
The timer now ran in reverse, second hands retreating, each tick a step deeper into the cellar of reason. [586]
Arlen carried it home through the lull’s last pale afternoon, peripherally noting how the swallows had already left the sky. [608]
In his cellar he placed the device on a shelf between a pressed lily and a child’s milk tooth. [627]
He labeled the shelf “Wonder, 3rd harvest,” then sat beside it, listening. [642]
From the timer came a soft reverse ticking, each beat releasing a stored echo into the cool dark: the duke’s warning, the girl’s laugh, his own footsteps chasing light. [671]
Arlen closed his eyes, neither happy nor sad, only certain that wonder had been safely filed while still alive enough to breathe. [697]
Outside, the wounded season healed into ordinary winter, and the marble cavern stood empty, its mirrors waiting for the next locksmith who would come to study reflections at different times. [730]
