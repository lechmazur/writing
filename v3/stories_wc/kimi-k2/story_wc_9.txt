The onyx-ink cartomancer climbed the midnight glade above clouds, her breath frosting in the choking beauty of starlight so thick it felt like drowning in silver. [28]
She carried the dolls’ tea set saucer crack like a splinter of guilt, its porcelain fissure catching moonlight the way a scream catches silence. [42]
After the birth, time had begun to pool in corners of the house—minutes puddling under the crib, hours clotting behind the rocking chair—until she could no longer pretend the world still moved forward. [67]
Her motivation was simple and impossible: to find where lost time accumulates, to gather it back before her daughter’s first birthday arrived empty-handed. [88]
The glade floated three miles above the valley where her child now slept, tethered to earth by nothing but the cartomancer’s will and the weight of what she had done. [111]
She knelt on moss that glowed faintly, unfastened the leather satchel at her hip, and spread her tools: a deck of cards inked with her own blood, the cracked saucer, and the linen tablecloth her mother had used for every birthday since memory began. [149]
The cloth was soft with age, its surface mapped by a family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths—each year a new outline, a new color, until the fabric became a constellation of growing palms. [183]
Tonight she would add her daughter’s hand before it had ever been traced, a preemptive ghost of a future she might still steal back. [208]
She laid the saucer at the center, the crack aligned north-south like a compass needle pointing toward forgiveness. [228]
The cards whispered as she shuffled, their onyx ink shifting to show scenes that had not yet happened: her daughter’s first steps, her first word, the moment the cartomancer would not be there to see either. [261]
Cloudbound repentance tasted like iron and lavender; she swallowed it willingly, perplexed by how surrender could feel so much like flight. [285]
She pressed her palm to the tablecloth, tracing the outline with a silver stylus that left no mark yet stole a sliver of her warmth. [311]
The glade responded, clouds beneath her swirling into the shape of a cradle rocking in reverse. [329]
Time, she realized, did not vanish; it condensed, grew heavy, sank into objects that had witnessed its passing. [349]
The saucer’s crack widened, not breaking but opening like a mouth ready to speak. [365]
From it rose a thread of pale light, thin as baby hair, coiling toward the sky where it braided itself into the silhouette of a child not yet old enough to ask why her mother had left. [398]
The cartomancer’s throat closed with the choking beauty of seeing what she had lost made visible. [415]
She reached for the thread, but her fingers passed through it, scattering droplets of luminescence that fell back into the clouds like reversed rain. [442]
The cards fluttered from her hands, arranging themselves in a circle around the saucer, each face showing a moment she had traded away: the first laugh, the first tooth, the first time her daughter would say “mama” to an empty room. [485]
She understood then that lost time did not accumulate in places but in absences, hollows shaped like the space between a mother’s arms and the child she never held long enough. [525]
The tablecloth stirred, its traced hands glowing faintly, and she saw her own outline beside the ghost-print of a tiny palm she had yet to guide. [553]
With trembling fingers, she unfastened the final clasp of her regret, letting it spill across the glade like ink dissolving in water. [580]
The thread of light thickened, weaving itself into the cloth until the crack in the saucer sealed, not healed but accepted, a scar that would remember the wound. [612]
She stood, the tablecloth folded carefully around the saucer, and descended through clouds that no longer felt like loss but like the soft exhale of a sleeping world. [649]
Below, her daughter stirred in her crib, dreaming of hands that had always been there, tracing circles on her back through the fabric of time itself. [680]
The cartomancer stepped into the nursery just as the first birthday candle was lit, its flame reflecting in the saucer now whole enough to hold the future she had carried home. [718]
She pressed her palm to the tablecloth, adding the final outline beside her daughter’s tiny hand, the two prints overlapping like a promise that time, once lost, could still be found in the spaces we choose to fill with love. [774]
