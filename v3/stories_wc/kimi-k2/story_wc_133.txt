The island rose only at low tide now, jagged black wings of basalt cutting the violet dawn like an old wound reopened. [23]
Ishka clutched her elbow with paint-smeared fingers, asleep on her feet yet wide-eyed in the dull repetitive ache of someone who had forgotten how to dream. [40]
Stone gulls wheeled overhead, screaming the way colors scream when squeezed too hard, and the smell of salt-slick rust reminded her that every mineral once swam through somebody’s blood. [69]
Below the waterline, last night’s shards of painted glass bedded themselves with mussel shells, waiting, she thought, for the same moon to give them back their shine. [93]
When amber glinted in the wet sand—real amber, box-rect and old-fashioned, clasped by a brass brooch—she knelt without pausing, as if her legs remembered a prayer her lips no longer dared to voice. [124]
Sunlight wobbled through it like breath caught mid-sob, trapping the dulled silhouette of a beetle and, deeper, the dusty memory of honey. [145]
Ishka remembered touching something similar on her mother’s collar years before the Wars boiled the coasts into prophecy. [167]
The brooch was cold but not empty; rather it vibrated with the hush-hush of converging timelines, the quiet awful certainty that now and then had just folded into one another like crumpled paper. [200]
She felt her sleepless years pull toward that pulse—her insomnia was never emptiness but a surplus of meaning too sharp to rest against. [230]
Footsteps approached, crunching barnacles. [238]
The stranger wore a torn greatcoat the color of boiled seaweed and a hunger more articulate than any face. [259]
He carried neither gun nor satchel, only a spiral of rainwater dripping from his sleeve no matter how clear the sky. [285]
Ishka stood up; the action was simple, but her muscles performed it with the solemnity of a verdict. [310]
Their eyes met the way two mirrors reluctantly agree they are the same person. [330]
“Trade,” he said, voice roughened by dusted stars. [342]
From his pocket he drew a folded canvas no larger than a postcard, its surface glazed with colors she had never mixed though she had wasted oceans trying. [370]
The image showed this precise beach yet lifetimes calmer, children skipping between tide pools that rippled with lantern fish instead of shrapnel. [404]
Under their laughter, faint silver letters spelled “Tomorrow, maybe.” [425]
Ishka’s chest squeezed, parsing promise from graffiti. [439]
“You sleep?” she asked wryly, earnest as flint. [449]
“Only in pieces,” he answered, “like everyone after the wars; we lend our dreams to keep the planet breathing.” [474]
He noticed the brooch’s gleam; longing passed over his face like cloud shadow, yet need kept slack. [496]
Ishka turned the brooch once, feeling its weight sketch a small sun in her palm. [519]
She had come to the island to thresh meaning from experience, believing that if she painted every lesion of light the sea exposed, coherence would crawl from the colors when they dried. [563]
But the canvas promised coherence already cooked, a painless gift. [582]
Rain began, thin needles her insomnia usually counted like rosary. [597]
The stranger’s feet left dark trails mirroring the rainfall as if gravity itself were pliable in his wake. [621]
Ishka followed those trails without decision; stepping where he stepped filled her lungs with iron thunder and the taste of unspoken treaty. [648]
At the island’s edge, water tongued the cracked causeway stones, impatient. [667]
They faced each other, transaction sealed by storm. [678]
She handed over the brooch; amber heat left her skin reluctantly. [692]
He gave her the folded tomorrow, gentle as replacing a bird’s fallen feather. [709]
Neither spoke; gratitude tasted like brine. [717]
As tide flooded back, dunes becoming ghosts, Ishka opened the canvas against the rain. [736]
Colors bled, but not away; they entered her eyes like slow sunrise after years of sodium dusk. [758]
Somewhere behind her eyelids, the beetle inside the amber crawled a single step and rested, satisfied. [781]
The painter finally closed her sleepless eyes, listening to the hush-hush of water folding over the island until last night and the next tomorrow sounded exactly the same. [816]
