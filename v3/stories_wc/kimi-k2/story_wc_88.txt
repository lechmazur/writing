The procedure left me a clean slate, but the slate still smelled faintly of gunpowder and regret. [21]  
I carried the baseball signed by a time traveler the way other people carry scars—tight in the palm, hidden until the moment it mattered. [43]  
Its stitches glowed the same pale green as the underground bioluminescent lake that waited beneath the city, a place I’d once used as a dumping ground for bodies. [75]  
After the procedure, memories were supposed to stay gone, yet the lake’s light tugged at something the surgeons couldn’t cauterize. [104]  
I unfolded yesterday’s newspaper and began reading between the lines the way an archaeologist reads dust. [137]  
The margins spelled out coordinates, half-finished names, and a single phrase: “Find the delicately robust heart of the labyrinth.” [171]  
I knew the phrase; I’d written it, years ago, on the wall of a cell where a kid begged for his mother. [199]  
Empathy had been the first thing I sold, then the first thing I stole back. [221]  
The baseball warmed, reacting to the ink like a compass needle. [244]  
I descended through maintenance shafts and forgotten subway tunnels until the air tasted of moss and old apologies. [276]  
The lake opened before me, wide as a cathedral nave, its ceiling dripping constellations of plankton. [304]  
A stone causeway split the water, branching and re-branching into a labyrinth of choices, each path paved with headlines I recognized. [340]  
One read “Local Philanthropist Vanishes”; another, “Time Traveler Pitches Perfect Game, Disappears.” [371]  
I stepped onto the first stone, and the baseball pulsed, guiding me left, then right, then doubling back, as if ashamed of the route. [408]  
Every choice echoed with a voice I’d silenced: the kid, the mother, the philanthropist who’d tried to pay ransom and ended up another headline. [450]  
The path narrowed; the walls of living stone pressed close, their glow dimming whenever I hesitated. [478]  
I realized the labyrinth wasn’t built to trap me but to teach me the weight of every turn I’d once taken without thinking. [514]  
At the center stood a small island, and on it a single newspaper vending machine, rusted yet delicately robust, its glass face cracked like old ice. [557]  
Inside lay a fresh edition dated tomorrow. [572]  
The headline: “Amnesiac Returns Baseball, Saves Drowning Child.” [595]  
I understood the machine was the heart the margins had spoken of, a mechanical oracle that printed futures only if someone cared enough to read. [635]  
I dropped the baseball into the coin slot; the machine swallowed it with a satisfied clunk. [662]  
Water stirred behind me; the lake began to rise along the causeway, sealing off every wrong path, leaving only the straight line back to daylight. [704]  
I walked it slowly, feeling the first unprogrammed emotion bloom in the hollow where cruelty had lived. [739]  
The bioluminescence followed me up the shafts, clinging to my clothes like pollen, a witness I couldn’t shake. [772]  
When I surfaced, the city above was the same grid of sirens and neon, but the newspaper in my hand now carried a different headline: “Unknown Man Rescues Family from Fire.” [818]  
I hadn’t set the fire; I’d simply pulled them out, the way the time traveler had once pitched a perfect game and vanished, leaving only the ball. [863]  
The empathy I’d come to kindle was no blazing torch, just a small, steady flame—delicately robust, enough to read the next line, and the next, until the past ran out of pages. [916]  
I folded the paper, tucked it under my arm, and started walking, a journey measured not in miles but in margins. [956]  
Somewhere beneath the city, the lake dimmed, satisfied, waiting for the next seeker with a dirty past and a clean slate. [993]
