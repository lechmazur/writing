In the amber grotto at dusk, where the air itself seemed to glow like molten resin, the counterfeit emotion dealer known only as Vale arranged her wares on a slab of petrified sap. [34]  
Each vial shimmered with distilled feeling—joy that had never been earned, grief borrowed from strangers, nostalgia for places that never existed. [50]  
She worked with professionally thorough grace, labeling every flask with half truths: “Mother’s first embrace (approximate),” “Triumph at sunrise (edited for clarity).” [70]  
Between the vials she laid a single fragrance chemist’s blotter petal, its surface porous as memory, waiting to absorb the final note of tonight’s transaction. [88]  
The buyer, a silent silhouette in a charcoal coat, watched from the grotto’s mouth where dusk’s last light dripped like honey. [104]  
Vale sensed the buyer’s mood through static electricity; the faint crackle against her fingertips told her anticipation laced with dread, a perfect solvent for the compound she intended to sell. [125]  
She spoke with affectionate detachment, the tone of a physician discussing weather. [138]  
“You wish to feel understood without the inconvenience of being known,” she said, lifting a pale lilac vial. [155]  
The buyer nodded, and Vale allowed herself half a smile, the expression itself a forgery she had practiced in mirrors. [173]  
She tipped the vial; a ribbon of counterfeit warmth spilled onto the blotter petal, which drank it like a tongue tasting a lie. [192]  
At once the grotto’s resinous walls began to hum, resonating with the emotion now diffusing into the air. [208]  
This was the moment Vale lived for: as the transformation completes, when synthetic empathy subsumes the client’s native defenses and insight fuses with empathy whether the heart consents or not. [232]  
Yet tonight the static whispered something new—a tremor of recognition from the buyer that echoed back into Vale’s own carefully insulated nerves. [252]  
Startled, she pressed two fingers to the blotter petal, grounding herself through its damp surface. [267]  
The half truths she sold were supposed to stay outside the skin, polite visitors never invited in. [283]  
Instead, the buyer’s suppressed longing leaked through the static, threading into Vale’s chest like ivy through cracked stone. [300]  
She realized, with professionally thorough horror, that her own practiced detachment was dissolving. [316]  
The grotto darkened; dusk exhaled its final copper breath. [327]  
Vale tried to seal the vial, but the blotter petal had already absorbed more than its share, swelling like a heart learning to beat. [345]  
The buyer stepped closer, and Vale saw her own reflection in the woman’s eyes—eyes that knew the difference between authentic sorrow and the echo sold in bottles. [367]  
“I don’t want your product,” the buyer said softly. [378]  
“I want the formula for how you survive without it.” [389]  
The question struck Vale harder than accusation; it carried no static, only a clean, unbearable curiosity. [405]  
She had built her life on the premise that feelings could be curated, portioned, priced. [421]  
Now, as the transformation completes, she felt her own counterfeit skins begin to slough. [436]  
The blotter petal pulsed between them, saturated with half truths that suddenly weighed more than the amber walls. [454]  
Vale lifted it, and the buyer mirrored the gesture, palms hovering inches apart. [468]  
Static arced—a violet filament—binding their nerve endings across the charged air. [482]  
Through that filament Vale sensed the buyer’s grief over a brother lost to war, a grief Vale had once bottled and labeled “Noble Sorrow (vintage).” [504]  
She tasted the bitterness of her own theft, the way she had skimmed the surface of someone else’s abyss and sold it as souvenir. [525]  
Affectionate detachment fractured; what rushed in was neither affection nor detachment but a raw, unedited ache. [544]  
The blotter petal, unable to hold the overflow, began to dissolve, releasing every half truth it had absorbed back into the grotto’s glowing dusk. [565]  
Vale felt the emotions subsumes her defenses, not as invasion but as reclamation. [580]  
Insight fused with empathy at last, and she understood the price she had never listed on any label: to feel truly with another is to lose the privilege of distance. [605]  
She reached across the remaining static and took the buyer’s hand, no longer dealer or client but two flawed instruments finally tuned to the same key. [
