Nadia pressed her palms against the thin wire of the orchard gate, feeling its cold breath even before she crouched under the first crooked peach limb. [21]  
In the cursed grove clinging to the cliff’s lip, every branch rasped like a saw and every fruit hissed like steam; the locals—the ones still breathing—had voted her reluctant caretaker after her grandfather vanished on the final pruning day of autumn. [48]  
She told herself she stayed only long enough to pick the one small nut that every season produced, the single seed that promised release from the orchard’s grip. [71]  
The cliffside labyrinth beneath her rust-eaten orchard stretched wider each year, corridors of shale and lingering salt sculpted by wind and the offhand exact footfalls of whatever parts of her family hadn’t yet turned to stone. [110]  
Mechanical birds, plated in tarnished copper, darted above the passages, their wings clicking like typewriters as they discarded forgotten blueprints of the labyrinth’s next shifting. [145]  
Those wing-clattered diagrams fluttered down like exhausted leaves; Nadia gathered them because everyone forgot things here, including how to leave. [179]  
Tonight, before the night frost forms and seals the root-stones into permanent silence, she must assemble a path out—leave impressions without touching, convincing the wind itself to carry ink of safety for the two hikers she had heard whimpering below yesterday at dusk. [245]  
One print showed a spiral staircase ending in a black smear; another depicted an orchard only drawn backward, its hanging fruit underground feeding vines of skeleton leaves. [300]  
In the center of the latest lost map floated a tiny circle labeled simply NUT, reminding her it was time to pluck this year’s offering from the gnarled tree whose roots burrowed into the cliff like guilty prayers. [345]  
Twilight curled the sky the color of moldy lace as Nadia climbed the highest terrace; she touched nothing, yet the branch sagged in acknowledgment, raining down the single walnut sealed in pearl varnish. [395]  
Holding it felt like cupping a dropped heartbeat—still alive, still waiting to be needed. [423]  
She cracked the shell along its unnatural seam and tucked the tucked kernel behind her ear, more compass than seed. [450]  
The birds swooped low, their clockwork eyes pinning her shadow to dust. [470]  
She knelt, laid out the forgotten blueprints in a fan matching cliff fractures overhead, tracing each line with the nut’s oil until they flashed and rearranged themselves into an unbroken corridor that glowed a graceless beauty—ugly, crooked, but wide enough for two souls. [540]  
Then she whispered, “Walk here, gently, nearly not at all,” and the wind obeyed, plastering the decision into the rock face like memory. [577]  
Below her, the hikers’ lantern flickered, its glass stained the same green as unripe peaches—Nadia guided them with silence, letting the nut’s oiled track shimmer just enough to steer their feet onto the temporary bridge. [630]  
The birds grew frenetic, raking spirals overhead, but she had spoken to them in clicks the day she inherited the orchard: touch them and they calcify, so instead she promised them the unplanted kernel once frost had come. [687]  
They hovered, uncertain cogs, then drifted aside. [704]  
Nadia watched the hikers cross the phantom ramp, their silhouettes soft as wet charcoal before dissolving into the safety of distant pine—shadows now where fear had been. [750]  
Frost rings shook the branches; the nut in her fist cracked open of its own accord, releasing a thin bluish smoke that smelled like winter ovens. [783]  
She exhaled the last of her grandfather’s unfinished works, turned her back on the cursed orchard, and walked down the cliffside she had never once touched, leaving impressions everywhere behind her like footprints carved from moonlight. [818]
