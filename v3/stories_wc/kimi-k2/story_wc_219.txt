The luminous skeptic, Dr. Mara Voss, pressed her palm to the rainwashed tower wall and felt the bronze quiet of spring seep into her skin. [21]
She had come after making first contact with the off-world envoy whose language tasted like copper and regret. [33]
Inside her coat pocket the fly amber—an insect suspended in resin older than recorded history—clicked softly, as though impatient. [48]
The tower had once been a pilgrimage site for those who believed the sculpture path spiraling away from its base could lead them to revelation. [69]
Now ivy strangled the statues and the path was known only by dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path, prints that appeared overnight and vanished by dusk. [93]
Mara, academically rebellious to the marrow, had dismissed the stories as mass hallucination until the envoy showed her a hologram of the same prints forming on a moon of Tau Ceti. [123]
That coincidence was the catalyst for this artificial pilgrimage: a journey staged for data, not devotion. [141]
She followed the prints clockwise, noting how each heel strike overlapped the next like a cipher. [158]
The bronze quiet deepened; even the spring rain fell without sound, coating the marble faces of forgotten saints in liquid metal light. [181]
At the third statue—a weeping angel whose eyes had been worn smooth—Mara knelt and scraped a fleck of dust into a vial. [207]
The fly amber vibrated, tugging the seam of her pocket toward the tower. [221]
She understood then that the object was not a relic but a compass calibrated to longing. [239]
Her motivation sharpened: to understand the chemistry of homecoming, she must decode what drew living things back to origins they had never known. [266]
The prints began to converge, narrowing from a spiral into a single line that pointed to the tower’s eastern door. [287]
Mara hesitated; artificial pilgrimage felt suddenly less like experiment and more like surrender. [305]
Yet the bronze quiet promised no judgment, only witness. [317]
She stepped inside. [320]
The interior smelled of wet stone and ozone, as if lightning had recently argued with the floor. [340]
A circle of footprints ringed the base of a cracked obsidian plinth where no rain could reach. [360]
Mara set the fly amber on the plinth; its glow intensified, projecting the insect’s shadow as a constellation. [381]
The constellation rotated, aligning with grooves in the floor that matched the dusty prints outside. [401]
She realized the tower was a catalyst, converting footsteps into resonance, resonance into signal. [420]
The envoy had not lied: pilgrims were broadcasting, not receiving. [433]
Mara’s academically rebellious heart quickened; she had come to debunk and instead discovered a transmitter older than any language. [456]
She placed her own boot into a print, feeling the stone warm beneath her sole. [474]
The fly amber flared, and for an instant she tasted copper and regret—the envoy’s farewell. [493]
Data streamed across her retinal display: molecular signatures of every pilgrim who had stood here, their longing rendered as isotopic ratios. [522]
Among them she found her own childhood home, the scent of her mother’s garden after rain, the exact weight of sunlight on a Sunday afternoon. [552]
Homecoming, she saw, was not geography but resonance, a chemical echo the tower amplified until it crossed stars. [578]
The bronze quiet lifted; spring rain resumed its ordinary patter against stone. [594]
Mara collected the fly amber, now dim, and stepped back onto the overgrown sculpture path. [612]
The prints ahead were fresh, leading away, inviting her to add her own dusty signature to the spiral. [632]
She did not follow them. [639]
Instead she began to map the tower’s resonance frequencies, determined to teach the envoy—and herself—that understanding was a truer pilgrimage than arrival. [673]
Night settled; the luminous skeptic worked by the soft glow of the fly amber, her rebellion transformed into stewardship. [697]
When dawn came, the bronze quiet returned, but it no longer felt like silence. [715]
It felt like the moment before a question, the chemistry of homecoming distilled into a single, patient breath. [740]
