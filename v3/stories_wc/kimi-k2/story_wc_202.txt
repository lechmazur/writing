In the alchemist’s market strung high above city rooftops, the air smelled always of solder and star-anise. [19]
Between its swaying plank-ways, the between-worlds translator drifted, coat pockets clattering with lighthouse lens fragments he had traded for forgotten verbs. [35]
Each shard, a sliver of the old beacon off Cradle Cape, glowed elusively tangible only when moonlight struck it at the precise slant of memory. [54]
Tonight, the largest shard throbbed, because intuition told him the hour had arrived to unfasten the binding his ancestors had knotted into pigment. [76]
Centuries earlier, the first translator, a girl no older than eleven, had hidden the city's entire oral history beneath brushstrokes in market stall signs. [99]
Ever since, the tale survived only in layered glazes and flecks of ultramarine, waiting for a reader who could read the space between colors. [123]
The present translator had walked this scaffold bazaar since childhood, memorizing every creak, yet only now sensed where childhood ended and now began. [150]
That razor-thin seam felt like an eternal instant trapped inside a prism. [167]
He knelt under Ilya's oil of the spice-runner airships, palm warming the lighthouse fragment against the canvas. [189]
With the lens, he angled lamplight until a hidden cartouche unfolded: cobalt coils spelled the name Tarek, spice-runner, erased from ledgers for loving another man. [223]
The detail stung the translator’s throat; he heard Tarek’s laugh echo across alleys where love had once dared speak its own grammar. [246]
He moved to the next stall, past jars of quicksilver and dried tongues, until a still life of pomegranates bled the date 1873 under crimson glaze. [274]
There, crimson resolved into miniature sailors swallowed by red tides while city councils toasted above them. [295]
He noted each face, honoring overlooked histories with whispered repetition, promising the dead they were still spoken. [321]
With every revelation, the fragment cooled, its internal fire guttering as stories migrated to his pulse. [342]
At the seventh painting—a shepherd above clouds—he discovered the final knot: two children holding hands across a crevasse labeled “Future”. [368]
Guided solely by the anchors of intuition, he licked his thumb and traced the bridge until pigment lifted, revealing a spiral verse beginning with the word Remember. [398]
As pigment dissolved, the market’s lanterns flickered in synch, acknowledging histories stepping free of their hidden cells. [424]
Under that sudden darkness, the translator felt the eternal instant widen, letting past and present breathe the same breath of cedar smoke and brine. [453]
The largest lighthouse shard went dull; its duty complete, it became mere cracked glass. [474]
He pocketed it still; nothing that once held starlight should become ordinary trash. [495]
All around, merchants stirred as if waking from a collective dream, unaware anything sacred had passed, yet somehow lighter. [522]
The translator stood, coat now heavier with names instead of secrets. [540]
He took one step beyond the last plank, where the city’s true sky swallowed the moon. [562]
There he spoke aloud every recovered syllable. [571]
Wind carried the litany downward to avenues and river wharves that had never known their own names, until the whole lower city shimmered like a tide of answered prayers. [606]
In that shimmer, the translator felt childhood lift away like steam off tea. [628]
Yet he did not mourn its departure; memory had merely changed vessels. [648]
He pressed his lips once to the spent fragment, a kiss honoring every lighthouse that once kept lovers from rocky shores. [674]
Then, still walking the high market suspended between rooftops, he turned toward the next stall, where a new painting waited, drying under the dawn. [705]
Night trades to day, traders rearrange, yet somewhere a hidden detail prepares to unfasten tomorrow for whoever listens beyond the visible. [734]
Word by word, color by color, the between-worlds translator continues, because honoring overlooked histories is the only map that keeps sky and city from drifting irretrievably apart. [770]
And the eternal instant, having welcomed the past, now opens again, as wide and patient as any sea that ever waited for speech. [790]
