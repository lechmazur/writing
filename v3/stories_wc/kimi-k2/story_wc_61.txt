In the nebula garden, where petals of ionized gas drifted like slow-motion snow across the quiet sigh of falling petals, the otherworldly sentimentalist knelt beside a broken calculating machine gear half-buried in stardust. [42]  
Its teeth still spun, though no engine drove them, approximating infinity in tiny, futile clicks that echoed through the vacuum like sonar pinging against memory. [64]  
The sentimentalist—whose name had been forgotten by every archive but whose grief remained perfectly preserved—traced the gear with a finger of coherent light, feeling the generational patterns etched into its alloy: each scratch a century, each dent a daughter’s rebellion, each polish a father’s apology. [94]  
She had come here by transit through the petal streams, riding the pressure of photons the way whales once rode thermals in ancient seas, because the garden was the only place left where light could be shared without using fire. [125]  
Fire had been the first betrayal: her mother igniting the family star to keep the colony warm, her grandmother torching the census records to hide the debt, her child sparking the rebellion that turned every lantern into a signal flare. [158]  
Now only the troubling serenity of the nebula remained, violet and rose and bruise-blue, humming with the same lullaby that had hushed three generations to sleep before the alarms began. [185]  
She lifted the gear and pressed it to her sternum, letting its rhythm sync with the pulse of her own luminous heart, a heart that had never known combustion yet still felt the scorch of legacy. [215]  
The gear’s teeth caught on the fabric of her robe, tugging threads loose that unraveled into equations describing every orbit her bloodline had failed to close. [240]  
She whispered to the gear as if it were an infant, promising to break the pattern, to scatter the light without burning anything down, but the gear only clicked faster, approximating infinity with increasing desperation. [270]  
Across the garden, another petal fell—a cloud of neon oxygen collapsing into silence—and the sentimentalist understood the transit had not been hers alone. [295]  
The gear had traveled too, passed hand to burning hand, mother to daughter to granddaughter, each bearer adding a notch until the notches became a map of every escape route that ended back at the same sorrow. [325]  
She set the gear on a bed of plasma moss, where it continued its tiny revolution, and began to sing, a song without words, a modulation of pure frequency that rose like sonar pinging through the nebula’s hush. [355]  
The petals answered, brightening, rearranging themselves into constellations that spelled out apologies in languages extinct before Earth had cooled. [378]  
One by one, the lights of her ancestors stepped out from the gas—mother a corona of regret, grandmother a filament of defiance, child a spark still learning the shape of no—and they gathered around the gear, listening. [410]  
She sang them the story of the garden, of transit without fire, of light offered as gift instead of weapon, and with each note the gear slowed, its approximation of infinity gentling into acceptance. [440]  
When the last petal settled, the gear stopped entirely, teeth aligned in a perfect circle that reflected the nebula’s troubling serenity like a mirror polished by centuries of remorse. [470]  
The ancestors dimmed, not vanishing but folding themselves into the petals, becoming part of the drift that would carry their light to distant nurseries where new stars might learn gentler myths. [500]  
The sentimentalist remained kneeling, palms open, feeling the warmth that was not heat but recognition, the shared luminosity of having finally broken the generational pattern without breaking the bond. [530]  
She left the gear where it lay, a monument to calculation that had learned to rest, and stepped back into the petal stream, her body dispersing into photons that would seed other gardens across the quiet sigh of falling petals. [560]  
Somewhere, a child in a future nebula would find a gear that no longer spun, would feel the echo of a song without fire, and would understand that light can be inherited without being ignited. [590]  
The sentimentalist’s last thought, carried on the sonar pinging of drifting petals, was a simple equation: grief plus time divided by shared light equals the closest thing to infinity a family can reach. [620]  
And so the nebula garden kept its troubling serenity, petals falling forever, each one a soft transit of memory, each one a promise that the next generation would not need to burn to be seen. [650]  
In the hush between pulses, the gear gave a final, contented click, as if to say the calculation was complete, the pattern rewritten, the light
