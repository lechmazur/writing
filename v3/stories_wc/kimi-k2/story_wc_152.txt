The cobalt observatory stood alone on the cliff, its copper dome tarnished to the same bruised blue as the autumn sky. [21]
Inside, Mira bent over her embroidery hoop, silver thread trembling like starlight between her fingers. [34]
Each stitch mapped a quadrant of the galaxy she had never seen, yet knew by heart. [47]
She worked by the flame of the eternal candle, a tongue of fire that never shortened, never smoked, only whispered. [65]
The candle had been lit the day the observatory was founded; legend claimed it would burn until the last secret was spoken aloud. [85]
Mira’s task was to finish the chart before the coup that everyone pretended not to foresee. [100]
She embroidered conspiracies as constellations: a duke’s smile became a crooked dagger, a general’s oath a tightening noose. [120]
To any visitor she appeared a fool, humming lullabies to her needle, pricking herself and laughing at the blood like rubies. [138]
Yet every drop that fell onto the cloth was a cipher, every off-key note a warning. [152]
She disguised wisdom as foolishness because the walls had ears carved from listening stone. [166]
The echoed silence of the empty halls pressed against her eardrums like deep water. [180]
She listened for unheard stories in that silence, the tremors of plots not yet spoken. [194]
Tonight the candle’s flame leaned east, though no wind stirred. [206]
Mira understood: the conspirators would synchronize their uprising at the third moonset. [220]
She had until then to unravel the pattern she herself had stitched. [232]
She lifted the cloth to the flame, not to burn but to read. [243]
In the wavering light, adjacent possibilities unfolded: threads loosened, re-formed, revealed hidden corridors between stars. [261]
One constellation resembled the observatory’s own floor plan; another traced the secret tunnel beneath the cliff. [278]
She saw the duke entering at dawn disguised as a pilgrim, the general arriving later with a gift of poisoned wine. [298]
The candle’s flame brightened, as if eager to betray its keepers. [310]
Mira began to unstitch, pulling silver paths into new trajectories. [322]
Each removed thread left a ghost image, a memory of what might have been. [336]
She worked through the hush of autumn night, leaves scraping the dome like dry wings. [351]
Footsteps approached—soft, conspiratorial—but paused when her song faltered into a childish giggle. [367]
The intruder retreated, reassured by the fool’s mask she wore. [379]
She embroidered faster now, not galaxies but escape routes, stitching lies that would lead the duke’s men into the tide. [398]
The candle’s flame danced, casting her shadow across the wall like a puppet confessing. [413]
She pricked her finger again, deliberately, and let three drops fall: one for the king, one for the child heir, one for the city that slept unaware. [437]
The blood soaked into the cloth, blooming into a red star at the chart’s center. [451]
She folded the fabric so the star aligned with the candle’s wick, a beacon for anyone who knew how to read fire. [470]
Then she placed the chart beneath the observatory’s great lens, where dawn’s first light would ignite the beacon and scatter the conspirators’ shadows. [493]
She sat back, humming again, the eternal candle steady now, satisfied. [507]
Outside, the first frost silvered the cliff; inside, echoed silence deepened, waiting for the unheard stories of morning. [525]
Mira closed her eyes and listened. [532]
She heard the duke’s carriage wheels grinding the coastal road, the general’s boots on the spiral stair, the faint click of a poison vial against a ring. [556]
She heard, too, the softer sound of her own heart keeping time with the candle. [571]
When the third moonset bled into dawn, the observatory’s dome would open like an eye. [588]
The chart would blaze, the conspiracies unravel, and the city would wake to a sky rearranged by a fool who had never spoken a wise word aloud. [615]
Mira smiled, small and secret, and began a new constellation: a candle flame cradled in an open hand. [635]
She stitched it with invisible thread, a gift for the next embroiderer who would need to listen for unheard stories after the next coup. [658]
The eternal candle flickered once, as if nodding. [670]
In its echoed silence, Mira heard the future begin. [680]
