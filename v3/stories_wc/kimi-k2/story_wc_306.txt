The conscience-for-hire arrived at the breezy lighthouse before the sun had decided to rise, boots crunching over salt-stiff grass after the campfire’s last spark died. [30]
Inside, the spiral stair smelled of kerosene and yesterday’s guilt; she climbed anyway, coat snapping like a black flag. [45]
At the lantern room she found her client: a teenage keeper whose eyes flickered between pleading and pride, fingers curled around a hollow mirror shard that reflected nothing but the dark. [70]
“I need you to unhook certainty from my chest,” the boy whispered, voice sincerely insincere, the way only someone terrified of being known can manage. [90]
She nodded, routine as tide, and spread the cloak of doubt across the railing—fabric woven from every maybe she had ever collected, weightless yet impossible to fold. [115]
Its hem hissed, drinking the wind, turning the glass panes into faint question marks. [128]
First rule of the trade: never wear the cloak yourself; second rule: never promise answers. [145]
She broke both by asking his name. [150]
“Elias,” he said, then immediately, “or maybe I borrowed it.” [160]
She recorded the hesitation on a wax tablet; conscience is billed by the gram. [175]
Elias lifted the hollow mirror shard, letting dawn’s first bruised light pass through the void where silver once clung. [195]
“Every morning it shows me a future that cancels itself before lunch,” he confessed. [210]
She studied the shard, noting how its edges were polished by obsessive thumbs, and understood the forecast he feared was already here. [230]
To welcome nuance into certainty, one must first admit the lighthouse is also a cage of bright predictions. [250]
So she set about deciphering wind chime selections strung along the catwalk—shell, bone, rusted knife, sea glass—each clapper a syllable in a language older than verdicts. [280]
She listened for the gaps between notes, the small silences where forgiveness might hide. [295]
Elias watched, shoulders folding inward, protected vulnerability armored by sarcasm. [308]
The cloak of doubt lifted, kite-like, almost leaving her hands; she gripped tighter, feeling its threads tug toward the boy as if recognizing a new host. [330]
“Tell me the last thing you were sure of,” she said. [340]
“That my father would come back,” he answered, then laughed, a sound like a pane cracking. [355]
The hollow mirror shard pulsed, drinking the laugh, still reflecting nothing. [367]
She placed the wax tablet at his feet; the inscribed hesitations glowed faintly, fireflies of almost-truth. [382]
“Step onto these,” she instructed. [387]
He did, barefoot, toes curling around the soft wax, each letter rising to kiss his skin. [402]
The conscience-for-hire began to unhook the metal buttons of his certainty one by one—no blood, only a rain of small metallic clicks joining the wind chimes. [425]
With each button, the cloak of doubt grew heavier, sleeves lengthening toward him like welcoming arms. [440]
Elias trembled, yet leaned forward; the desire to be rid of sureness can be as fierce as any gospel. [455]
When the final button fell, she caught the cloak mid-air and draped it over his narrow shoulders. [470]
It fit perfectly, seams sealing with a sigh. [477]
For a moment he stood dual: boy and question mark, edges flickering. [490]
Then the hollow mirror shard flared, not with image but with sound—every wind chime striking at once, a chord unresolved. [510]
She recognized the signal: transaction complete. [517]
Elias exhaled, and his breath emerged as a small gray moth that circled the lantern twice before escaping into the pale morning. [535]
He looked at her, eyes now soft as wet sand. [544]
“I still don’t know anything,” he said, voice steady for the first time. [558]
“Good,” she replied, packing the wax tablet, the empty buttons, and the last of her own certainties into a velvet pouch. [575]
She left him there, cloak fluttering like a second, more honest skin, mirror shard quiet in his open palm. [595]
Descending the spiral, she felt the lighthouse diminish behind her, a question that had learned to live without an answer. [615]
Outside, the sun finally breached the horizon, scattering coins of light across the sea, each wave arriving unsure whether to break or keep rolling. [640]
She did not look back; her job was to install doors, not to watch them close. [655]
Yet in her chest a new weight shifted—one button of borrowed certainty she had accidentally pocketed, warm as a guilty heartbeat. [675]
She considered throwing it into the surf, but nuance, once invited, refuses to leave. [690]
Instead she pinned it inside her coat, a private lighthouse of doubt to guide her to the next campfire whose sparks were almost gone. [710]
The wind carried the faint after-echo of chimes, a map written in erasure, and she followed, sincerely insincere, protector of the fragile cracks through which the world remakes itself. [740]
At the dunes she paused, letting the breeze finish the sentence she would never speak, and walked on, welcoming every unfinished color the dawn dared to offer. [765]
