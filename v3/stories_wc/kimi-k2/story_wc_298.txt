The catacomb orchard breathed with the hush of half-lit corridors, roots of pale fruit trees threading through ribcages like stitches meant to mend what death had torn open. [34]
A reckless idealist named Lira stepped between the bones, lantern swinging, her shadow leaping across skulls as if arguing with them. [50]
She carried a single burned tarot card—the Tower—its edges curled black, the painted lightning scorched away so only the falling figures remained, forever mid-plunge. [70]
Tonight she would barter destinies the way seamstresses barter thread, trading futures to patch holes in the soul she had torn wider with every impulsive promise. [90]
The air smelled of bruised apples and wet limestone; somewhere water dripped in a rhythm like slow applause. [108]
Lira knelt where a sapling had split a pelvis, roots cradling the bone as fiercely gentle as a mother who knows the child will never wake. [128]
From her coat she drew a pouch of silver pins and fragments of mirror, tools for inlaying meaning everywhere the underworld had left blank. [148]
She pressed the burned tarot against the trunk; bark hissed, accepting the card as if it were a graft. [163]
“One destiny for another,” she whispered, voice dusky with resolve. [175]
The half-lit corridors brightened a shade, lanterns responding to the oath. [186]
A figure stepped from behind a column—Ardan, the keeper of the orchard, face half shadow, half mercy. [201]
“You trammel the living with the debts of the dead,” he warned, fingers brushing the roots that snaked around his boots. [218]
Lira met his gaze, fierce gentleness sparking between them like struck flint. [230]
“My soul has exits where entrances should be; I mend them with futures not my own.” [245]
Ardan lifted a withered apple; inside, seeds had grown into tiny skeletons curled like question marks. [261]
“Each barter feeds the trees,” he said. [269]
“Then feed them mine,” Lira answered, pressing her palm to the bark until sap beaded like blood. [283]
The burned tarot sank deeper, card becoming cambium, image dissolving into living wood. [296]
A low wind rose, carrying whispers of every fate she had ever gambled. [308]
Roots shifted, tightening around bones, knitting femur to fibula in a cradle of living wood. [322]
Ardan watched, eyes reflecting lantern glow and something older. [333]
“Your recklessness is a graft that may take or may rot,” he murmured. [346]
Lira felt the tug inside her chest, threads of possible futures unraveling, re-weaving into the orchard’s hungry heart. [363]
She remembered the village fire she had failed to stop, the child she had pulled from flames only to lose to smoke; that hole gaped wider than any corridor here. [385]
With each heartbeat, the tree drank another tomorrow she would never live. [398]
Yet the bark beneath her hand grew warm, almost pulsing, as if grateful. [411]
Ardan placed his own palm beside hers, sharing the weight. [422]
“Fierce and gentle both,” he said, “you offer what you cannot spare.” [435]
Lanterns flickered; somewhere a root snapped a bone like a dry twig, then cradled the shards as if apologizing. [451]
Lira closed her eyes, feeling the orchard’s vast patience, its slow resolve to turn every sorrow into fruit. [467]
She saw futures branching: one where she walked away whole but empty, another where she stayed and became part root, part memory. [485]
The burned tarot had vanished entirely; in its place, a pale bud swelled, shaped like a falling tower inverted—salvation instead of ruin. [503]
“I barter not to escape but to repair,” she said, voice steady now. [517]
Ardan nodded, understanding dawning like second twilight. [526]
Together they pressed the silver pins into the trunk, inlaying constellations of meaning across the living wound. [542]
Each pin caught lantern light, scattering it into the corridors so the half-lit became wholly luminous for one breath. [559]
Bones around them stirred, not in protest but in benediction, clacking softly like wind chimes made of prayers. [575]
Lira felt the last hole in her soul close, stitched by roots that had accepted her reckless gift and returned it transformed. [593]
She stepped back, lantern steady, the dusky resolve in her eyes now shared by every shadow. [608]
Ardan handed her a single pale fruit, skin translucent enough to show seeds curled like sleeping infants. [623
