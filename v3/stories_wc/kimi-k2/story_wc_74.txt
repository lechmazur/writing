The smog lay over Old Quarter like a yellow tarp, thick enough that Lira could taste rust when she opened her mouth to breathe. [29]  
She climbed the steel rungs to her rooftop greenhouse every night at 9:17 sharp, the hour the towers dimmed as if ceding the sky to the waxing moon. [56]  
Up here the air was no cleaner, but green peppers and saffron marigolds pressed against the glass like living lanterns. [79]  
Lira had not slept in forty-two nights, though she painted until dawn, methodically hopeful that exhaustion might eventually consent to release her. [104]  
Under the moon’s pale eye she touched new pigments to canvas, chasing a memory she could not name. [130]  
One evening the wind rolled a slender tube across the workbench, bumping her ankle. [153]  
It was a calligrapher’s moon-tipped brush—bone-white handle, bristles glowing silver where lunar light kissed them. [180]  
She did not remember buying it; the city’s lost-and-found often floated upward to her, as if kindness were lighter than smog and knew where to land. [210]  
Unrolling rice paper, she meant only to test the brush, but the moment the tip touched the sheet the tool tugged her wrist like an oar. [238]  
Inkless characters flared across the page, curling into shapes she had never learned yet somehow understood. [261]  
They spelled gentle instructions for rousing strangers wrapped in sleeplessness. [280]  
Lira read them aloud, voice cracking with wonder. [295]  
The moon answered by brightening one exact degree, lighting saffron-quiet color across every leaf in the greenhouse. [318]  
At 1:03 the rooftop door moaned. [331]  
A boy maybe ten years old climbed through, hair sticking to his forehead with city grime and tears. [357]  
He carried a tin lunchbox, dented like a heart that beats too often in the dark. [380]  
He whispered that he had been sleepwalking since his mother vanished at the station, that every night the rails hummed a lost lullaby. [410]  
Lira set the lunchbox on the bench and offered the brush. [426]  
“Write what you need remembering,” she said, methodically hopeful the same way gardeners plant seeds in soil they may never see bloom. [455]  
The boy’s fingers trembled around the moon-tipped handle, yet the script that bloomed was fluent to her eyes though foreign to his mouth. [481]  
The characters read: she fed a stranger hot noodles on the night the city tasted of sulfur. [502]  
Lines of ink drifted into vapor and formed a silhouette, saffron-warm, of a woman folding the boy’s hand around disposable chopsticks. [527]  
Lira’s chest constricted—she had queued at that same stall a month back, buying soup for a girl who only owned one shoe. [552]  
The woman’s outline kissed the boy’s brow, dissolved, and left the faintest taste of soy broth in the air. [573]  
Tears polished the boy’s cheeks as his shoulders began the gentle rise and fall of real sleep. [594]  
Lira lifted him into the hammock strung between fan-palm trunks, tucking his small shoes like parentheses around his dreaming feet. [619]  
Night after night visitors found the greenhouse under the waxing moon: an elderly accountant who remembered the word for grandmother in a dialect that had died with the last train station clock, a street sweeper who recalled sharing rainwater with songbirds. [672]  
Each stranger wrote a kindness the city had almost erased, ink unfurling into holograms of touch, food, borrowed umbrellas. [701]  
Lira filled canvas after canvas with their glowing letters, daydreams sparked by moonlight layering pigment upon memory until the paintings themselves hummed. [738]  
When the moon reached fullness it hung low, a bulb ready to burst pollen of saffron quiet across the skyline. [763]  
Lira stepped back, paintbrush still raised, realizing she had not felt sleep pry at her eyes tonight, not because insomnia yielded but because the insomnia itself had proven the bridge between strangers and kindness. [790]  
At dawn the greenhouse shelves displayed canvases wet with light, each painting a dictionary of gestures no tongue had taught yet every heart spoke. [814]  
Lira sealed the final canvas, rolled them together, and set them by the greenhouse door addressed simply: “From Those Who Remember Kindness to Those Who Might Forget.” [846]  
Smog still folded the city in sour yellow fabric, but beneath it roofs gleamed with tiny awnings of reflected moonlight; somewhere a boy slept spoon-shaped hope against his chest, and the calligrapher’s moon-tipped brush rested bristles skyward, awaiting the next traveler still awake enough to rouse the kindness sleeping inside strangers.
