In the hush of a hidden sunrise, the lost soul collector stood at the lip of Echo Gorge, modestly fearless despite the thousand murmuring voices that rose from the chasm like steam. [34]  
She had no name anymore; names were the first thing she surrendered when she agreed to gather the unmoored dead. [48]  
Yet one fragment refused to settle: a single crocodile's tooth, ivory veined with black, that clacked against the copper vials in her coat whenever she moved. [68]  
The tooth had arrived with the ghost of a river boatman who, before dissolving, confessed that he had laughed only once in life—at the sight of his own severed foot sliding across the deck like a comedic fish. [96]  
The collector had catalogued the confession, but the laughter itself escaped her nets, ricocheting through the gorge in distorted notes that sounded almost like a harp strung with moonlight. [123]  
She understood then that the gorge was a misaligned harp: basalt cliffs for frame, wind for plectrum, and every spirit a broken string humming out of tune. [147]  
To integrate that laughter into healing, she would have to pursue the echo to its source and retune the entire valley. [168]  
So she descended the narrow trail, boots scattering shards of mica that glittered like spilled starlight. [187]  
Each step triggered spectral confessions that drifted upward in ribbons of pale fire: a baker reciting the weight of every loaf he stole, a child whispering the color of the wolf that ate her shadow. [220]  
The collector listened without judgment, but her coat grew heavier, vials chiming like captive bells. [239]  
At the first bend, the crocodile's tooth began to vibrate, tugging her toward a side cave where a woman-shaped silhouette knelt, fingers plucking the air as if strumming invisible strings. [270]  
The apparition lifted her head; her eyes were hollow, yet her mouth curved in a smile that hurt to witness. [290]  
"I was the court musician," she said, voice a cracked chord. [303]  
"When the plague came, they blamed my songs and shattered my harp against these stones. [318]  
I died laughing at the absurdity—music blamed for silence." [332]  
The collector offered her palm, and the musician placed a translucent hand upon it; cold seeped through like melted silver. [354]  
Together they walked deeper, following the tooth's insistent pull. [367]  
The gorge narrowed, walls leaning inward until the sky became a blade of rose and gold. [387]  
Here the wind funneled into a single aperture, producing a note so pure it felt like grief distilled. [407]  
The collector recognized the frequency: the exact pitch of the boatman's lost laughter. [424]  
She withdrew the copper vials, uncorked them, and let the confessed sins pour out as shimmering vapor. [445]  
The musician stretched her arms, gathering the vapor into chords, weaving guilt into harmony. [463]  
Still, the laughter wavered, incomplete. [472]  
The collector pressed the crocodile's tooth into the musician's spectral palm. [485]  
Memory flared: the boatman's foot sliding, the ridiculous slap of wet flesh, the involuntary bark of mirth. [507]  
The musician laughed too, a sound like water striking hot iron, bright and brief. [525]  
That laugh rippled outward, striking the gorge walls, refracting into cascades of softer chuckles until every spirit within earshot joined. [551]  
The collector felt her own chest loosen, a knot she had carried for centuries dissolving into warm air. [574]  
Above them, the hidden sunrise spilled over the rim, igniting the mica shards so the entire gorge blazed with luminous ache. [600]  
The musician's form grew translucent, then transparent, until only the echo of her laughter remained, perfectly tuned. [625]  
The collector opened her coat; the vials were empty, the crocodile's tooth now a small white star resting at the bottom of the largest. [651]  
She climbed out of the gorge lighter than breath, modestly fearless still, but carrying a new sound: the integrated laughter of every soul she had ever gathered, humming softly behind her ribs. [700]  
At the rim she paused, turned back, and spoke the first words she had uttered in a hundred years: "Thank you for the song." [730]  
The gorge answered with a single, clear note that lingered until the sun stood fully above the world, and the day, at last, began. [760]
