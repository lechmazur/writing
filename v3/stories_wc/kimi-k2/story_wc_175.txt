In the verdant grotto above the clouds, where orchids grew like chandeliers and mist pooled like breath, the esoteric realist named Lira knelt beside a single monarch butterfly suspended in mid-molt. [34]  
Its left hindwing had torn away, leaving a translucent moth wing—smaller, duller, yet iridescent at certain angles—caught on a fern tip like a forgotten semaphore. [52]  
Lira had come during the migration of the last monarch butterfly, not to witness an ending but to honor overlooked histories written in scales and wind. [70]  
She believed every interrupted cadence—every half-finished song, every truncated dynasty—deserved a coda, however faint. [86]  
The grotto itself was transiently rooted: islands of soil clung to the caldera’s lip, anchored by vines that could release their grip at any sigh of the mountain. [104]  
Knowing this, Lira began building temporary structures as signals, weaving bamboo ribs and spider-silk guy-lines into a lattice that spelled, in the old semaphore alphabet, the word “remember.” [124]  
Each knot she tied was a syllable, each crossing a pause; the structure quivered but held, a blush of motion against the stillness. [141]  
She worked in blushing stillness, cheeks warmed by altitude and embarrassment at her own need to commemorate what the world had agreed to forget. [159]  
A sudden downdraft rattled the grotto; the monarch staggered in the air, its remaining wings beating an interrupted cadence—three strokes, silence, two strokes—before it caught an updraft and vanished into the sun. [181]  
The torn moth wing fluttered free and landed on Lira’s palm, lighter than guilt. [193]  
She studied the tiny scales: maps of vanished forests, coded pigments no longer produced by any living plant. [208]  
To anchor the memory, she knotted the moth wing into the apex of her signal tower, sealing it with a hitch that would loosen in three days’ time, when the vines planned their next drift. [228]  
The tower now resembled a question mark, or perhaps a musical rest. [239]  
Lira sat back, listening to the hush that followed the monarch’s departure. [250]  
In that hush she heard other wings—ghost generations—brushing against the grotto’s memory. [261]  
She realized her own presence was another transiently rooted note: she would leave at dusk, and the grotto would forget her scent within a week. [279]  
Yet the interrupted cadence of the monarch’s flight had been answered by her lattice, a fragile amen. [293]  
She pressed her ear to the bamboo; faint vibrations traveled the fibers, carrying rumors of distant storms and the slow grind of continents. [311]  
From her pocket she drew a spool of red thread once used to bind bureaucratic archives, histories no one had bothered to digitize. [329]  
She tied one end to the tower and the other around her wrist, a lifeline between body and testament. [343]  
The thread tightened as the grotto exhaled, reminding her that even remembrance must negotiate with gravity. [358]  
Night seeped upward from the cloud sea, dyeing the orchids indigo. [369]  
Lira lit a beeswax candle the size of a thumb and set it beneath the moth wing; the flame projected the wing’s veined shadow onto the mist, magnifying its forgotten cartography. [390]  
For the first time she noticed a second pattern: the shadow formed the outline of an ancient city whose name had been erased from every map. [408]  
Tears blurred her vision, not of grief but of recognition; the overlooked histories were not gone, only folded into smaller and smaller spaces. [427]  
She began to sing, voice barely louder than the candle’s crackle, a lullaby her grandmother claimed had been sung to migrating butterflies since before language hardened into words. [449]  
The grotto answered with a soft rustle, as if the vines were learning the melody. [461]  
At the final note, the tower trembled; one knot loosened, releasing a faint chime of bamboo. [474]  
Lira understood the signal was complete: not a monument but an invitation to witness. [486]  
She extinguished the candle, pocketed the spool, and left the red thread tied to the tower, a vein of intention in the breathing dark. [504]  
As she descended the cloud ladder, she felt the thread tug once, twice, then go slack; the grotto had accepted her offering and begun its slow forgetting. [524]  
Behind her, the moth wing caught the first starlight, shimmering like a blush on the cheek of the world. [540]
