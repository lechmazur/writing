The xenobiology research station floated above the violet clouds of Kepler-9c, its corridors humming with mechanically warm air that smelled faintly of ozone and thawed frost. [34]  
Within the hush of beating wings at rest—those of the station’s captive moth-whales suspended in zero-g tanks—Lira adjusted the magnetic nexus at twilight, a fist-sized sphere of shifting poles that glowed like a second heart in her palm. [67]  
She was the obliging sky mechanic, the one who never refused a request, yet tonight she worked alone, driven by a private urgency: to prove that time moves sideways, not forward. [94]  
Her boots clicked softly across the frost-latticed deck as she carried the nexus to the observation dome, where holographic principles shimmered in faint blue grids, mapping the moth-whales’ dream-songs into fractal equations. [127]  
Each pulse of their wings at rest left a silent echo in the air, a subdued awakening that tugged at the edge of her thoughts, reminding her of the brother she lost to linear time. [158]  
She set the nexus on its tripod, aligned it with the holographic lattice, and pulled the lever recessed into the floor. [181]  
The lever resisted, then gave with a sigh, releasing a low harmonic that vibrated through the dome’s icy warmth. [205]  
Lines of light folded inward, bending the holographic principles into a Möbius corridor, a tunnel of sideways seconds. [230]  
Lira stepped inside. [233]  
The moth-whales’ wings beat once in their sleep, and the sound became a hush again, cradling her passage. [256]  
She drifted through memories not her own: her brother laughing on a winter pier, the same pier now submerged beneath Kepler-9c’s violet storms. [285]  
Time slid sideways; she saw him older, then younger, then older again, each version turning to look at her with recognition that transcended sequence. [318]  
The mechanically warm air of the corridor followed her, a tether to the station’s present. [340]  
She reached the far end of the corridor and grasped the nexus once more, its magnetic fields aligning to her pulse like a compass finding true north. [372]  
Proof gathered in the data streaming across her wrist console: temporal drift measured laterally, not chronologically. [398]  
Yet the holographic tunnel began to collapse, the lever’s harmonic fading. [417]  
She sprinted back, boots skimming the folding light, heart racing against the subdued awakening of the moth-whales whose dreams now thrashed in agitation. [450]  
The wings beat faster, no longer at rest, shredding the hush into urgent flurries. [470]  
Lira dove through the narrowing mouth of the corridor, clutching the nexus to her chest. [490]  
She landed hard on the dome’s deck as the holographic principles dissolved into starlight. [510]  
The lever reset itself with a soft clack, sealing the breach. [526]  
Silence returned, thick and icy, yet warmed by the lingering glow of the nexus. [545]  
She opened her palm; the sphere had cooled, its poles frozen in a new configuration that spelled her brother’s name in magnetic script. [575]  
Proof complete, she thought, but the victory tasted like thawed frost. [593]  
The moth-whales settled, wings folding back into the hush of beating wings at rest, their dream-songs now threaded with her sideways grief. [622]  
Lira logged the data, tagged it “Lateral Time, Verified,” and sent it to the station’s archive. [645]  
Then she returned the nexus to its cradle, her obliging nature satisfied, her private motive met. [670]  
Outside the dome, twilight deepened into indigo, and the station’s lights flickered like low embers in an icy hearth. [695]  
She stood alone, breathing mechanically warm air, listening to the subdued awakening of possibility. [720]  
Somewhere sideways, her brother was still laughing on the pier, and the moth-whales sang of it, wings at rest, hearts in flight. [750]  
Lira smiled, a small, quiet curve that belonged neither to past nor future, but to the sideways moment she now carried inside her. [780]
