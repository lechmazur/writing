The ivy had swallowed the station whole, green tongues licking rust from the rails, and I stepped through the torn ticket window like a trespasser in my own past. [34]  
I was a truth-seeking river chronicler once, paid in coins and coffee to measure currents and record what the water confessed, but after stopping the medication the voices of the river and the voices of regret braided together until I could no longer tell them apart. [64]  
My accordion hung from my shoulder, its bellows patched with tape the color of dried blood, each strip a reminder of a song I had promised to finish and never did. [83]  
I had come to this disused railway station because the last map I trusted, the one I drew when the dosage was highest, ended here with a single penciled phrase: “forgiveness is a platform you can’t see until the train is gone.” [104]  
The air smelled of wet creosote and crushed mint; somewhere beneath the leaves a signal bell lay rusted in mid-ring, daringly methodical in its refusal to complete the note. [124]  
I walked the platform edge heel-to-toe, counting sleepers like rosary beads, letting the rhythm allude to the meter of the river I once charted, the same pulse that had steadied my hands before the pills dulled them. [148]  
On the wall of the gentlemen’s lavatory, behind a sagging door, I found the graffiti: “The water remembers every name you tried to forget—speak one aloud and the current changes.” [172]  
The words were scratched with a key or a knife, raw and uneven, yet they carried the bathroom graffiti wisdom I had traveled here to test, because if the river could forgive, then maybe I could too. [195]  
I unslung the accordion, pressed the patched bellows, and drew a chord that quivered like a trapped sparrow; the ivy shivered, leaves parting to reveal a rusted bench where I had once waited with her, the woman whose name I swallowed with the pills. [220]  
She had asked me to choose between the river and the dose, and I chose silence, letting the medication dam the flow of stories until even the map references blurred into fog. [242]  
Now, without the buffer, memory returned like floodwater, and I played the accordion softly, daringly methodical, each note a measurement of guilt. [259]  
Between phrases I whispered her name into the hollow station, letting the sound allude to the whistle we used to wait for, the one that never arrived on time. [278]  
The ivy rustled again, and I saw that the graffiti had continued lower, almost at the floor: “The platform is your sternum; forgive the beat that kept you alive.” [298]  
I knelt, pressing the taped bellows until they wheezed, and felt the station breathe with me, a lung of brick and vine. [312]  
In that shared respiration I understood the map had never been about geography; it was a chart of the chest cavity, each rail a rib, each sleeper a vertebra of remorse. [333]  
I opened the accordion fully, letting the patched leather gape like a wound, and I spoke into it—not to the walls, not to the river, but to the instrument that had carried every unsung apology. [355]  
“I left you on the bank because I was afraid the current would take us both,” I said, and the accordion answered with a low B-flat that rattled the signal bell into one clear, delayed chime. [378]  
The sound hung in the wet air, raw solace distilled, and I felt the medication’s last ghost dissolve, leaving only the taste of iron and mint. [395]  
I pulled the map from my pocket, the paper soft as skin, and tore it along the penciled line, letting the halves flutter down like shed scales. [413]  
On the bench I placed one strip of tape from the bellows, pressing it over the torn edge so the map became whole again, not as a guide but as a scar. [432]  
Then I played the song I had never finished, the one whose refrain alludes to the moment before forgiveness, when the heart is a station and the train is always almost here. [455]  
The ivy leaned closer, leaves trembling like listeners, and I felt the river I once chronicled moving beneath the rails, a hidden current answering in sympathetic vibration. [475]  
When the last note faded, I stood, lighter by exactly the weight of one withheld confession, and walked back through the ticket window without looking back, because the path to self-forgiveness is a track you lay by leaving. [505]  
Behind me the accordion’s patched bellows sighed shut, a final punctuation, and
