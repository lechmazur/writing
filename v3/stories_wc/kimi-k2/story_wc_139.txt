The prep room smelled of formaldehyde and lilies, a scent that made seventeen-year-old Lila think of her father’s cologne mixed with the rot he never admitted to. [34]  
She stood beside the porcelain table where Mr. Alvarez lay in borrowed dignity, his mouth sewn into a politician’s final compromise. [50]  
In her pocket she carried the vintage ink pot her father had once used to forge visas, its glass clouded like cataracts, its silver cap dented where he had tapped it for luck before every lie. [75]  
Tonight she would use it to sign the papers that would grant her father asylum in a country whose language neither of them spoke, a transaction she hoped might finally balance the moral ledger he had scribbled crookedly across her childhood. [108]  
The funeral director had stepped out, muttering about permits; Lila waited actively, palms open, counting heartbeats the way her father had taught her to count seconds during a con: one Mississippi, two Mississippi, until the mark’s certainty liquefies. [148]  
She needed the director’s seal on the death certificate—Alvarez’s death, not her father’s—so that immigration would believe the notorious forger had perished and stop hunting him. [183]  
The ink pot felt heavier than lead; inside it swirled not pigment but the residue of every promise her father broke, a black suspension that seemed to breathe. [213]  
She remembered the night he showed her how a single drop could turn a rigid border into a negotiable line, how ink, like guilt, spreads outward until the original shape is unrecognizable. [253]  
Mr. Alvarez had been their last client, a dissident who paid with his life instead of money; her father had forged him a passport, but the police intercepted the courier, and Alvarez’s corpse now served as the final prop in their escape. [295]  
Lila touched the dead man’s wrist, feeling the chill that travels faster than rumor, and whispered an apology for the mathematics she was about to perform: one death equals one life, plus the ink of forgiveness. [335]  
The door creaked; the director returned, keys jangling like tiny shackles. [350]  
He frowned at the girl beside the body, suspicion narrowing his eyes to paper cuts. [365]  
Lila lifted the ink pot, letting the overhead light fracture inside it, and said, “My father asked me to witness the embalming; he wants every detail exact for the state report.” [400]  
The director hesitated; the name on the file was flagged, but the girl’s voice carried the fatigue of someone who had already buried too much. [425]  
He turned to unlock the supply cabinet, and in that pivot Lila saw the breach: a momentary eclipse of vigilance, thin as a scalpel blade. [455]  
She uncapped the ink pot; the scent of iron and violet rose like a ghost, loosening the director’s rigid thinking until he wondered why a grieving daughter would lie about paperwork that seemed, after all, routine. [495]  
While he labeled vials, Lila slid the forged death certificate beneath the blotter, aligning it so the official stamp would fall precisely where her father’s counterfeit seal waited beneath layers of carbon. [535]  
She breathed in the deathly vitality of the room, the way life and decay performed their slow duet, and calculated the fair trade: Alvarez’s unlived years for her father’s uncertain future, minus the weight of her complicity. [575]  
The director pressed the stamp down; the ink bled through, marrying real and unreal in a single irrevocable mark. [595]  
Lila capped the pot, feeling the click like a vertebra settling back into place. [610]  
Outside, sirens wailed past, hunting a man already declared dead; inside, the dead man wore a smile that might have been gratitude or merely rigor. [640]  
She tucked the stamped certificate into the same pocket that held the ink pot, two halves of an equation she could not yet solve. [665]  
The director offered condolences; she accepted them like borrowed shoes, knowing she would walk far in them before they fit. [690]  
As she left the funeral home, dawn cracked the sky open, spilling pale ink across the city, and Lila understood that fairness was not a number but a process, a continuous revision of borders both national and personal. [740]  
She would mail the papers, then disappear, carrying the vintage ink pot as both inheritance and evidence, its darkness ready to liquefy whatever rigid certainties awaited her across the water. [780]
