The vivid mural artist, Liora, arrived at the amber pavilion in autumn with a tin box of old postcards and the question that had kept her awake since childhood: why do flowers bloom at night? [34]
She spread the postcards across the pavilion’s mosaic floor, each one a moonlit garden sent by her vanished mother over twenty years of silence. [50]
The pavilion’s copper roof had turned green, but the late October light still poured through the fretwork like warm honey, and the dawning hush that follows the last cicada settled over her like breath. [71]
She worked quietly, driven by the need to paint the answer before winter sealed the valley. [85]
Every dusk she climbed the hill to the abandoned cathedral whose west window was a single sheet of etched glass blackened by centuries of incense. [104]
Through the hidden layers of etched glass in the cathedral window she studied the moonflowers that clung to the stone tracery outside, their petals unfurling only when the sun abandoned them. [127]
She traced the acid-etched vines with a fingertip, feeling how the glass had been cut to let darkness in rather than keep it out. [147]
On the first night of November frost she brought a candle, and the flame threw her shadow across the nave so that she seemed to stand inside the bloom she could not yet paint. [169]
The postcards told her mother had wandered the same continent, always mailing cards from gardens that flowered under streetlamps or starlight. [189]
Across the melting of winter’s last snow Liora returned each evening, reckoning with the silence between the etched leaves and the living ones. [209]
She learned to grind lapis into a violet so deep it looked black until moonlight struck it, and she painted the cathedral’s interior wall with ghostly blossoms that appeared only when the candle burned low. [234]
Snow slid from the roof in slow avalanches, and the valley smelled of wet earth and thawing pine. [251]
One March dawn she found a single postcard she had never seen before tucked beneath the altar rail: on it, moonflowers opened around a pavilion identical to hers, and on the back her mother had written, “They bloom for the dark because the dark remembers them.” [285]
The words struck her with umbral tenderness, as if night itself had cradled her unknowing. [301]
She pressed the card against the etched glass until the images aligned, and for the first time the vines outside the window matched the vines inside her mural. [323]
That night she did not light the candle. [331]
Instead she waited until the moon climbed the broken tracery, and she watched the living moonflowers open in synchrony with the painted ones, pigment and petal breathing together. [355]
In the hush before dawn she understood: the flowers were not defying the sun but answering an older invitation, one that promised return rather than departure. [378]
She mixed a final glaze of amber resin and powdered gold, and with it she painted the cathedral’s threshold so that anyone who crossed would carry a faint reflection of night-blooming gardens on their skin. [408]
When the last snow melted, the valley filled with the scent of apple blossoms opening under stars, and Liora walked back to the pavilion. [428]
She arranged the postcards in a spiral on the floor, each card a petal, the whole forming a single night-blooming flower. [448]
Then she began the last mural, not on a wall but on the pavilion’s glass ceiling, using translucent oils that would glow only when moonlight passed through them. [472]
Across the melting of winter’s last snow she had learned to paint darkness as a tender presence rather than an absence, and the flowers she rendered seemed to breathe with the same quiet persistence that had carried her mother across continents. [508]
On the final night she climbed the cathedral tower and scattered the remaining pigment into the wind; it drifted down like indigo snow and settled on the moonflowers, making them shimmer as though remembering their own reflections. [540]
She descended to find the nave filled with villagers who had come to see the rumored miracle, but what they saw was simpler: walls that held the memory of every night garden their mothers had ever walked. [570]
Liora stood among them, quietly driven no longer by the need to understand but by the desire to witness. [588]
The dawning hush deepened, and in it she heard her mother’s voice not as words but as the soft unfurling of petals against stone. [608]
She walked out into the breaking day, and the moonflowers closed behind her like a book whose story had finally been read aloud. [628]
At the amber pavilion she sealed the postcards inside the tin, then set it beneath the new glass ceiling where moonlight would keep them safe. [648]
Years later travelers would pause beneath that ceiling
