After the eclipse’s shadow peeled from the cliffs, the wind-carved encampment resumed its perpetual hiss of sand on stone. [21] Only minutes had passed, yet everything inside the tents had aged an hour: bread hardened, a metal mug tarnished, and the albino tracker felt his pulse dragging, thick as cooling syrup. [39] He stood at the doorway, skin prickling where sun had never touched it, white lashes flicking over red eyes that recorded every distortion. [63] His name was spoken less than remembered, but he remembered the artificial hummingbird drone nestled inside his left lapel like a pocket watch with wings. [95] When no one spoke, he reached in, drew it out, and let the micro rotors unfurl into iridescent blur. [120] The bird’s glass eyes reflected the camp in stuttering frames: stove, cot, crate of chronographs ticking at three different rates, no two hands aligned. [152] Each discrepancy confirmed what he already knew but had to prove—time itself had thinned and folded. [183]  

Three nights prior he had spilled a pen of disappearing ink, watching letters unfurl across his journal before vanishing in under two breaths. [221] What remained were faint iridescent swirls, ephemeral patterns glimmering like oil on water—patterns that matched the drone’s wingbeats exactly whenever he flew it past the page. [262] He copied them into memory, then burned the evidence, but the residue clung to the edge of his vision like half-remembered faces. [296] Now, amid the still-burning embers of anger at whatever had twisted the hour hand, he sprinkled a fresh droplet onto the sandstone floor. [334] The ink soaked in, leaving a mirror of starved sky that spiraled inward. [359]  

Anger usually tasted metallic; today it tasted wind-scoured, serene, the way cliffs ignore storms that carve them. [388] The tracker exhaled until his ribs folded against spine, then whispered to the artificial bird: “Trace the distortion back to the moment.” [422] The drone zipped, its synthetic feathers skimming the ink’s reflection, each swoop painting new threads that pointed, not at a direction, but at a lapse. [456] He followed without walking. [465]  

The trail condensed into a single ribbon of darkness curling between instants; stepping inside felt like diving through glass. [497] Colors collapsed; red bled to rust, rust to silence; his heartbeat slipped a gear. [521] Somewhere ahead, past shredded seconds, he sensed the source—an intrusion, a deliberate wound in causality. [549] Ink around him began to vaporize, but the vapor rose in geometric folds; he folded with it, shedding mass and mass memory, becoming a pulse of consciously wild intention. [589]  

Time resisted. [594] It dragged against his intent like a heavy kite; he felt the string fray: one thread, then another, until only will kept him tethered. [631] In that fray he saw a memory not his own: the eclipse had a second shadow, knife-thin, slit into the moon’s edge—someone had used the event as a prism, splitting a heartbeat into nine. [676] Each fragment was now bleeding back into ordinary duration, stretching out crises for a hidden observer. [711]  

Enough. [714] The tracker snapped the invisible thread; it whipped around and knotted into the drone’s rotors. [737] The artificial bird exploded into a storm of mirrored feathers, scattering the stolen seconds away like dandelion seeds. [767] All clocks snapped back. [773] The ink dried to blank sandstone again; heat returned to cooled bread; the mug’s tarnish retreated; chronographs sang in unison. [809] Yet one feather lodged beneath the tracker’s thumbnail, warm, humming faintly—the final proof that the crime had happened, and that something had tried, yet failed, to erase him. [846] He smiled the serene anger peculiar to survivors who still intend to balance accounts, then turned his white stare toward the distant ridges, ready to disappear once more, if needed, through the next ephemeral pattern ink might dare to spill.
