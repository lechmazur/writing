The mirrors of the baroque asteroid had once reflected nothing but starlight, but after time became visible they began to show every second as a bruise-colored ribbon curling across the glass. [38]
In the ballroom of the hollowed-out palace, the defunct revolutionary Mara Voss moved from mirror to mirror, draping each with black velvet the way one might cover the eyes of the newly dead. [55]
She had once led the miners who carved this asteroid into cathedrals of living stone, but the revolution had collapsed when the Company offered the workers shares in their own chains. [70]
Now she was only a caretaker of dust and silence, poetically inclined toward elegy rather than manifesto. [80]
The archaeological dispute that had brought her here began when a shard of crystal vase was discovered wedged between two basalt ribs of the old throne room. [95]
The shard was no larger than a sparrow's wing, yet its facets held the entire history of the civilization that had flourished before the miners arrived. [108]
The Company claimed it as corporate heritage; the university claimed it as proof of pre-colonial settlement; Mara claimed it as the last breath of a world she had helped destroy. [123]
She devised a plan not to possess the shard but to reimagine the civilization it represented, to build from its fragments a new story untainted by profit or blood. [137]
Each night she studied the shard by candlelight, watching how its fractures caught the visible time and refracted it into possible futures. [150]
The miners' children had been taught that their ancestors were crude tool-users, but the shard's etchings showed gardens floating in zero gravity, music written in light, lovers exchanging memories like pressed flowers. [168]
Mara began to transcribe these visions into verse, her pen scratching against vellum as storms of chronal dust rattled the palace windows. [180]
During the worst storms she covered the mirrors more frantically, afraid that the visible time would show her the moment when she had betrayed her comrades for a promise of safety. [195]
One evening the lead archaeologist, Dr. Solenne, found her thus, black cloth in hand, standing before a mirror that showed Mara at twenty-three, shouting slogans she no longer believed. [210]
"You understand what you're doing is theft," Solenne said, her voice gentle as falling ash. [220]
"I'm not stealing," Mara replied, "I'm translating." [226]
She showed Solenne the verses: "In the gardens of the sky-people, sorrow grew like orchids, watered by the music of departing stars." [240]
Solenne traced the crystal shard's edge with a gloved finger, seeing in its reflection the same gardens, the same sorrow. [252]
The dispute had always been about ownership, but Mara argued that ownership was a language too small for what the shard contained. [265]
Together they devised a new method of archaeology: instead of extracting artifacts, they would extract stories, weaving them into the asteroid's existing myths like gold thread through black cloth. [280]
They held midnight readings in the throne room, where miners and scholars sat together while Mara recited her translations, her voice burnished with sorrow for what had been lost and what might still be saved. [295]
The Company sent enforcers, but found themselves listening to tales of a civilization that had measured wealth in moments of shared wonder rather than credits. [308]
The shard itself began to change, its fractures healing as new stories accumulated around it like nacre around grit. [318]
Visible time, once a torment, became a collaborator, showing not fixed pasts but fluid possibilities. [328]
Mara stood before the last uncovered mirror and saw herself not as revolutionary or traitor, but as a bridge between what had been and what could be. [340]
She pressed the now-whole crystal vase into Solenne's hands, saying, "This belongs to everyone who has ever dreamed of something better." [355]
The mirrors reflected not bruises but constellations, each star a story they had saved from oblivion. [365]
When the storms came now, they no longer covered the mirrors but stood before them, watching time rearrange itself into new constellations of hope. [378]
The baroque asteroid, once a tomb, became a seed ship carrying their reimagined civilization toward futures where sorrow was not erased but transformed into the burnished gold of shared memory. [395]
Mara's final poem, etched into the crystal itself, read: "We were never the owners of time, only its gardeners, tending the wild orchards of what might have been until they bore fruit for whoever comes after." [415]
The archaeological dispute dissolved like frost in morning light, replaced by a covenant: they would be stewards not of objects but of possibilities. [430]
The miners' children learned to read the crystal's shifting stories
