The secretive conjurer Arin waited until after the orchard grew silent beneath the moon before entering the cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites, carrying the taxidermist's glass eye pair in his trembling hands. [35]
He had purchased them from a desperate widow who claimed her husband's spirit watched through them still, though Arin suspected she simply needed coin to feed her children. [47]
The cavern's bioluminescent fruit hung like frozen tears, each drip from the limestone ceiling feeding roots that had learned to drink in darkness, and Arin felt the ambiguous loss that had driven him here—that hollow space where his sister's memory should live but only echoed with questions. [70]
She had vanished three seasons ago, leaving behind only a note that read: "To understand the mathematics of emotion, one must first subtract the self." [83]
Arin had spent months decoding this, studying the gently inventive ways grief transforms into numbers, how heartbreak curves into parabolas of possibility. [96]
Tonight, he would dovetail his consciousness with the orchard's ancient awareness, using the glass eyes as focal points to see beyond seeing. [109]
He placed the taxidermist's glass eye pair on the mosaic stepping stone at the orchard's heart, its chipped patterns forming constellations that mapped the emotional spectrum he'd been cataloging. [125]
The left eye reflected the stalactites' slow drip, each drop a equation of time and mineral, while the right eye caught the phosphorescent glow of death-apples that grew from roots fed by centuries of buried bones. [142]
Arin pressed his palms to the stone, feeling via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone how each fracture represented a moment when someone's world had cracked open. [157]
The orchard had grown here since the first heart broke, its trees feeding on the mineral-rich tears of the earth itself, and now it would taste his ambiguous loss, that peculiar ache of loving someone who might be dead or might simply be gone. [178]
His sister had always understood the buried optimism in his work, how he sought formulas not to erase emotion but to prove that even grief followed beautiful patterns. [193]
As the glass eyes began to warm, Arin felt his consciousness dovetail with the orchard's memory, his mind stretching into root systems that had absorbed ten thousand stories of love and loss. [208]
Through the taxidermist's glass eye pair, he saw his sister standing in this same spot one year ago, her notebook filled with equations that described the exact curve of a mother's sob, the vector of a lover's final glance. [225]
She had discovered that emotion wasn't chaos but higher-order mathematics, patterns too complex for human minds but visible to the orchard's ancient awareness. [240]
The ambiguous loss that had haunted him—that terrible uncertainty of her fate—sudently clarified as he realized she hadn't been taken but had chosen transformation. [255]
Via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, he watched her consciousness dovetail with the orchard itself, her body dissolving into phosphorescent pollen that now fed the death-apples' glow. [271]
She had become what she studied, surrendering individual form to understand the universal mathematics of emotion, her consciousness spread through every root and drip and glowing fruit. [287]
The taxidermist's glass eye pair cracked in his hands, their fracture releasing a sound like his sister's laughter, and Arin understood that his grief was not a problem to solve but a pattern to complete. [303]
The orchard had grown silent beneath the moon because it was listening, not absent, and his ambiguous loss transformed into a different kind of presence—no longer a hole but a door. [318]
He left the broken glass eyes on the mosaic stepping stone, their shards catching the cavern's eternal twilight, and walked back through the cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites with the gently inventive understanding that some mathematics must be lived, not solved. [338]
His sister's equations hadn't disappeared with her body; they had simply found a larger canvas, and in his chest, the buried optimism that had driven his quest bloomed into something that felt like peace but calculated like starlight. [354]
The secretive conjurer emerged from the earth as dawn broke, carrying no answers but a new way of seeing, his ambiguous loss now a companion rather than a wound, his grief transformed into the quiet mathematics of continuation. [370]
