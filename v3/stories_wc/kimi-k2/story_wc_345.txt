Altruistic ghost Mara drifted among the peach-weighted boughs of the orchard planet, her translucent fingers brushing the dew from blushing fruit as she searched for the butterfly garden watering bell she had left hidden beneath the lowermost branch of the grevnapping tree months earlier. [37] On this dawn when the blue sun of Perrollus streaked the sky with bruised coral, the bell’s brass pressed petals caught her lightless shimmer, guiding her like a beacon to the remaining fragment of her unfinished promise. [64] After strangers become family in this valley of hovering rock arches, she had vowed to create the nebula of respite, a sheltered space where orchard-tending souls could rest their gaunt bodies and name the ache that kept them waking. [91]

With the bell looped like a heartbeat to her spectral belt, the ghost inscribed her first message across the smooth stone of the town’s deserted sidewalk in pale chalk: “Gather seed pods from the west hedge before the arches eclipse the second moonrise.” [125] Those chalked words were strangely trustworthy in the way old mischief always is, echoing like borrowed memory up the stairs of Kyra’s cottage, halting the potter’s hands mid-wheel and the vintner’s sons mid-climb as they leaned into the scent of cooling cider. [160] By dusk, nine travelers—called together only by the silent flourish of a ghost they could not see—arrived carrying sacks of pods, their boots freckled with blossom dust and doubt. [185]

Reexamine, Mara had whispered into each noticing ear, though they did not know her voice. [197] She walked chalk foot-path circles twice more at dawn, scrawling kernels of guidance beneath every arch they placed their cups beneath: “Line the seeds along the roots when the river sings loudest, set your fears like stakes in the dark, water them with the bell only when the butterflies return.” [245] The pattern felt chancy, yet Orion the former pirate listened better to moonlight rubble than orders and nodded, directing the others to follow the brambled hope braided into the orchard’s hum. [275]

By nightfall the nebula began as gentle fog coiling through the fluttering milkweed, a breath of silence that bent the air into a hearth-shaped shelter where even dead dreams could warm their hands. [305] Here Mara balanced the butterfly garden watering bell atop an anvil stone and rang its porcelain tong once, then twice, and a third time until the wings of ghost-blue swallowtails rose like prayer flags above the arches. [337] Each pilgrim paused; breath clutched in their chest as if remembering every stranger who had chosen to become sister, every map drawn from necessity instead of greed. [368] They had come here to find safety, but instead found collective effort—no hero, just many hands tying stems, many names spoken into roots so the pain would not be staked to one heart alone. [398]

At the final dawn, Mara chalked the last message of all: “Care is a nebula endlessly unfolding.” [413] The words faded beneath the toes of Kyra’s twins as they danced, happy for the first time since the war had scattered their names across the starways. [437] She felt her form thin, not from distance but leaning in like music from harbor bells, the bell tucked once more beneath the peach tree roots where its scars matched every heel of every gardener who now tended patches not for victory but for healing. [468]

Reexamine, she whispered at the lip of the fog, and the nebula quivered, a translucent map slowly lighting. [484] Here, on the orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, after strangers chose bone and breath to indeed become family, the altruistic ghost’s orchestration hung ready—not finished, merely handed over. [510] Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn had become living parchment held by warm hands at high noon. [532] She would not watch from afar; her form would stay folded inside the breeze that tousled Kyra’s black hair when the next orphan touched the bell and felt the hint of her touch guiding them toward the orchard’s open heart. [560] The nebula of respite pulsed like a tide, till strangers again found family through the kindly strings led by a ghost who trusted the living more than the living sometimes trusted themselves. [590] And under each arch the fruit ripened with hush, promising the next child who ran headlong toward brambled hope that the voice beneath their palms was strangely, bravely trustworthy. [610]
