The druid stood at the edge of the cursed lake, her staff humming with the memory of a failed magic trick that had tried to still the orchard vortex. [31]
Wind spiraled through the gnarled apple trees, their trunks warped into living mirrors that refused to show her reflection. [45]
She had come here after the spell collapsed, after the lake swallowed the conjurer’s laughter and left only the echo of her own guarded heart. [63]
In her pocket rested the flesh-eating plant seed, a gift from the conjurer before he vanished beneath the black water. [82]
He had whispered that the seed would unbend the lie she wore like armor, but only if she dared to plant it where nothing else grew. [104]
The orchard vortex churned, branches writhing like serpents, and she stepped onto the ice that had formed after the magic trick failed. [127]
Each footfall sent cracks racing outward in expanding circles, as though the lake itself tried to map her path. [149]
She was a finder of lost things—lost keys, lost lambs, lost hours—but she had never found the courage to look for what mirrors refused to show. [176]
Tonight she would. [179]
She knelt at the center of the vortex, where the ice was thinnest and the trees leaned inward like conspirators. [203]
With frost-numbed fingers she pressed the seed into a hairline crack, feeling it pulse like a second heartbeat. [226]
The seed split open at once, sending crimson roots snaking through the ice, drinking the cold light of the warlike moon. [250]
A hush fell, serene yet bristling, as if the orchard itself drew a sword and held it steady. [270]
From the roots rose a single bloom, petals glossy as fresh blood, and at its core hung a frozen confession suspended in a droplet of amber. [296]
The druid stared, recognizing the voice sealed inside: her own, recorded the night she let the conjurer drown rather than admit she loved him. [324]
The bloom’s scent was iron and apples, and it pulled memory after memory from her, each one a shard of mirror she had buried. [350]
She saw herself turning away while the lake took him, saw the magic trick falter because her doubt poisoned the spell. [376]
The petals tightened, and the frozen confession began to melt, drop by drop, into the expanding circles of ice. [399]
Each drop carried a word—"coward," "liar," "thief of chances"—until the druid’s throat filled with the taste of her own unspoken truth. [427]
She pressed both palms to the bloom, letting its thorns pierce her skin, feeding it willingly for the first time in her guarded life. [454]
The plant drank, and the orchard vortex slowed, branches lowering like exhausted spears. [474]
Ice groaned, then unbent, folding back upon itself until open water gleamed black beneath the moon. [494]
The conjurer rose from the depths, not as a ghost but as a reflection made solid, his eyes holding the same warlike serenity that now steadied her pulse. [525]
He touched the bloom, and the last of the frozen confession slid free, a single tear of amber that he caught on his tongue. [552]
“I found what mirrors don’t show,” he said, voice soft as snowfall. [569]
“The part of you that fights to stay hidden, yet aches to be seen.” [586]
The druid stepped forward, letting the thorns fall away, her armor of silence finally unbent. [607]
She took his hand, and together they walked the expanding circles of ice that had become a bridge instead of a trap. [633]
Behind them, the flesh-eating plant withered, its purpose served, its hunger sated by the confession it had devoured. [659]
Ahead, the orchard stood quiet, no longer cursed but watchful, its mirrored trunks now reflecting two figures instead of none. [687]
The druid felt the warlike serenity settle in her bones, a peace won through battle with herself. [708]
She had come to find what was lost, and discovered it was the unguarded heart she had buried beneath years of fear. [734]
As dawn bled across the lake, the vortex dissolved into ordinary mist, and the orchard released its hold, satisfied that the circle was complete. [766]
She and the conjurer kept walking, leaving no footprints, only the memory of a seed that had eaten a lie and given back a life. [795]
