The performer stepped onto the sagging porch of the farmhouse, paint peeling like old scabs, while the colossal wind turbines above thrummed an endless mechanical heartbeat that swallowed every natural sound. [34]  
In the after of the Happiness Mandate, when laughter had been rationed by edict, the performer’s face had been medically cleared to be blank, neither smile nor frown permitted to disturb the neutral ideal the State now required. [54]  
Tonight the turbines threw moon-striped shadows across the brown fields, and the performer carried a dried flower bouquet brittle as fossil memory—heather, baby’s breath, and one crimson poppy preserved by smoke instead of water. [85]  
Inside, the farmhouse smelled of damp straw and diesel drifting through cracked windows; the performer sat at the warped kitchen table and began to whittle the stem of each dead flower with a pocketknife sharpened on silence itself. [120]  
Between the hollow scrape of blade and wood, he dramatically narrated the mundane task, voice low and theatrical as if unveiling a cosmic plot: “Behold, I sculpt a graveyard into wings.” [157]  
He spoke for absent listeners—his sister Mara gone three years, her laughter once bright enough to be illegal, her suicide note a single banned emoji. [188]  
Every slice reformed the hush that had settled after the Mandate: each petal falling like soft confetti rebuilt the quiet into something shaped, owned, almost sweet. [218]  
The performer knew his purpose was morally ambiguous—he trafficked in outlawed sorrow yet filed weekly Compliance Reports swearing neutrality—and the contradiction tasted metallic on his tongue like a coin hidden too long under a child’s pillow. [258]  
He held up the bouquet, now stripped to a fragile lattice, and watched shadows from the turbine blades sweep across it like gargantuan fingers turning pages. [294]  
He whispered his motive, a secret between performer and dead woman: “I cultivate lightness in grief by carving holes so wind can pass through instead of crushing what is left.” [331]  
The wind answered, rattling loose panes; one cracked sheet of glass fell and shattered without sound, the remade hush swallowing the crash before it could begin. [365]  
He scooped the shards into a dented kettle, narrating all the while: “First act, boiling water that will never be tea, water that will drink itself into steam and disappear.” [403]  
Steam rose ghost pale, curling around his blank face that registered nothing yet felt everything under the skin where expressions had been surgically muted. [442]  
A drone buzzed once overhead—the State’s nightly patrol to certify that emotional void remained stable—but it merely photographed a man cooking nothing and departed. [480]  
Alone again, the performer set the kettle atop the stove, flame low, and arranged the whittled flowers into a shallow saucer of paraffin; as wax melted he spoke Act Two: “We pour light into darkness, but darkness outruns every vessel.” [525]  
He dipped each skeleton bloom; wax made them translucent, luminous like memories trying to glow against the night turbines hissed louder, the remade hush now buzzing like an angry hive in the bones behind his ears. [568]  
For the finale he stood in the doorway and set the bouquet upright on the porch rail facing the turbines; wind rattled the waxy stems making soft glassy clicks. [605]  
The performer, blank of face, raised both empty hands and declaimed, voice carrying across the cropped fields: “I have taken sorrow, shaved it thin, glued light to the holes, and left it here as proof weight can be evacuated but never erased.” [655]  
Somewhere in the dark, a lone dog howled before being hushed by another, the sound absorbed so thoroughly it returned as only another layer in the remade hush. [690]  
He stepped back inside, leaving the bouquet to endure scrutiny from blade-shaped moonlight, feeling neither triumph nor failure—just the cultivated lightness he had promised, an ache hollowed until it almost floated. [734]
