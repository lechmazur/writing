The cryptic medium, Lira, pressed the gargoyle’s rainspout shard against her palm until its edge drew a bead of blood, letting the pain sharpen the fierce tenderness she needed to cross the mangrove labyrinth. [34]  
She had carried the unsent letters for seven years, folded so small they fit inside the hollow of her cheek, tasting their ink whenever she spoke of anything else. [52]  
Tonight the singing spirits rose with the tide, weaving lamentations between the roots, and their chorus promised to evoke the moment before deciding if only she would listen. [72]  
Lira stepped from the skiff onto the first hump of peat, boots sinking, moonlight already licking the cut on her hand, beginning the slow mend that only happened under open sky after dark. [93]  
Each breath she took tasted of brine and regret; each breath the spirits took sounded like a question she had never answered. [108]  
She walked deeper, following channels that braided and unbraided like memories, until the mangroves closed overhead and the moon became a silver coin tossed between leaves. [127]  
At a place where four waterways knotted, she halted, drew the shard from her pocket, and set it on a root polished smooth by tides. [144]  
The spirits circled, their song thinning to a single thread of humming that vibrated the shard until it rang like a struck bell. [160]  
Lira knelt, pressed her forehead to the bark, and whispered the first line of the oldest letter: “I left before I knew how to stay.” [178]  
Condensation bloomed on the nearest trunk, spelling her words back to her in reversed script, the labyrinth’s method of keeping every message ever breathed. [197]  
She read them aloud, voice shaking, and the letters in her mouth grew heavier, as though the ink were turning to lead. [211]  
The spirits answered by shaping the next sentence on the opposite trunk: “The apology waits unspoken in the space between heartbeat and heartbeat.” [230]  
Lira felt that space widen inside her chest, a hollow lit by moonlight, and understood it was the exact shape of the shard. [246]  
She lifted the fragment, touched its bleeding edge to the bark, and the tree drank a single drop; where it landed, a pale bud opened, luminous, healing in moonlight the way her skin was healing. [267]  
The singing spiraled upward, fierce now, tender still, demanding she finish what she had come to finish. [280]  
Lira unfolded the first letter with trembling fingers; the paper crackled like dry leaves, and the words she had never mailed lifted off the page as steam, drifting to the nearest window of water between trunks. [303]  
There they condensed into the face of the boy she had left, eyes wide, mouth open on a question he never voiced. [318]  
She spoke to the reflection: “I was afraid choosing you meant losing myself.” [329]  
The face dissolved, re-formed as her own younger self, clutching the same shard, hesitating on a threshold. [342]  
Lira saw the moment before deciding stretched like a bridge of moonlight across the water, and she stepped onto it. [356]  
The shard in her hand grew warm, pulling her forward, guiding her between trees that bent to form corridors of memory. [370]  
Each corridor ended at a pane of watery glass where another unsent letter waited to be read by condensation. [385]  
She read them all, voice steadying, fierce tenderness replacing shame. [395]  
The final letter was blank; she had never dared write the apology. [404]  
Lira lifted the shard, sliced her palm again, and let the blood bead on the empty page. [416]  
Where the blood touched, words rose, not ink but living tissue: “I am sorry I vanished before you could forgive me.” [432]  
The singing spirits took the sentence, harmonized it, sent it echoing through every root until the labyrinth itself became a throat singing absolution. [448]  
The shard in her hand crumbled into moonlit dust that settled on the cut and sealed it without scar. [461]  
Lira felt the unsent letters dissolve on her tongue, their bitterness replaced by salt-sweet air. [472]  
She stood at the labyrinth’s heart where the waterways widened into a mirror of black water reflecting both moon and her own healed face. [488]  
The spirits gathered behind her, no longer singing but breathing with her, one long tide of shared breath. [501]  
She spoke into the mirror: “I choose to stay present.” [510]  
The surface rippled, and the boy’s face appeared again, older now, smiling the way he had the day she left. [
