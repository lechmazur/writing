Upon the hush of budding hope, when dawn mist still clung to the ferns, wise orchard pruner Elowen climbed the verdant parapet beside the waterfall, her shears slung like a sleepy heron across her back. [35]
She carried a single heirloom seed in a pouch stitched from her grandmother’s wedding dress, a seed rumored to hold the first color ever seen by a child. [47]
Below, the cascade drummed a silver heartbeat, and above, the sky wove rose-gold threads between worlds, the way breath fogs a mirror that remembers every face it has reflected. [60]
Elowen was insatiably creative; she had once grafted moonlight into apple bark so the boughs glowed when owls called, but tonight her hands trembled with a different ambition. [75]
She intended to succor the color of wonder itself before it faded from people’s eyes, the way frost quietly erases a message written on a windowpane. [88]
Years of pruning had taught her that every living line wants to be released, not forced, so she planned to capture essence by luring it, not snaring it. [102]
She knelt on the parapet’s mossy spine, opened the pouch, and let the heirloom seed rest on her palm like a sleeping antidote to forgetting. [115]
The waterfall’s spray rose around her, forming small prisms that hovered like tentative angels, each one a doorway weaving between worlds. [129]
Elowen pressed the seed to her lips and whispered the name of the first color she had loved—verdigris, the bruised green of copper roofs after rain—because names are hooks that pull things toward memory. [145]
Instantly the seed unfurled a translucent root that did not seek soil but sound, drinking the hush that lay beneath the water’s roar, the radiant hush that is mostly possibility. [160]
She felt the root tug gently at her pulse, asking for stories, so she spoke of seasons when children chased monarchs through her orchard, believing the butterflies carried maps to the moon. [176]
With every tale, the root thickened into a vine that shimmered like oil on midnight water, weaving between worlds the way scent weaves through an open door, inviting both kitchen and garden to dinner. [192]
Elowen saw that the vine’s leaves were translucent pages; on each page fluttered a different color she feared the world was losing—cinnabar of dragonfly tails, saffron of thundercloud linings, ultramarine of silence under ice. [208]
Knowing she must succor these colors before they became only words, she lifted her shears, not to cut but to echo; she struck the blades together so their metallic kiss rang out like a bell made of frost. [224]
The sound folded into the vine, and every leaf drank it, the way a candle drinks the match that births it, capturing essence by turning music into pigment. [237]
The vine coiled upward, braiding itself into a small archway between worlds, a doorway no taller than a child’s dream, its threshold beaded with dew that refused to fall. [251]
Elowen understood the bargain: if she stepped through, the colors would survive, but she would become the unseen pigment, the wonder behind ordinary sight, a ghost of verdigris in every copper roof. [267]
She laughed once, softly, because an orchard pruner already knows how to disappear inside what she tends; she walked forward, shears still in hand, into the radiant hush that smelled of apples yet unborn. [283]
The archway sealed into a single seed again, dropping onto the parapet where moss instantly cuddled it, hiding the tiny scar where a woman had woven herself between worlds to preserve the color of wonder. [298]
Years later, children who play beneath the waterfall swear the spray sometimes paints their skin with shades they cannot name, colors that make them pause mid-laugh, listening for a voice that prunes fear into curiosity. [314]
And on the verdant parapet, a new sapling grows, its leaves flicking open at twilight to reveal stories written in light, an orchard of invisible fruit that feeds anyone who remembers to look. [328]
