The natural history illustrator, Lira, balanced on the copper gutter of the highest tower, sketchbook tucked beneath her arm, while the rooftop canal beside her trickled with moonlit water. [34]
She had followed the rumor that the giant who slept beneath the city dreamed in audible echoes, and that somewhere in the lattice of elevated waterways the sounds condensed into living shapes. [50]
Her pencil trembled not from height but from anticipation; she needed to draw the birthplace of echoes before the giant stirred, for only their true forms could finish the bestiary that had cost her every favor and coin. [70]
Around her neck hung the infinity symbol pendant inherited from her grandmother, a loop of tarnished silver that had once belonged, family lore claimed, to the architect who first convinced the giant to nap as foundation. [90]
Lira pressed the pendant to her lips, feeling the metal warm as if it recognized the approaching cadence of the dream. [104]
The canal forked ahead, splitting into two glass troughs that arched between towers like harp strings, and from the left trough came a sound that refused resolution—a chord that climbed, climbed, then cut itself short: an interrupted cadence hanging in the air like a question mark. [125]
She recognized the device from her studies; the giant's heart had skipped a beat, and the city above had recorded the hiccup in architecture. [140]
To reach the echo foundry she would have to sculpt time itself, bending the moment so the skipped beat could be replayed long enough for her to trace its source. [158]
She opened her sketchbook to a blank spread and drew the infinity symbol across both pages, the graphite line glowing faintly where the pendant touched paper. [175]
The drawing became a door; the paper thinned until she could see the canal beyond it, but the water ran backward, droplets ascending into spouts. [190]
Lira understood the method: by borrowing time from the giant's exhalation, she could step through the loop and uncage the suspended chord, releasing the echo into her lines. [208]
She whispered an apology to the sleeping titan, then dipped her finger into the canal and flicked a bead of borrowed future into the pendant. [224]
The silver loop expanded, encircling her like a halo, and the rooftop canal system weaving between towers rearranged itself into a spiral staircase of liquid light. [240]
Each step she took subtracted a second from the giant's nap, but the city did not notice; only the wind paused mid-gust, waiting for its moment to be returned. [257]
At the spiral's center she found a small iron cage bolted to the tower's crown, inside which a translucent chord thrashed like a trapped moth, its wings the shape of unfinished music. [275]
Lira set her sketchbook on the cage's roof and began to draw, her pencil guided by the chord's frantic vibrations. [288]
Lines became feathers, feathers became lungs, and soon the echo had a body: a glass bird with a throat full of unresolved questions. [302]
The interrupted cadence fluttered against the bars, desperate to escape back into the dream before the giant inhaled. [315]
Lira touched the cage door with the pendant; the infinity symbol aligned with the lock, and the metal dissolved into a ring of floating droplets. [330]
She spoke the word uncage, and the glass bird burst outward, scattering droplets that froze into tiny mirrors showing moments she had not yet lived. [345]
The mirrors spun around her, reflecting her future self finishing the bestiary, then her past self receiving the pendant, then a version of her standing in an empty city after the giant woke. [365]
The chord-bird perched on her shoulder and sang the missing note, completing the cadence at last. [376]
Time snapped back into place; the staircase collapsed into ordinary canal water, and the giant sighed in his sleep, none the poorer for the stolen second. [392]
Lira closed her sketchbook, now heavy with the weight of a captured birthplace. [403]
She descended by the maintenance ladder, past windows where citizens dreamed in sync with the titan below, their snores harmonizing with the distant water. [420]
On the street she opened the book again; the glass bird had folded itself into a single page, its wings forming the infinity symbol that now pulsed like a heartbeat. [437]
She knew that when the giant finally woke, the city would stretch and the towers would tilt, but the place where echoes are born would travel with her, portable in ink and paper. [457]
Lira walked on, pendant cool against her skin, listening for the next skipped beat in the architecture of dreams. [475]
