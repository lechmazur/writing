The gilded-leaf stationer, Liang, stood alone in the blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests that crowned Mount Qiyun, the town below already swallowed by a silence so complete it felt like glass. [34]  
In his pocket rested a battered notepad whose cardboard cover had softened to the texture of cloth, every page crowded with the invented histories he had been writing since the hush began. [52]  
He was earnestly studious by nature, the kind of man who measured silence the way others measured rain, and tonight he intended to refract the past into something the present could still hold. [73]  
To do this, he would chart the faint hum in the fluorescent lamp that flickered inside the abandoned tea pavilion at dawn, a sound so thin it seemed to come from inside his own skull. [96]  
The lamp had been left on when the last caretaker vanished, its tube glowing like a trapped moon, and Liang believed its vibration carried the residue of every conversation it had ever illuminated. [119]  
He set his brass fountain pen—nib trimmed with microscopic maple leaves—on the pavilion’s lacquered table and opened the notepad to a fresh page, the paper smelling faintly of cedar sap. [142]  
Each invented history began with a texture: the rasp of silk slippers on stone, the coolness of jade against a fevered wrist, the powdery sigh of pollen when a bonsai branch was released. [167]  
Tonight he needed the texture of the time just before the silence, when the town still argued over cricket songs and grandmothers traded rumors like hard candy. [189]  
He pressed the flat of his palm to the lamp’s plastic casing, feeling the hum travel through bone until it pooled behind his eyes as a color he could almost name. [211]  
With his other hand he drew a spiral in the notepad, annotating the pitch at three-second intervals, mapping how memory might curve if it were light instead of sound. [234]  
The bonsai outside responded to the lamp’s glow, their miniature leaves trembling as though the trees themselves were turning pages. [253]  
Liang remembered the stationer’s shop he had abandoned, its drawers of gold-flecked paper now host to moths, and the promise he had made to himself: to collect the textures of different times so that nothing would be truly lost. [280]  
He flipped backward through the notepad, past histories of imagined festivals, invented love letters, counterfeit weather reports, each entry labeled with a swatch of paper he had rubbed against the object while it still existed. [308]  
The hum shifted, thinning into a question, and Liang realized the lamp was beginning to forget its own past; the stories would soon be unrecoverable. [329]  
He steadied his breathing, earnestly studious even in panic, and began to speak aloud the texture of the last market day: the slap of carp tails on wet wood, the brassy ring of scales, the steam from peanut soup fogging cheap lenses. [358]  
The lamp brightened, its hum deepening, as if grateful to be remembered. [371]  
Liang refracted the sound through the prism of his own longing, translating frequency into phrase: “The children chased dragon shadows across the square, believing the paper beasts could outrun dusk.” [398]  
He wrote until the eastern sky blushed, the bonsai labyrinth exhaling dew that smelled of green tea and distant snow. [418]  
When the hum finally faded, the lamp dimmed to a coal-colored filament, and the silence returned, thicker than before but no longer empty. [439]  
Liang closed the notepad, its battered spine crackling like a small fire, and slipped it back into his pocket beside a sliver of gold leaf he had once saved for a wedding invitation that never arrived. [468]  
He stepped out of the pavilion, boots brushing moss that had learned to glow in the dark, and walked the narrow path between the bonsai, each tree a chapter he might one day read aloud to the quiet town. [495]  
At the edge of the labyrinth he paused, pressing the notepad to his ear as though it too might hum, and felt the collected textures stirring like moth wings. [518]  
He understood then that invented histories were not lies but lanterns, and that by charting the lamp’s dying song he had kept a small corner of the world incandescent. [545]  
The mountaintop wind carried the scent of pine resin and the faintest echo of laughter, a texture he would record tomorrow, when the next fluorescent lamp began its vigil. [571]  
Liang descended toward the silent town, the notepad warm against his ribs, its pages already luminous with the restraint of everything he had chosen not to forget. [600]
