The quartz-eye mender climbed the crumbling nave stairs, boots crunching on stained glass shards that once sang with hymns. [21]  
Above her, the abandoned cathedral’s vaulted ceiling had become a lush orchard, fig and apple branches threading through stone ribs like green embroidery. [37]  
Leaves whispered of the breach of contract that had emptied the town: the elders had promised the trees half their memories each autumn, then withheld the deciduous vows when winter proved kinder than expected. [63]  
Now the orchard punished them by bearing fruit that tasted of every secret ever kept, too sharp to swallow. [82]  
The mender’s endearingly feisty daughter had marched off at dawn, ribbonless, swearing she would rather forget than forgive. [104]  
Left behind on the altar lay the daughter’s hair ribbon, a scarlet scrap that smelled of young anger and apricot sap. [125]  
The mender tucked it into her forgotten bag, the one she had carried since apprenticeship, its seams swollen with oddments: copper nails, a cracked prism, three pages of lullabies, and a single quartz lens ground from her own left eye. [167]  
She had traded the eye for the skill to mend what time unknits, but today she meant to mend more than cracked stone. [193]  
She began to climb the scaffolding of branches, persist upward through dappled light, each rung a year between her childhood and her child’s. [220]  
Halfway to the clerestory, she found the first wound: a graft union split open, sap weeping like hot wax. [245]  
From the forgotten bag she drew the copper nails and the cracked prism, fitting them into the wound so the prism caught sunlight and soldered the bark with accidental wisdom, teaching the tree to refract rather than bleed. [295]  
A low hum answered, leaves rearranging into the shape of her mother’s face, stern yet smiling. [318]  
The mender’s heart buckled; she had not expected the orchard to remember grandmothers too. [339]  
Higher still, she reached the bell-less belfry where golden pears hung like mute bells. [359]  
One fruit fell, splitting to reveal not seeds but a memory: her daughter at seven, climbing this very tree, ribbon bright as war-banner, shouting that promises should never fall. [401]  
The mender pressed the ribbon against the memory until both shimmered, then tied it around a slender branch, binding past to present with scarlet thread. [432]  
Wind rattled the rafters; the orchard exhaled, releasing a fragrance of rain on old stone. [453]  
She understood then that generational wisdom is not a bridge but a graft: the old wood must split so the new can slip inside and grow. [493]  
At the highest point, where the spire once crowned saints, she found her daughter perched like an uncertain sparrow. [518]  
The girl’s eyes were wide, tasting the air of truce. [532]  
The mender opened the forgotten bag, letting its remaining contents spill: lullabies fluttered like moths, quartz lens flashed, and the copper nails rolled into a circle around them. [576]  
Without speaking, they sang the lullabies together, voices braiding like roots, each note a deciduous vow released to the wind. [612]  
The orchard listened, leaves turning gold in agreement. [626]  
When the last note faded, the daughter tied the ribbon around her own wrist, then around her mother’s, linking them wrist to wrist, pulse to pulse. [662]  
Below, townsfolk who had gathered at the doors felt the cathedral floor warm beneath their feet, as if memory itself were returning home. [700]  
The breach was not erased; it was transformed into the sweet rot that feeds next year’s bloom. [725]  
Mother and daughter descended slowly, branches bowing to let them pass, the quartz-eye mender seeing clearly now with only one eye, yet seeing more than ever before. [765]  
Outside, petals drifted down like soft amendments to every broken promise, and the town began, accidentally, to forgive itself. [800]
