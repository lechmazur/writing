The mercury-glass seer pressed her mirrored palms to the stone archway of the labyrinthine bookstore that occupied the entire mountain, feeling the tremor of buried talents stirring beneath layers of forgotten alphabets. [34]
After remembering becomes painful, she substitutes reality nightly by walking these endless shelves where languages go to die, searching for the lost language stone that once mapped the shape of home. [47]
Her reflection fractured across ten thousand spines as she whispered a childhood word—*tahara*—that used to mean the space between heartbeats, now just hollow wind. [70]
The bookstore breathed around her, corridors shifting like lungs, each exhalation releasing dust that tasted of iron and mothers' songs. [90]
She had seeded this quest years ago when she traded her name for the ability to read the texture of a feather, believing sensation could replace memory. [115]
Now feathers grew between the pages instead of bookmarks, and when she touched them she saw villages burning in languages no throat could pronounce. [139]
At the mountain's heart, where gravity forgets its purpose, stood a cage of glass containing the lost language stone—a black oval that hummed with every word her grandmother never taught her. [169]
The mercury-glass seer understood that to touch it would mean drinking centuries of voices, but her mirrored skin had begun to crack along the seams of borrowed reflections. [199]
She remembered her mother's hands shaping bread while singing in the old tongue, how the dough rose like a mountain becoming home, before soldiers made remembering a crime. [232]
Each night she substitutes reality by walking here, collecting fragments of sound that cut her palms like broken mirrors, building a lexicon of wounds. [261]
The labyrinthine bookstore knew her hunger; it rearranged itself so she would pass the same shelf of bird skeletons seventeen times, each skull containing a different dialect of flight. [295]
She pressed her ear to a raven's hollow and heard her brother laughing in a language that required the speaker to taste snow, before the melting came. [325]
The mercury-glass seer began to seed her own reflection into the feathers, trading pieces of her mirrored surface for syllables that tasted of cedar smoke and winter apples. [358]
With each transaction, she grew more transparent, more audible, until her footsteps rang like crystal against stone, announcing the approach of someone who had forgotten how to be solid. [392]
At the mountain's summit, where books become clouds, she found the lost language stone pulsing with the heartbeat of every exile who ever tried to pronounce home. [424]
She understood then that buried talents weren't stolen but planted, growing underground like reverse stars, waiting for the right mouth to harvest their light. [457]
The mercury-glass seer touched the stone with her final reflection, and it drank her mirrors like rain, leaving her skin raw and human and remembering. [487]
Words poured back into her—*tahara* meaning the moment before departure when home tastes sweetest, *shelai* for the sound of grandmothers stirring soup while wars begin elsewhere. [527]
She spoke them aloud, and the labyrinthine bookstore began to collapse inward, each book folding into a house, each page becoming a window where her family stood waiting. [564]
The mountain trembled as she seeded these recovered words into its stone heart, via the texture of a feather she plucked from her own regrown hair. [599]
As the bookstore dissolved into the mountain it had always been, the mercury-glass seer walked down its slopes speaking her grandmother's recipe for bread, each ingredient a syllable that rebuilt the village in her chest. [642]
She understood now that home wasn't a shape but a grammar, conjugated through generations of hands teaching dough to rise despite everything burning outside. [677]
The lost language stone crumbled into her palms, releasing every word that had been buried with the dead, and she ate them like seeds that would grow into her own children's mouths. [714]
When she reached the base of the mountain, she was no longer a seer but a speaker, her tongue heavy with thunder that had been waiting in the earth for someone brave enough to name it. [757]
She walked into the dawn speaking the first sentence that had never been lost: *I remember the shape of home because it remembers me.* [770]
