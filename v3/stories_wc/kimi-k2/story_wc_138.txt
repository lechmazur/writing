The immortal known only as Veyra drifted through the prismatic escondite, a hidden fold of space where light fractured into living color and silence pressed like velvet against the skin. [31]  
She had walked every corridor of infinity, tasted every star, and now she was bored beyond the reach of words. [45]  
During the hushed thunder of the approaching solar storm, the walls of the escondite shimmered with violet warnings, but Veyra felt only the dull ache of eternity. [66]  
She pressed her palm to a facet of the wall and felt the fragment of the cursed amulet pulse beneath the crystal, its jagged edge magnetized to the lattice of the pocket dimension itself. [93]  
Long ago, the amulet had been shattered across realities to prevent its whole from rewriting existence; each shard carried a sliver of will, and this one whispered mutiny against the geometry that kept the escondite stable. [127]  
Veyra, dimensionally aware since the first collapse of her native continuum, heard the shard’s invitation as clearly as a bell tolling inside her bones. [155]  
She had lingered at farewells across millennia—watched lovers turn to dust, galaxies gutter out—yet she had never learned what happens after goodbye. [190]  
The fragment promised an answer if she would only realign the magnetic fields that stitched the escondite together, letting the shard become whole for one reckless instant. [226]  
Intrigue stirred in her like a second heartbeat; she traced the invisible lines of force with her fingertips, mapping currents that curled like sleeping serpents. [259]  
Outside, the solar storm flared, ribbons of charged plasma licking the outer shell of the pocket, and every surge made the colors inside the escondite shiver toward chaos. [292]  
Veyra whispered a question to the fragment: “Will I finally see the edge of forever?” [312]  
The shard answered by tugging her toward the central prism, a cathedral of glass where the magnetic heart beat slow and steady. [340]  
She stepped onto the prism’s platform, boots ringing softly, and began to hum a frequency that resonated with the storm’s own song. [368]  
Lines of force bent toward her like iron filings to a lodestone, and the fragment rose from the wall, trailing sparks of indigo and rust. [396]  
As the fields twisted, the escondite groaned; corridors folded in on themselves, staircases inverted, and the hushed thunder grew louder, a drum inside a drum. [428]  
Veyra felt the spatial mutiny ignite: every plane of color declared independence from its neighbor, threatening to shred the pocket and scatter her across uncountable nowheres. [463]  
Still she sang, guiding the fragment into the hollow at the prism’s core where the final piece waited, magnetized by centuries of separation. [494]  
When the edges touched, the amulet fused with a sound like a sigh, and the storm outside roared approval. [517]  
Light collapsed into darkness, color into absence, and Veyra stood at the threshold of an impossible door. [538]  
Through it she saw not an ending but a hallway lined with every goodbye she had ever spoken, each one a lantern hung in the void. [569]  
She stepped forward, and the lanterns brightened, revealing figures she had lost—mentors, enemies, a child she once cradled through a dying universe. [602]  
They did not speak; they only smiled the way light smiles on water, and she understood that after goodbye there is not nothing but everything remembered at once. [639]  
The amulet, its purpose fulfilled, crumbled into dust that drifted upward like reversed snow. [659]  
The escondite steadied, corridors knitting themselves back into coherence under the calm after the storm. [680]  
Veyra lingered on the threshold until the last lantern dimmed, then turned back, no longer bored, her eternity now threaded with the quiet thunder of every farewell she would ever carry. [720]  
She walked the restored corridors, humming softly, the fragment’s dust glittering in her hair like starlight that had finally learned how to say hello again. [755]
