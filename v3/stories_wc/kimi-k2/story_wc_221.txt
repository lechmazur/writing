The observation deck had been silent since the shutdown, its chronometers frozen at 03:17 ship-time, the moment the dilation field collapsed. [28]
I stepped through the emergency seal, boots crunching on frost that had never melted, and felt the echoed silence settle over me like a shroud. [47]
They called me the blessed pariah—navigator who had once guided fleets through folds of spacetime, now exiled for refusing to abandon the deck when the order came. [74]
My crime had been compassion: I would not leave the temporal refugees still caught in stretched seconds, their faces flickering between expressions like slow lightning. [101]
Tonight marked the anniversary of the first dilation accident, and family custom demanded I sketch the night sky as my mother and her mothers had done on every voyage. [131]
I unrolled the star-chart vellum, brittle as memory, and set the gilded compass rose applique at its center, the same brass token that had adorned my grandmother’s sextant. [163]
The metal still held a faint warmth, as though it remembered hands that had last touched it before time splintered. [185]
I began to draw, but the stars above the deck were wrong; they drifted in languid spirals, victims of the lingering dilation that stretched each photon’s journey into centuries. [218]
My pencil faltered, confusion pooling like ink. [228]
I had come here to mourn, yet the sky refused to stay still long enough for grief. [245]
Instead, it invited me to explore the distortion, to treat anomaly as map rather than wound. [264]
I lifted the compass rose and aligned its needle with the slowest star, the one that had barely moved since the shutdown. [287]
The brass trembled, then spun, hunting for true north in a sky where cardinal points dissolved into curves. [309]
A soft chime echoed—no louder than a heartbeat—yet in the silence it sounded like cathedral bells. [327]
From the far end of the deck, where time was stretched thinnest, a figure glimmered: Captain Lys, my mentor, caught in the dilation’s amber. [352]
She raised a hand in greeting, the motion taking minutes to complete, and I understood it was not a ghost but a glimpse across the fracture. [378]
Her lips formed words I could not hear, yet the compass rose vibrated in sympathy, tugging me toward her. [398]
I followed, sketching as I walked, each line a tether between her dilated present and my linear now. [418]
The deck tilted beneath relativistic gradients; seconds for me became hours for her, and the sketches layered like sediment, recording the same sky at different rates. [448]
At the threshold of the worst distortion, I paused. [457]
If I crossed, I would join the refugees, trading exile for eternal hesitation. [472]
The compass needle steadied, pointing not to magnetic north but to the vector of my own acceleration—true north as a direction of will, not geography. [502]
I pressed the gilded rose against the chronometer glass; its reflection overlapped the frozen digits 03:17, and for an instant the numbers flickered, counting again. [532]
Captain Lys smiled, completion rippling through her like dawn. [544]
I realized the shutdown had never been a failure but a doorway left ajar, waiting for someone willing to turn confusion into exploration. [573]
Instead of stepping across, I began to sketch faster, translating her dilated gestures into a sequence of still frames. [596]
Each drawing shortened the gap between our timelines, compressing centuries into moments of shared understanding. [619]
When the last star was fixed on the vellum, the echoed silence lifted, replaced by the soft hum of reawakening engines. [642]
The dilation field contracted, folding itself into the compass rose, which now glowed with contained time. [663]
Captain Lys stepped free, her first unhurried breath in decades. [676]
Together we carried the star-chart back to the corridor where linear time resumed. [692]
The brass applique spun once more, then stilled, pointing toward whatever lay beyond the next horizon. [711]
I was no longer pariah nor blessed; I was simply navigator, ready to sail on currents of reclaimed time. [734]
Behind us, the observation deck darkened, its purpose fulfilled, its silence now a memory rather than a prison. [755]
We walked toward the bridge, the compass rose warm against my palm, true north beating like a second heart. [777]
