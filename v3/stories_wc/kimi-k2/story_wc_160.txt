Lila Ghent, ingenious floodgate machinist, knelt on basalt that exhaled warm stone breath beneath the overgrown terraces of the crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano. [38]  
She listened to the building the way sailors once listened to wind in the rigging, hearing in the tremble of column arches the faint percussion of distant gates she once kept water-tight, gates now cracked and leaking philosophy instead of riverwater. [62]  
The volcano slept but did not rest; its belly throbbed gently, as the building breathed, sighing sulfur dust that swirled like ghosts of forgotten audiences. [88]  
In her gloved hand hung an antique surveyor’s chain, bronze links measuring out both distance and memory with the same elegant clink. [113]  
She had come here not alone but carrying an argument folded into a single, still-sealed envelope left among her father’s papers after his deathbed confession five nights ago. [145]  
The envelope’s flap was now empty, torn open decades earlier by someone she had trusted too completely. [168]  
Yet a sticky residue glistened where wax once sang; it held remnants of his encrypted compassion—a dot pattern spelling her mother’s lullaby in Morse gum. [197]  
Using a loupe looted from engineering school, Lila worked by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope, lifting microscopic flecks with the tip of the surveyor’s chain’s brass slider, the way her father once lifted floodgate pins from their grooves. [237]  
Each translucent thread translated into coordinates she could triangulate against the volcanic bowl, because her father had believed conflicting values—love versus duty—needed harmonizing as urgently as conflicting floodwaters needed channels. [276]  
While she parsed the gum, the crater light shifted to dappled resolve, sunspots falling through fissures like gold coins tossed by an unseen hand. [303]  
She remembered why she had abandoned the gates: after the great storm of ’39, the city wanted higher steel walls, but her father wanted open meadows absorbing deluge; the fight cracked their house louder than thunder ever cracked sky. [352]  
This stage where actors once roared had become a confessional; each footstep echoed dialogue that rehearsed itself inside her chest. [378]  
Tremble—there it was again—not seismic but human, her own pulse matching the caldera’s sigh. [398]  
Suddenly the meaning clarified: the adhesive spelled the exact slope and acre where her mother planted white daffodils every spring, the ground Lila had been told to sell for steel profits. [441]  
The antique chain confirmed the distance from daffodil field to amphitheater’s centre stage: six chains, the same length as the floodgate she would be asked to raise. [477]  
Her father’s final slyly heartfelt wish became plain: replace one gate with the field itself; let river run through flowers instead of concrete. [510]  
She pictured gates rusting open, daffodils swaying in reflected moon-water, city children laughing as they followed floating petals downstream. [546]  
Yet that vision collided with civic engineers who demanded certainty and floodwalls, a conflict of values grinding like worn gears. [579]  
Therefore, Lila inscribed her own amendment across the volcanic dust floor using the surveyor’s chain as stylus, connecting mother’s flower slope to a new plan. [618]  
She would construct a rotating gate of living stems rooted in basalt niches, letting river pulse through petals when waters rose and close into flower lattice when waters fell. [662]  
As dusk slid violet fingers across the rim, she knelt, pressed the envelope’s torn flap against her heart, and felt the adhesive answer back, warm and sticky like a final embrace from her father’s hands. [708]  
Conflicting values met, not dissolved but woven; harmony rose not as consensus but as rhythm built on compromise that sang like the volcano’s breath. [748]  
Carrying the antique surveyor's chain like a conductor’s baton, Lila left the amphitheater, every step a soft tremble that promised gates of daffodil and water swinging open in equal measure. [784]
