The withdrawn knight, Sir Calen, stepped beneath the iron arch of the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night, moonlight replaced by the violet glow of grafted phosphor-apples. [34]  
He had once sworn a murmured allegiance to a cause he could no longer name, yet the vow still tugged at the seams of memory like a thread refusing to break. [55]  
Tonight, as reality shifts, the greenhouse doors had appeared where no doors had ever been, and he followed them because the shape of possibility smelled faintly of cedar and old greasepaint. [83]  
Inside, rows of dwarf pomegranate trees bled slow silver sap into glass gutters, feeding roots that spelled runic loops beneath the soil. [104]  
At the center stood a single wooden crate stamped with the faded crest of the abandoned marionette theater program that had once toured the border keeps before the plague of forgetting. [131]  
Calen knelt, gauntleted fingers trembling with shivering bliss, the cold thrill of nearing something both forbidden and necessary. [152]  
The lid opened with a sigh, releasing the scent of dusted lavender and rusted wire. [168]  
Inside lay a puppet knight, jointed in walnut, its enameled eyes reflecting the violet glow with factually mystical depth, as though it had already seen every future branch. [195]  
A parchment scroll curled around its torso like a lover; inked upon it were forgotten patterns of movement, the choreography of an oath older than language. [220]  
Calen recognized the first knot: the same gesture he had used to unsnap his own gorget the night he deserted the order. [242]  
He whispered the murmured allegiance again, this time shaping the words around the puppet’s carved ears, and the greenhouse air thickened, petals of light peeling from the fruit to orbit the scene. [272]  
The puppet stirred without strings, wooden limbs articulating through forgotten patterns that mapped the geometry of regret. [292]  
Each gesture drew silver sap up from the roots, braiding it into translucent cords that hovered like harp strings tuned to heartbeat. [312]  
Calen understood the theater program had never been entertainment; it had been rehearsal for moments when reality grows thin and must be re-stitched by those willing to perform the old motions. [343]  
He placed his palms against the puppet’s chest plate, feeling the grain of walnut become warm skin, the boundary between knight and effigy dissolving. [365]  
Memory flooded back: the child queen he had sworn to protect, the night she vanished into rumor, the guilt that drove him into exile. [387]  
The greenhouse pulsed, endless night contracting to a single violet seed suspended between them. [404]  
To capture the shape of possibility, he must finish the performance, become both marionette and master. [424]  
Calen unsnapped the final clasp at the puppet’s throat; the wooden helm fell away, revealing a mirror of his own younger face, eyes wide with unspent courage. [450]  
The silver cords whipped inward, lacing through his armor, grafting possibility to sinew and bone. [468]  
He felt the orchard tilt, gravity loosening like a slackened string, and knew the greenhouse was a cocoon preparing to hatch a new axis of time. [490]  
The withdrawn knight straightened, no longer alone inside his armor; the puppet’s heart beat against his ribs, a second cadence syncing with his own. [513]  
Together they stepped toward the glass wall, where the violet seed hovered, waiting to be planted in the furrow of the world. [535]  
He pressed his gauntlet to the pane; the glass melted into dew, releasing the scent of thunderclouds and ripe apples. [554]  
Beyond lay not the night he remembered but a corridor of branching dawns, each path shaped by the choreography he now carried in muscle memory. [578]  
Calen crossed the threshold, the greenhouse folding behind him like a paper lantern extinguished. [594]  
In the hush that followed, only the murmured allegiance remained, echoing across the newborn sky, a vow no longer withdrawn but dancing, finally, in the open air. [624]
