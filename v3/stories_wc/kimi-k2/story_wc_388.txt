Lina checked the dosimeter sewn into her collar before stepping into the orchard, a crooked grid of apple trees that pulsed green even while the sky spat grey radioactive dust. [28]  
The trees around her had once belonged to the Collective's private nursery and now, after the liquidation, their hybrid trunks stood like cynical monuments inside a wasteland that refused to stay dead. [44]  
She walked the lines until one tree drew her: its single unpicked fruit gleamed like flawed glass, impossible red. [58]  
A week earlier, a courier had stumbled out of the storm bleeding and fevered, swearing this very Diamond Apple had turned black in his pocket and whispered predictions no man should hear. [83]  
Lina—sharply observant conspiracy debunker—scoffed at the tale, but the courier had died with her name on his tongue and the name of the orchard, so here she was, come to excavate truth from the nation's comfortable lies. [113]  
She pocketed the Apple. [116]  
Near the roots she found a saddle leather satchel slit open, papers scattered like spoor. [130]  
The wind hissed, smelling of iodine and cinnamon. [137]  
The pages were ribbons of shredded letters, sliced by some official hand fearful of permanent ink. [153]  
She gathered every feathery strip, knowing from long habit that words reassembled in darkness sometimes rearranged history. [172]  
That night she sat beneath an outcrop of translucent quartz—her teacher had called such places stillpoints, hidden nodes where time widened a moment to breathe. [198]  
From the heap, she began to intuit order, not by logic alone but by the tension between torn edges: a curve that wants another curve, a serif reaching for the serif it lost. [231]  
Slowly, confession emerged: the Diamond Apple was no gem but living quartz containing irradiated seeds capable of germinating human memory. [261]  
The trees had not thrived by accident; they drank genetic spilled from mass graves the nation's bulletins insisted never existed. [283]  
She read how the Council first seeded the orchard to hide bodies under gentle roots and named the place Sanctuary in the books while calling it Evacuation Funnel in the files. [320]  
And then her own name appeared, written years ago in her father's hand, telling his handler that a stubborn daughter would come looking and that she must be gifted the Apple so the experiment could complete. [358]  
Lina sat very still, feeling the stillpoint flicker as the orchard registered her heartbeat and adjusted the wind accordingly. [385]  
In the moonlit radioactivity the Apple dulled and, in one crystalline facet, she watched blurred faces—refugees the liquidation had swallowed—blink awake. [411]  
They were not ghosts but data encoded in mineral. [421]  
She weighed the stone. [423]  
Truth would mean broadcasting proof that would tear the fragile peace stitched from lies. [439]  
Silence would let the trees grow memories unwitnessed and shield the living from more reprisal. [459]  
She considered burning the letters to save further blood, but the courier had bled so the words could reach her. [484]  
She looked at the shredded strips and began folding them into a tiny paper compass, every flap a sentence, every tuck a question. [511]  
She pressed the compass into the Apple’s flawed heart. [523]  
Standing at the edge of the wasteland orchard at dawn, she felt the stillpoint contract, ready to move on. [545]  
She chose to plant the Apple back beneath the father-tree, setting the paper compass on its crown like a fuse. [568]  
The quartz closed softly. [570]  
Clouds feathered with fallout drifted east. [576]  
Some truths, she knew, would rather become trees and bear bitter fruit than become headlines and bear more graves. [599]  
As dust obscured the orchard behind her, Lina walked back toward the inhabited regions with empty pockets yet carrying a sharper gaze, ready to listen for the next whisper of history someone's scissors missed. [639]  
Behind her, in a silence no Geiger could measure, the wasteland orchard quietly compassed itself, preparing its eventual harvest of memory for the season after storms. [678]
