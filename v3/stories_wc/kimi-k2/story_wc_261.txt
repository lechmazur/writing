The anesthesia wore off at 4:47 a.m., and Mara woke gasping in the quiet tower, her tongue tasting of iodine and regret. [25]
She was a closure seeker who opened wounds, and the newest wound was a neat red seam across her left palm where the surgeon had removed the shard of frosted hourglass that had lived in her flesh for twenty-three years. [50]
The hourglass—now sealed in a glass dish on the bedside table—had stopped bleeding sand the moment it was extracted, its last grain suspended like a displaced miracle refusing to fall. [75]
Mara sat up, dizzy, and the potted fern beside the window unfurled a single frond toward her in sympathy; she had been accidentally telepathic with plants since the day the hourglass first cut her, and their whispers now rustled through her veins like green static. [105]
She pressed her bandaged hand to the cool stone wall and felt the tower’s ivy mourn with her, each leaf repeating the same word: tunnel. [125]
The word echoed in her skull until she rose, barefoot, and followed the corridor spiraling downward, past sleeping doors and moonlit tapestries, until she reached the kitchen where the night nurse had left a single mug of coffee cooling on the table. [155]
Steam had condensed into rings inside the ceramic, and Mara, who had learned to read stories in scars, now bent to read them in coffee rings instead. [180]
The outermost ring was jagged, like the cliff where her brother had slipped; the next was a perfect circle, the face of the lake that had swallowed him; the third was a spiral, the same spiral carved into the frosted hourglass that had appeared in her pocket the day he died. [215]
She touched the spiral and the ivy on the windowsill shivered, showing her a memory: the hourglass falling from her brother’s hand as he reached for her, its glass shattering against stone, one sliver lodging in her palm, time pausing inside her like held breath. [250]
The plants murmured that the hourglass had never been meant for her; it was a displaced miracle, a gift from the sky that should have granted her brother one more day, but it had chosen the wrong sibling, burrowing into her skin and trapping his last moment inside her. [285]
Mara’s knees buckled; the meteor hush of dawn pressed against the windows, and she understood that the tower itself was a tunnel, a passage between the living and the lost. [310]
She carried the dish containing the hourglass to the eastern balcony where the first pale light touched the horizon like a scalpel. [335]
The ivy followed, coiling around her ankles, urging her to finish what had begun twenty-three years ago. [355]
She unwrapped her bandage; the scar was fresh, pink, shaped like an hourglass. [370]
With a steady hand she lifted the extracted shard—still frosted, still warm—and pressed its sharp edge against the new scar. [395]
Blood welled, bright as sunrise, and the suspended grain of sand inside the shard trembled, then slid free, falling not downward but upward, dissolving into the sky. [425]
The plants exhaled in unison, releasing the memory they had guarded: her brother laughing as he ran along the cliff, turning to wave, the hourglass tumbling from his pocket, time unraveling in a glittering arc. [465]
Mara felt the tunnel close, the quiet tower settling around her like a sigh. [485]
The ivy loosened, the fern lowered its frond, and the coffee rings in the mug below began to fade, their stories told. [510]
She bandaged her hand again, this time with the clean linen of acceptance, and walked back to her room where the empty dish waited. [540]
She placed the dish on the windowsill; morning light filled it like water, and for the first time in twenty-three years, no plant whispered, no leaf trembled, no green voice echoed in her blood. [575]
The hourglass was gone, the miracle returned to the sky, and Mara—no longer accidentally telepathic—stood alone in the meteor hush, listening to the silence of her own heart learning to read the stories in scars that no longer bled. [620]
Outside, the sun cleared the horizon, and the quiet tower at dawn held only one sound: the soft, steady ticking of a new day beginning. [650]
