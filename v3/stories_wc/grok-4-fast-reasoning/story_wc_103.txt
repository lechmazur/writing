In the living bridge garden, where vines twisted into arching spans like the veins of an ancient earthbound leviathan, Elias wandered with the tremor of a half-remembered dream. [15]

As a hedge maze designer, he had come here seeking not just patterns of green labyrinths, but something deeper—a way to trace the texture of time itself. [41]

The garden's bridges pulsed with life, their living wood groaning under the weight of blooming creepers, forming a network that seemed to defy the flatness of ordinary space. [78]

Elias's hands, callused from years of clipping yew and boxwood, itched to impose order, yet his mind quivered in reverie, haunted by the elusive weave of moments past and fleeting. [114]

He had always designed mazes as metaphors for the mind's wanderings, but this place called for more: hyperbolic geometry, with its saddle-shaped curves and infinite tilings, to bend paths into impossible loops. [157]

By folding space in hyperbolic folds, he hoped to peel back time's layers, feeling its grainy grit or silken slide. [184]

The motivation burned in him since childhood, when his mother's fading photographs—images of her youth yellowing at the edges—had first whispered of time's cruel erosion. [221]

Those photos, tucked in a drawer, grew fainter each year, as if the past itself was dissolving into forgetfulness. [245]

Now, in this quaking reverie of rustling leaves and distant bird calls that echoed like sighs, Elias knelt by a bridge's root to sketch his design. [279]

The air hummed with a strange vibration, and his pencil trembled, tracing hyperbolic hexagons that warped the paper unnaturally. [306]

Suddenly, glinting amid the moss, he spotted it: a halo fragment, a curved shard of ethereal light, no larger than a thumbnail, pulsing with an inner glow. [339]

It wasn't glass or metal, but something warmer, like solidified memory, and as he lifted it, a shiver ran through him, quaking his reverie into sharper focus. [373]

The fragment warmed in his palm, and visions bloomed—not forward, but backward, retrocognitively trapping him in the garden's hidden history. [402]

He saw the garden as it was centuries ago: builders weaving the first living bridges from sacred saplings, their hands blurring in the hyperbolic arcs they intuitively followed. [439]

Photographs materialized in his mind's eye, not physical but spectral, fading even as they formed—images of laughter under these same spans, lovers parting, children chasing fireflies. [478]

Each vision quaked with the texture of time: rough like bark in moments of joy, slick and dissolving in sorrow, the core concept of fading photographs etching itself into his soul. [517]

Elias staggered, retrocognitively trapped, his body rooted while his awareness looped through the past, unable to break free. [541]

The halo fragment grew hotter, its light fracturing into hyperbolic patterns that mirrored his maze sketches, pulling him deeper into the weave. [572]

He realized the garden itself was a living maze, its bridges designed through hyperbolic geometry by forgotten artisans, to capture time's essence. [604]

To escape, to truly feel time's texture, he must act—disintegrate the fragment, let its power unravel the trap. [632]

In his quaking reverie, Elias pressed the shard against a vine-woven arch, whispering incantations of release drawn from the visions. [662]

Through hyperbolic geometry's lens, he envisioned the disintegration: not a straight shatter, but a folding inward, edges curving infinitely until the fragment collapsed into nothingness. [700]

The halo pulsed once, twice, then began to warp, its form stretching in saddle curves, light bending into endless regressions. [727]

Fading photographs swirled around him, their images dissolving into motes that revealed time's raw texture—grains of sandpaper regret, threads of velvet anticipation. [759]

With a final quake, the fragment disintegrated, vanishing in a hyperbolic spiral, freeing Elias from the retrocognitive snare. [783]

He collapsed onto the bridge, the garden's living pulse syncing with his breath, forever changed by the texture he had touched. [806]
