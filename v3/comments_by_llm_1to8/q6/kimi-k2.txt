    Strong perceptual signature filters everything through Mara's scientific lens—"motes that drifted like slow comets," "frequency map." The dialogue to absent butterflies feels authentic to her character. Slight register elevation in places ("kindled humility," "patient arithmetic") occasionally strains against the observational voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm: "luminous glass artist stood at the lip of the quiet canyon." The perceptual signature focuses on light, fracture, and pattern—appropriate for a glass artist. Prose modulates effectively between contemplation and discovery, though occasional elevated diction ("drifting resonance") slightly strains the register.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature with Rowan experiencing emotion as color and temperature. Strong rhythmic control with lyrical compression ("capsized from a ferry that no longer crested any wave"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the POV's established voice ("rectifying his riotous inner ocean").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent mystical-realist register with strong perceptual signature ("books floated like jellyfish"). Prose rhythm modulates well with pressure, particularly during the library collapse. Some filter verb accumulation ("He recognized," "He hesitated") dulls immediacy in middle beats, and occasional register elevation ("occupying impossible spaces") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice maintains consistent elegiac register with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature strong in selective details (bell "no larger than a walnut," moon "low enough to snag"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext and advances character relationships naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("twilight viaduct in bloom," "barefoot pilgrim of sparks"). POV remains stable with Mei-Ling throughout. Some register elevation in mystical moments feels slightly forced ("calcified grief"), and occasional filter phrases ("She felt," "She saw") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register—"silver halides retreating into blank paper as though ashamed." POV remains stable through Elara's consciousness even as she dissolves. Perceptual signature strong: her designer's eye sees corridors, geometry, and patterns throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with selective perception like "wind chimes made of regret" and "tectonic teeth." POV remains stable and controlled. Some elevated diction ("staggering grace," "latent electricity") slightly strains against the grounded action but serves the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through cross-wired synesthesia creates unique voice where "orange hummed like distant trumpet." Lyric compression and patterned imagery serve the accumulative mode perfectly. No dialogue maintains appropriate isolation while prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "pockets heavy with stolen light," "destiny's door creaked open a finger's width." The perceptual signature of cataloguing faces and translating light into portraits shows character-specific noticing. Some elevated diction ("luminous disbelief") occasionally strains but rhythm supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mara's theatrical narration ("Observe," "And lo") creates a distinct voice that reveals character through performance. The perceptual signature shows in how she sees maps as molds and thawing as glass-gathering. Free indirect style maintains consistency. However, register occasionally elevates beyond her established voice ("cartographer who traced these havens"), and some constructions feel writerly rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent film noir tone with effective metaphors ("stunt double to a vanished star"). Dialogue between twins feels slightly generic ("I knew you'd decrypt the cast"), missing opportunity for more distinctive speech patterns. The POV's perceptual signature focuses appropriately on motion and physical details given their profession.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—the oracle experiences silence as physical textures ("scrape of absence," "velvet dark") and the prose rhythm modulates from measured observation to urgency as "her mildly obsessed fingers moved faster."

The rhythm accelerates effectively during the escape sequence, though some filter phrases ("she thought") could be cut.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains lyric control through rhythmic variation and selective perception focused on water, light, and musical absence. Phrases like "wordless conversation began between her pulse and the faint creak" show distinct texture. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("trembling kaleidoscope"), but compression serves the accumulative design and the perceptual signature remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signatures emerge—the oracle's marginal awareness and botanical precision, Elias's meteorological framing and graphite-stained practicality. Rhythmic control mostly holds under emotional pressure, particularly in shorter sentences during the tower scene.

    The voice maintains lyrical control through rhythmic variation and selective perception: "soft drip of mineral water and the poet's own pulse to measure the night." The prose modulates from contemplative distance to intimate tactility when fingers trace rope fibers. The perceptual signature remains consistent—a poet's attention to texture, pattern, and metaphysical possibility—though some passages edge toward over-elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"hearing every heartbeat of the world" shapes how she experiences the greenhouse's transformation from "drowned bells" to nascent orchestra.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent maritime metaphors ("visiting schooner," "quay master") that fit the broker protagonist. Dialogue feels natural when present. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("star-drunk breeze," "stowaway kindnesses") that doesn't fully align with Marisol's practical profession, and emotional ventriloquism occurs when narrating others' experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with selective perception (fingers smelling of peat, obsidian flecked with mica stars).

She set...") and occasional register drift into elevated diction ("freighted with betrayal") that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "meteor hush," "green static," "displaced miracle refusing to fall." POV remains tightly focused through Mara's perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively from clinical opening to mystical revelation. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds the established register ("consensus of acceptance").

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: Mara processes the world through crystal-gazing vocabulary ("psychometry reading," "incubating memories"). The lyric compression serves the accumulative structure, with controlled rhythm shifts marking emotional peaks ("Frame by frame, the goodbye letter advanced"). No head-hopping; POV remains firmly anchored to Mara's specialized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("moonstruck dreamer," "forgotten wishes"). The prose modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, particularly in the transformation sequence. No head-hopping, consistent POV distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains dreamlike coherence through controlled surrealism: "divergent archive that folds every possible past," "hands humming through wave functions." The lyric compression ("occasionally everywhere") and scientific-poetic fusion ("silicate saplings," "wave function of guardianship") create distinct texture. Dialogue between guard and archive carries mythic weight without losing naturalism: "I kept your dreams" / "I have no dreams left to keep."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout with synesthetic observations like "the hum of insight vibrating in her molars" and philosophical filtering of sensory data. Voice maintains lyric consistency through patterned compression and taught elisions that pay off in the dissolution sequence where language itself unravels.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("gently persistent rhythm of waves that refuse to forget the moon"). POV maintains mystical distance appropriately, with selective perception ("eyes wide as harbor mouths"). Dialogue carries ritualistic weight without feeling stilted, especially Mara's "you must first traverse yourself."

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through selective attention (counting steps by discoloration, feeling bolt threads like "tiny teeth"). Voice maintains lyric compression throughout with controlled rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("seraphically mundane") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon during non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive elevated register suits the mythic scope with controlled syntax like "scrolls whispered secrets to the dark." Some register drift into overly ornate phrasing ("silver spears," "flesh from bone") that occasionally obscures immediacy. POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Thimble.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose maintains a distinct dreamlike register with controlled imagery ("stilts like a heron asleep," "walls breathed in slow centuries"). POV remains stable through Mara's perception, with her technical background coloring observations ("titanium wall," "sensors," "gauges"). The mystical elements are filtered through her scientific lens, creating productive tension, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("periodically eternal," "withheld information").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"daylight bled violet," "freighters rise like luminous whales." The perceptual signature of someone who sees cosmic patterns in mechanical ruins remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through plant-speech and insurgent history coloring observations. Dialogue carries subtext effectively (mason's "If destiny can evolve, so can we").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception shaped by trauma ("a skill she practiced on strangers"). The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation of somatic responses and lyrical moments like "the slow heartbeat of sap," though occasional phrases feel workshopped ("species name").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinct perceptual signature ("dust drifted like pale plankton," "vellum wings"). The rhetorical questions function as character-specific thought pattern, and psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to deep interiority during the descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV maintains consistency through Alba's tracker perspective with distinctive perceptual details like "feeling the residue of something more than pigment." However, sudden knowledge leaps occur when she "understood then" complex temporal mechanics without sufficient dramatization. The chronographer's dialogue feels functional rather than naturalistic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled diction matching the cold, precise world. Good psychic distance modulation. However, some register drift into overly literary phrasing ("chimeric fragments," "featureless between triumph and terror") that occasionally breaks the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains lyrical control with purposeful compression ("crimson as cooling embers," "tranquil blaze"). POV stays firmly with Lila's sensory hypersensitivity. Some elevated diction ("inculcating plants with values") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the piece's heightened register.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "voicing silence the way a wolf mouths snow," "iron conducting divinity the way wire conducts fire." The prose modulates with pressure, accelerating during the goddess's arrival ("Between one heartbeat and the next") while maintaining coherent voice even as Lira transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature with phrases like "moonlight rings the valley peaks like brass fittings on an old ship's wheel" and consistent elevated register fitting an heiress who thinks in mathematical proofs. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent to quietly triumphant. Minor moments of overwriting ("airy suspension of a skeptical pause") don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyric compression—"every footstep erased itself," "walls exhaled dust instead of hours." The perceptual signature remains consistent through stress, with syntax reflecting the protagonist's artistic-scientific mindset. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates effectively from dreamy observation to visceral action during the tattooing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency with phrases like "lilac mist clung to every breath like a secret," though some passages drift into elevated register ("socially perceptive antennae quivering"). The perceptual signature of an artist who thinks in patterns and color is distinct but occasionally over-written.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice maintains lyric compression with purposeful elision ("the hundred fractured" cuts off meaningfully). POV filters everything through architectural/artistic perception fitting the reconstruction work. Dialogue sparse but weighted with subtext. Excellent control of psychic distance during the retrocognitive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive lyric voice with synesthetic perception ("chord of cinnamon and distant thunder") and temporal paradox embedded in syntax. The prose modulates effectively—sparse during description, dense during transformation. Minor inconsistency in register when explaining the coin's function more prosaically mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through precise technical language ("fractally precise spiral," "muscovite geode sliver") balanced with embodied perception ("willowglass soft").

Minor register elevation in places ("stubborn tenderness I kept calling skepticism") but largely consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Lira's professional lens—everything filtered through heat-mapping colors and emotional temperatures. Rhythm accelerates during the dream-merge sequence with shorter, more urgent syntax. Purposeful compression in lyric passages ("cities dissolving into forests, oceans breathing fog") teaches pattern early and pays off. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("transitional object and transitional being both") that briefly exceeds POV's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through selective noticing—the turner reads buttons like text, hearing echoes "shiver like a struck bell." Voice maintains lyrical consistency without overwriting. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("quietly inspired by the notion") that doesn't fully match the mystical-practical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with selective perception focused on coded details and tactile sensations fitting a trained spy's observational habits. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from the contemplative opening to the tense code-following sequence. However, some passages drift toward elevated register ("silver hush that clung to the cliff," "torn paper" gulls) that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon during stress, and Mara's minimal dialogue prevents full voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive syntax ("I am that coachman") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature—how the coachman notices fog "percolating through ribs" and memories "bleeding through"—creates a unique consciousness, and dialogue carries appropriate weight and mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"thrum answered, guiding him deeper" and "feeling wax soften on his skin." The prose modulates effectively between meditative observation and sensory immersion. Minor register elevation in places ("phototropic to kindness itself") that slightly exceeds the zen potter's expected lexicon but serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with musical cadence ("luminous harbor by moonlight") and selective perception focused on tactile details. The "rhythm of oars in water" becomes syntactic pattern in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice maintains a distinctive lyric register with controlled rhythm ("continents of fog rolled and unrolled like slow pages") and a clear perceptual signature focused on transformation and translation. The prose modulates effectively during the ritual sequence, tightening during action ("She chose to climb") while expanding for sensory moments, with no POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with phrases like "inevitably whimsical gravity" and "striped like dawn." POV remains stable with Arin throughout. Elian's dialogue feels natural and carries subtext about artistic truth. However, some constructions strain clarity: "a curled sliver betraying an apology that saved two marriages and sank one war" compresses too much without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Lyra processes the world through frequencies, oscillations, and electromagnetic phenomena ("tasted like burnt sugar and regret"). Voice maintains technical precision under pressure without losing emotional texture. POV remains strictly limited to Lyra's knowledge, with the tricksters' intentions inferred through their signals rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("pressed her gloved hand against the cold stone archway") and selective perception focused on spatial and stellar imagery. Some passages drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV ("spatial mutiny," "wistful rebellion"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's methodical counting and measuring "the distance between cheekbone and grief." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("lance the silence that had thickened") and the abrupt ending that disrupts established rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction like "hummed with spongey dread" and "tattooed with coded stanzas." POV remains stable with Lila's perceptual signature evident in how she notices obsolete coastlines and interprets the station's responses.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("Below, the valley breathed fog like a sleeping dragon"). Perceptual signature shows in how the fiddler translates visual into musical ("playing the route his boots had traced").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Leo reads currency portraits as "strangers who had once believed," Mara reads denominations "as if they were runes." The prose modulates effectively from meditative opening to urgent ritual. Dialogue carries subtext well ("Not explain...mark").

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("understanding dawns like a slow tide"), though occasional register elevation ("irised open") slightly exceeds the POV's established range.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic details ("air tasted of damp parchment") and selective attention to phosphorescent, shifting text.

Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("conscience for hire," "sincerely insincere") but mostly serves the contemplative tone. The abrupt ending mid-sentence appears unintentional rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm: "rings from a stone she had not yet thrown were already spreading." The backwards temporal perspective is maintained consistently. However, the abrupt truncation ("each footfall er") damages voice integrity at the crucial final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled repetition of key phrases ("pulse left wandering," "centuries of layered dust") that accumulates meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains surreal precision with inventive compounds ("timeline cartographer," "chronal heat") and philosophical density. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("complementary opposites," "mutual recognition") that distances from embodied experience.

Dialogue from the brain and sensei reads more as conceptual pronouncement than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("where silence is storm-born") and specific perceptual signature (Mara notices architectural possibility, puzzle mechanics).

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Mara tracks "electromagnetic ghosts" and "shimmer of data," with controlled lyric compression that serves the accumulative mode. Rhythmic control evident in the "crashing hush" refrain. Minor dock for occasional register elevation ("constellation of light that spelled out coordinates") that slightly exceeds POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("counting out loud because the death certificate had insisted I had none"). The experimental compression and metaphorical density serve the accumulative pattern. Minor filter verb clustering in middle section prevents higher score.

    Distinct voice through inventive compounds ("odd-hour librarian," "analog memories") and controlled rhythm that modulates with the geometric shift. Perceptual signature strong in selective noticing (creaks, scarf weight, light color shifts).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature ("measured cloud shadows against coastline shadows") and consistent POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register—"Wind carried the bruised awe of a world that had already begun forgetting its own name." Perceptual signature remains consistent through selective, poetic observation.

The perceptual signature of someone hyper-aware of touch and impression is sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through grief ("benzyl alcohol rising like a benediction").

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinctive touches like "harmonious choral librarian" and "worm-geared planets." Yet the elevated diction sometimes drifts from Sora's established voice into abstraction ("empathetically decisive, understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric-scientific register appropriate to the helix-minded engineer.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Ari experiences the world primarily through scent ("corpse flower seed...like iron and funeral lilies"). Voice modulates from contemplative ("heartbeat older than the village") to sensory immersion ("fragrance so sweet it felt like forgiveness"). No dialogue appears, maintaining interior focus.

The prose modulates from controlled precision to dissolving boundaries as emotions leak. Perceptual signature strong in lines like "She tasted metal—someone else's courage." No dialogue to evaluate; internal consistency maintained despite reality's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Mira's nervous physicality and musical attention ("pulse," "rhythm," "hum").

Dialogue is minimal but effective when present.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains mystical register consistently with purposeful compression ("shifted hush," "frozen breath"). Some elevated diction borders on purple prose ("forgiven sin," "what the world pretends to be peels away") but serves the mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice through crystalline imagery and measured rhythm matches Elara's "gently meticulous" nature. The perceptual signature (seeing light as music, vows as frequencies) is consistent and character-specific.

    Perceptual signature shines: Hara notices rope textures, not scenery ("knot patterns by touch"). But "velvet pouches of rare grains" slightly overreaches lexicon for a collector; diction stays consistent under pressure though, with rhythmic shifts matching decoding intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature shines: "quaking reverie of heartbeat," limestone as "pale moths." Syntax modulates perfectly under pressure—short staccato during collapse ("The palace lurched; a stalactite snapped"). Minor filter-verb slip in "Halric felt" twice, but voice remains distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds like drifting kelp," "pulse match thunder") with rhythmic control under pressure—short syntax for child's cry ("thin as gull wings"), lyrical flow for closure. Elision (lightning scent evoking past fires) taught early and paid off. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates perfectly from "kelp-drift peace" to scar-song clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("colors shifting like thoughts too quick to name") and rhythmic control under pressure ("water coughed, then surged") shine. Minor flaw: "sidereal patience" repetition lacks sufficient variation, bordering on template cadence without meaningful evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("finger of coherent light," "modulation of pure frequency") sustains voice under pressure, but rhythmic density occasionally drifts into ornate abstraction ("bruise-blue humming with lullaby") risking POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("wings beat overhead like distant drums," "citrus and loam") modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression ("decades of being unspooled") is taught early and paid off in the ribbon's transformation. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally from Mara's throat tightening to the wider butterfly vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "fingertip worn smooth from winding" and sea-smoke imagery; rhythmic control peaks in "Click by click" winding sequence. Slight register drift in "ethically diligent" label lowers 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized air") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control shines in sparse climax sentences, though "feels the weight of every seed" slightly over-tells.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature shines: "vellum resisted, curling" mirrors cartographer’s struggle; rhythmic control in "roots teach soil" under pressure. Zero POV drift, with frost geometry revealing data as character-particular noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.7)
    Perceptual signature ("thistled calm," "submarine light") remains consistent under pressure. Compression taught early ("mist clung to broken columns like unfinished phrases") pays off in dust-book scene without scaffold; musical lexicon stays within copyist's plausible expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ashy petals of what had once been her lover’s charcoal portrait") and rhythmic control under pressure elevate lyric compression. Purposeful elision taught early pays off in closure, with zero head-hopping despite fragmented time.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature shines in "counting varves of silt the way monks once counted beads"; syntax modulates from lyrical ("brass teeth catching faint green glow") to stark ("I spat into the water") under pressure without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("geese crossed the sky in shifting chevrons") and rhythmic control elevate tension, though "expectantly resigned" repeats as filter-phrase, momentarily dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("copper veins," "burnt ozone") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control peaks in the match-strike moment where syntax compresses to mirror tension without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "streetlights daydreamed," "hush smelled of sugar and thunder." Rhythm modulates with ritual—longer cadences during sanctification, clipped phrases at climax ("tide pausing mid-breath"). Zero head-hopping; compression taught early ("cedar shingles silvered to moonlit water").

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("thought, warm as silt"; "petrified nerves") persists under pressure. Third-person limited POV stays welded to Aurele's telepathic reality without leakage, though "incisively kind" repetition slightly flattens rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "air tasted of chalk and iron, as though steps exhaled dust of erased proofs." Rhythmic control under pressure shifts from fragmented climbs to flowing equations, with no head-hopping despite temporal fluidity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature ("city like charcoal sketch someone tried to erase") shows character-particular noticing. Lyrical compression taught early ("saffron quiet") pays off in closure; zero register drift despite multiple characters' arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.8)
    Perceptual signature shines: "rosewater dread", "phosphorescent moss spelling ghost initials" filter world through Lysandra’s curator lens.

Zero head-hopping; elision (beekeeper’s absence) taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp ("salt fog settles on brass like frozen breath"), with rhythm modulating under pressure ("crooked increments—no steady climb"). Minor register drift in "unsponsored by any god" barely mars consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature thrives in stress: "cotton-candy rot" breath, "bruise colors" from flickering bulbs. Rhythmic compression during climax ("I lunged... wolf head snapped shut") modulates perfectly with pressure. Advisor's whispers carry subtext without diagnostic dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("clouds as pages," "citrus mist as euphony") and rhythmic control peak during reef transformation; non-standard punctuation ("dub the pattern she saw overhead into the wood") taught early and paid off in closure's sonic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Neris notices "micro-eddies of wind" and "hairline cracks," with rhythm tightening under pressure ("She played. The cracks raced."). Purposeful compression ("On the fourteenth day...") taught early pays off in closure's fragmented cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scallop bite of a cliff that had forgotten its own shape") and rhythmic control under pressure (shortening syntax at dawn) showcase mastery, though minor register drift in "hushed blaze of silence" slightly dilutes consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive" shown through methodical actions ("fingers grazing spines"), not labels. Rhythmic control under pressure—long sentences for discovery, clipped phrasing during vault entry ("heart steady in reclaimed stillness")—avoids uniform tics.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature defined by light-crafting lexicon ("refracting starlight," "distilled dawn"). Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during memory flood ("child coughing petals of blue fire"). Compression taught early (plague ships) pays off in closure's hope sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines in "circuit breakers sighed" anthropomorphism; rhythmic control under pressure evident in fragmented "She laughed, a sound like ice fracturing," though "intangibly tangible" repetition borders on tic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature evident in scent-driven noticing ("clove smoke voice," "saffron stolen from sphinx’s tears"), though "paradoxically steady" momentarily drifts toward abstraction without character-particular embodiment during high-pressure transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("lightning etched glass like signature no editor could erase") with rhythmic control, but "wind rearranged constellations into new alphabets" strains into mixed metaphor under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct—Lysandra notices "brass knuckles clicking like typewriter keys" and coded angles—while dialogue subtext ("answers like concealed blades") advances conflict. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure during fencing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    "Empirically whimsical" voice shines: tasting story pH, moss "humming like sleeping lute," and syntax tightening during dream-pressure ("pages began to curl, edges browning") create unmatched perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature shines in texture-driven diction ("vowels lingering like still dew," "resin of creased fingers"), with rhythm modulating under pressure. The Accumulative lens justifies the mist’s indirection, though a single line ("the separation as rhythmically placid") risks abstract description without embodied immediacy.
