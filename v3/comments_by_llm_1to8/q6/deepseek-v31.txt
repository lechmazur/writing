    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through scientific precision applied to grief: "strip needless drama from the loss, to reduce this personal catastrophe to a set of quantifiable variables." The prose rhythm modulates from clinical distance to wonder as she discovers "a cosmos" in the wing's scales.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—an artist's eye for patterns and light pervades the narration. Some passages achieve strong voice ("grammar of ascent"), though occasional register elevation ("calcined," "granular") slightly exceeds Lyra's established lexicon during stress.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with controlled scientific-poetic register appropriate to Elara's inventor-artist perspective, though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("cathedral-like structure," "unshaken marvels"). Strong perceptual signature in how she experiences the world through touch and sight rather than sound. Some filter verb clustering ("She focused," "She took," "She looked") slightly dulls immediacy in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with maritime vocabulary and undertaker's perspective on permanence. Clean POV control throughout. Some register elevation ("aqueous gloom," "kaleidoscope") slightly strains the established voice in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Kael's leadership-weighted observations—"dangerous emotion," "new kind of vulnerability." Free indirect style clean throughout. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "terra-cotta arbor" and "meager caches" that doesn't fully match the established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism - "camera obscura artist, a chronicler of light and shadow, and now a pilgrim of sparks." POV remains stable with appropriate interiority. Slight register elevation in places ("palimpsest of past and present") but mostly consistent with artist-narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's academic mindset ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry"). The perceptual signature shows her architect's eye noting structure and geometry. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("quaking reverie," "texture of time itself") but rhythm generally supports the dreamlike tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with selective perception ("Dust motes, thick as felt"). The sentry's brief dialogue carries subtext and threat. Some register elevation in phrases like "purest expression" feels slightly disconnected from the gritty setting.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and specific perceptual signature (synesthetic hearing of colors). Voice maintains literary register appropriate to the contemplative tone. Some filter verb accumulation ("She knew," "She felt") and occasional abstraction reduce immediacy. The prose texture is distinctive but occasionally overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elegance with phrases like "brute-force artist" and "quietly savvy," though occasionally tilts toward overwriting ("liquid mercury," "breathtaking substance"). POV remains stable with Elara's selective perception of security details and art. The narrative distance appropriately tightens during the escape sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's dramatic narration habit ("The artisan breathes life into the formless void") distinguishes her voice and reveals character. Some register drift occurs ("赋予 weight" appears unexplained; "thoughtfully spirited" feels workshopped). Perceptual signature shows in how she hears drips as symphony notes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("transformative acid," "disposable echo"), though some passages drift toward writerly abstraction. The Chinese character "潮汐" creates an unexplained rupture. Psychic distance modulates effectively during the dive sequence, tightening as panic rises.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in "dense tapestry of unsaid things" and syntax that mirrors contemplative pace ("She did not speak aloud; her hand moved"). The prose modulates with intensity—shorter phrases during the mapping, longer meditation at closure—though some abstract passages ("great unknown that the night merely hinted at") drift from the established concrete voice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through technical precision: "brushed-aluminum carapace," "multidigit manipulator," "audio receptors." Voice maintains clinical distance appropriate to robot consciousness while allowing moments of poetry like "the sound of spacetime being tuned."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signatures like Anya's reverence for silence and attention to archival detail. Diction appropriately matches an archivist's precision ("climate-controlled vaults," "transfer documents"). Some phrases feel overwrought ("mausoleum for whispers"), and the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("She was not destroying truth; she was choosing mercy") briefly breaks the showing mode.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Elara's gardener's eye - seeing "silver veins" in cracks, noticing "south hedge" specifics. Voice modulates effectively from meditative polishing to defensive speech. Minor deduction for Cederic's dialogue being slightly more functional than naturalistic ("This garden is a drain on resources").

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voices: Aris's "steady hum" of certainty versus Vesh's "clipped" skepticism shifting to breathless discovery. The perceptual signature shows through selective detail (Vesh notices the "eerie glow," Aris focuses on technical calibration). Minor convergence when both characters' dialogue becomes similarly hushed/whispered during the climactic moment slightly weakens distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with musical metaphors organic to Elara's perspective ("unstruck chords," "resonant frequency"). Some filter phrases could be trimmed ("She felt, rather than heard"), and occasional overwriting appears ("symphonious shudder"). The perceptual signature stays rooted in musical awareness throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with sophisticated vocabulary appropriate to the scientific observer. Strong perceptual signature in how Rhys notices peripheral details ("every dust mote dancing").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with phrases like "tonight's menu was a century of neglect" and "drowsy alertness." POV maintains appropriate skeptical-to-believer arc. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("velvet silence," "skeletal remains") slightly exceeds character's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("placid lake," "convulsed," "regenerative silence"). The perceptual signature of someone who experiences reality through textual metaphors is consistent, though occasional phrases like "crumbling peace" feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent limited third POV with controlled psychic distance. "Mellow," "softly adaptive," and nature-focused diction maintain Silas's therapeutic voice. Some elevated diction ("gossamer," "premature violet twilight") slightly strains the established register but serves atmospheric purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("bronze quiet," "density of silence") that modulates effectively with discovery. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature, though occasional register elevation ("metaphysical tilting") slightly strains the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled literary register appropriate to the contemplative tone. Strong perceptual signature in Eli's observations. Minor weakness in Lena's limited dialogue and interiority, which doesn't fully distinguish her voice from the narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent theological-philosophical register appropriate to Father Ansel's perspective. Some passages achieve genuine distinction ("a sculpture of writhing shadows"). However, dialogue is minimal and some descriptive phrases lean toward the ornate without full payoff ("decorates with silence" works thematically but feels slightly forced).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic rendering ("conducting unheard symphonies"), with controlled modulation from contemplative opening to urgent conducting to exhausted acceptance. Minor register elevation in places ("cathedral of silence and refracted starlight") but maintains coherence. The POV's musical-temporal perception stays consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the concept, with controlled psychic distance throughout Kael's interior journey. However, several passages drift into elevated diction ("torturous beauty," "excruciating contrast") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through vibration and tactile sensation ("jagged tremor," "physical heat," "tiny, frantic vibration"). Voice maintains consistency even under emotional pressure at the recital. Minor deduction for occasional elevation into more writerly register ("magnificent answer," "profound attention") that slightly exceeds Inara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific precision ("meticulous storm recorder," "seismic echoes of subterranean drilling") that reflects Elara's analytical mind, with controlled modulation under stress. The perceptual signature—seeing patterns in data others miss—drives the plot. Slight register elevation in peak moments ("corrosive lie") doesn't quite match the established restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical language ("broker of lanterns," "captured glow"). Some elevated diction ("olfactory equivalent," "unadulterated joy") occasionally strains but serves the piece's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through philosophical wanderer's lens ("texture of time," "cascade of decisions") with controlled psychic distance. The elevated register fits Aris's poet identity, though occasional abstractions ("profound, destabilizing gifts") could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through acoustic focus—"acoustical texture," "layer of absence," "weight and frequency"—maintains throughout. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external description to intimate revelation, though occasional elevated diction ("leviathan," "mendicant") slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic quirk and technical precision; voice modulates from clinical detachment to lyrical recognition in the grotto. Prose rhythm accelerates during discovery sequence. Minor filter verb clustering ("She realized," "She understood") in middle section prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent formality matching Elias's broker profession. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("The Dvorak was particularly moving"). Some register elevation feels forced ("star-dusted sky," "tapestry of celestial light"). The POV remains stable and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with artistic perception filtering details ("calloused from weaving," "luminescent ache"). Some elegant moments of free indirect style. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't match Kaelin's established voice and minimal dialogue that could have added texture.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "cascading silence" and "a silence that stung the ears." The Warden's dialogue as "a chorus of every possible age" shows creative voice work. Some passages lean toward overwriting ("manifestation of pure chronology") but the overall texture supports the story's ethereal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with mathematical precision ("elegant logic," "precise equations") though some passages drift toward purple prose. POV remains stable. However, register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's established lexicon ("gossamer formulae," "moon-kissed hills").

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's tactile navigation and her reception of the sense memory. The prose modulates effectively from methodical description to visceral memory flood, though occasional filter phrases ("She understood," "she felt") slightly distance key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third POV with scientific precision shifting to more receptive language as Aris transforms. Some elegant phrasing ("circuitously sincere in its journey"). Deductions for occasional register drift into overly writerly territory ("reluctant metamorphosis," "felt experience") and some filter-verb clustering that dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("knuckle of rock," "latent, internal light"). POV stays anchored to Kaelen with clean free indirect style. The woman's dialogue feels slightly underdeveloped, though "Called out to it" carries appropriate mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with selective perception - Elara notices the "steady thrum of his heart, a rhythm that felt steadily unpredictable." The musical descriptions match the setting's demands. Minor weakness: dialogue lacks subtext, particularly the pilgrim's overly direct declaration of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting an archivist-scholar. Phrases like "salt-tang of the air a familiar ghost upon her tongue" and "The emptiness was a chart she had to read" show distinct texture. Some moments edge toward overwrought ("reactively visionary part of her mind, sparked by the telling itself") but generally the prose serves the story's contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "lattice of measured lines" matching Elara's analytical nature. POV is stable throughout. Some register elevation in places ("cathedral of quiet mystery") slightly strains the established voice but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice blends cosmic scope with intimate perception ("silence so profound it hummed," "measured eternity in grains of sand"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("magnificent fury," "ferocious energy") that slightly exceeds established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's mathematical/transactional lens ("cold and constant calculation," "mathematics of a fair trade") that shapes how she processes grief. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity—clinical precision gives way to "liquefied" thinking. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("deathly vitality") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"granular shift of epochs," "resonance, a key"—with controlled modulation from contemplative opening to ecstatic visions to "quiet, radiant fulfillment." No dialogue needed; interior voice maintains consistency. The prose rhythm accelerates during vision sequences then settles for descent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice filters reality through absence—"seeing not what was present but what was missing." Perceptual signature consistent in phrases like "null set in the world's vast ledger" and "tapestry of absence." Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly the clerk's warning that "Some stories aren't meant to be found" which confirms without stating.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision softening into wonder. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("profound, ancient loneliness") slightly strains the established voice. The perceptual signature of a scientist noting specific details (ephemeral compass glow, single string) is distinctive but occasionally lapses into abstraction.

    Voice maintains consistent texture with phrases like "culture shock absorber" and "floating borough." POV filters setting through Rio's specific lens. Some register elevation in peak moments ("defiant, joyous sound against the vast, darkening sea") slightly exceeds established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm—"slow-motion wave of darkness extinguishing." Some elevated diction ("magnificent desolation," "ethereal glow") fits the elegiac tone. The perceptual signature of noticing radioactive signatures and dissolution chemistry is character-specific. Minor drift toward writerly constructions in places.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV maintains consistent close third with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("a chaotic, buzzing poem"). Some phrases drift toward writerly register ("magnetic calm settled," "relentless, patient grace") that slightly distance from Elara's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice combining technical precision ("precise coordinates of its stoop") with poetic observation ("breath a persistent ghost"). The perceptual signature of a mapmaker noting patterns and inversions remains consistent throughout. Some filter verbs ("She tracked," "drew her attention") slightly dull immediacy in places but serve the observational mode.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm evident in constructions like "a place of dust and bone held in a wild hush." The perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences the town through sound and vibration rather than sight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "frail trespasser" beam and navigation through "alien constellations." Some register elevation during pressure ("nexus of instinct," "grotesque scar") slightly exceeds POV lexicon. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to internal realization when touching the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mythic register maintains consistency with phrases like "wharf weaver" and "orchid solace," creating a distinct texture. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("sewed the air itself"), but the voice coheres around Thea's poetic perception and the story's fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that modulates with scene needs—swift during chalk-drawing, contemplative during reflection. The perceptual signature is distinct: Kael notices textures, margins, paradoxes. Minor filter verb clustering ("He thought of," "He looked down") prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, atmospheric prose fitting the medieval fantasy setting. Elara's dialogue carries appropriate wisdom-keeper register ("Watch the light, my Prince"). Some filter verb usage ("She saw," "He watched") slightly dulls immediacy, and occasional register elevation feels unmotivated by POV.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's focus on objects' histories and the lyrical register suits the medium character. Some filter verb clustering ("She saw," "She held") in peak moments slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "chemical sea" and "lotus-hearted ache," though some register elevation ("fractal maze," "neural lightning") slightly exceeds the POV's established voice. Clean psychic distance shifts from operating room to memory. Dialogue is minimal but effective—Elara's whispered words to Kaito carry genuine subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception fitting a visual artist—"moved through it like a ghost," "canvas was the city itself." POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation in phrases like "pensive mirth" and "metaphorically" slightly disrupts the otherwise embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)

    Distinct perceptual signature in how Aeliana notices the library's "milk-white stone" and "crystallized joy." Voice maintains lyrical control through pressure, though some moments edge toward elevated register ("sublime, aching beauty"). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct academic voice with controlled register - "perpetual student of the dead," "tangled knot of implied subtext." Some filter verbs ("she noticed," "she saw") slightly dull immediacy in the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through Isla's expertise ("calloused thumb," "calibrated分流 channels"). Narrative distance remains stable in close third. Minor inconsistency with the Chinese character "分流" appearing unexplained in otherwise English prose.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice filters perception through preservation concerns ("paper trail," "echo of lost songs") with controlled modulation from meditative ritual to trembling discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical precision ("fractured hush," "wisp of a girl") that maintains consistency. The perceptual signature—focusing on texture, light, angles—fits the architect's daughter. Some elevated diction ("featherly determined") occasionally strains the POV's naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("untethered souls," "shadowseam wonder") that mostly serves the underwater atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains firefighter-specific perception ("crown igniting," "hose line," "firebreak") with controlled modulation from technical precision to lyric meditation. The selective noticing—focusing on the box's crack, the stars' slow dance—reflects character psychology. Minor register drift in "alchemized into meaning" doesn't quite fit the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's contemplative nature. Phrases like "cartographer of impossibilities" and "poem of cause and effect" fit the character's mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains elevated register appropriate to the cosmic scope with phrases like "slow, ponderous dance" and "thick and syrupy" time. Some passages drift toward abstract diction ("incalculable cost," "terrible price") that could be more embodied, though the perceptual signature remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's selective attention to geological detail and the egg's texture. Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. The "chaos变量" appears to be a technical error rather than intentional, and some phrases edge toward purple prose ("fractured grace," "ossified tear"), preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("stark contradiction in silk and resolve"). Some register drift into abstract philosophy ("terrifying quiet of a blank page") slightly disconnects from Elara's embodied perspective. Strong perceptual signature in how she experiences threads as memories. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's attention to texture, precision, and silence ("meteor hush," "ink as black as the void").

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Silas's esoteric observer role—"transiently rooted," "verdant grotto," "blushing stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with technical precision befitting a craftsperson: "minute pressures and precise heats." The perceptual signature focuses on tactile and material details. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("snowmelt ardor," "sacred act") that slightly diverges from the otherwise grounded technical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through technical-poetic fusion ("ghost-whispers," "dream-shards") with consistent POV modulation. Voice maintains "precisely playful" tone even under pressure. Minor weakness in the slightly elevated register during transcendence that drifts from established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature of an astronomer parsing patterns and seeking rules. Strong modulation as frustration builds ("a foreign feeling"). The shift from analytical to embodied perception in "not to calculate, but to feel" marks clear psychic distance change. Slight deduction for "empirically ironic" feeling forced into the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voices - Lyra's gentle insistence versus Kael's weary authority. The prose modulates from philosophical ("profound, palpable void") to urgent during confrontation. Minor convergence in register during peak moment ("archive of his own flesh") slightly elevated for context.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's technical precision ("geometry of light," "synchronized self"). Perceptual signature strong in selective technical focus. Some filter verb clustering ("She knew," "She remembered," "She found it") in middle section dulls immediacy. Final section recovers with strong rhythmic control during the synchronization sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("gaze softened by a lifetime of peering into fractured souls"). Dialogue differentiates generations naturally, though some phrases like "endearingly feisty" and "accidental wisdom" feel slightly workshopped rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("sanctum built to house the whispers of the past") that matches Elara's curator perspective. Effective modulation during the vision sequence maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)

    Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization through Ayla. Strong perceptual signature in how she notices time's texture in minute details.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's claustrophobic lens: "walls getting closer," gravity as the "only force that held the world together."

    Distinct voice with controlled register ("cold calculus of false promises," "sub-audible thrum"). The perceptual signature stays consistent through stress, maintaining Elara's wary-but-curious perspective. Minor syntax repetition in middle section ("She had to... She was going to...") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated fantasy register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in descriptive passages like "threads of pure, solidified light."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through archival focus ("familiar ache," "reverent" movements) with controlled modulation as emotion intensifies.

    Leo's perceptual signature filters everything through technical assessment ("wear on a sheave wheel," "alignment of guide rails"), creating a distinct professional lens that makes his supernatural sight more credible.

    Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through Elara's selective noticing ("streetlights daydreaming," "hushed blaze"), with rhythm modulating effectively from contemplative observation to ritual intensity. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal consistency holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature of stone consciousness ("slow, grinding thoughts") with controlled psychic distance throughout. Purposeful compression and elevated diction serve the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception like "night-blooming silence" and "the city's noon-time roar." The prose modulates effectively between present action and the daydream sequence. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—"I remembered" carries significant subtext about the persistence of kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with distinct perceptual signature ("curated," "historically oriented"). Some effective modulation under stress ("Each droplet of meltwater felt like a century passing"). Occasional filter verbs and slight elevation in diction ("pervasive sense of rosewater dread") that doesn't fully match crisis urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive diction ("bleak exhilaration," "cold fire in his veins") that mirrors Eliran's obsessive precision. Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("fleeting, dizzying view") but the perceptual signature—focusing on mechanical detail while time unravels—remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature with selective detail (Elias notices textures, light, decay). Voice modulates appropriately under stress—shorter sentences during the confession sequence. The whispering advisor's dialogue carries effective subtext about the nature of the curse. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("Elias felt") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with elevated register appropriate to the prophet character - "luminous indigo of the blue hour." Some purple prose edges toward overwriting ("restless euphony," "fractal generating core") but remains controlled. Perceptual signature is consistent in how Kaelen reads weather as music. Minor register drift in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with appropriate lexicon for a cartographer. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads patterns and spirals.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent academic precision with controlled emotional undertow ("his feelings a distant hum beneath a glacier of focus"). Elara's dialogue carries appropriate weariness and specificity. However, some register elevation feels unmotivated ("cathedral of neglect," "crucible") and the narrative occasionally explains what's shown ("her voice echoing softly" after establishing the vast space).

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ansel's perceptual signature—measuring voids, documenting "negative space of laughter"—creates a distinct voice. The prose modulates effectively from his solitary precision to the shared recognition with Elara. Dialogue carries subtext well: "I measure what's left behind" reveals character through indirection. Minor convergence occurs when both characters speak of dreams with similar register.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent erudite register appropriate to Silas's profession - "cross-references and meticulously maintained ledges."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with effective modulation during the awakening sequence ("not with his eyes, but with his mind").

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent third-limited with selective perception ("dust motes dancing like slow-motion fireworks") that reflects Elara's aerial perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphors ("slab of dark glass," "dusk began to bleed"). Dialogue feels natural in the confession scene.

    Distinct perceptual signature with naval terminology ("container ships," "bearing," "navigator") and measured, reflective rhythm that suits Elias's melancholic state. The "merrily melancholic" paradox manifests in syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the fairy-tale setting, with effective modulation during the memory sequence ("not a loud rip, but a soft sigh").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "choking beauty") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature of a mystic seeking temporal truth comes through in selective details. Minor moments of slight overwriting ("infinite desert," "star-dusted sky") don't significantly harm the overall voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency through technical-poetic register appropriate to an AI consciousness. Some filter-verb clustering ("it felt," "it had") in middle sections dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to fantasy with phrases like "marrow of his bones" and "obsidian monolith." POV remains stable in close third, with Lysander's perception filtering events. Dialogue between Lysander and Vorlag carries subtext effectively, though limited to brief exchanges. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that borders on purple ("profound dark").

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction matching the mythic scope: "the elusive eel herder who lived on the high tidal bluff." POV remains stable in close third. Some filter verb accumulation ("He saw the patterns," "he could have jumped") slightly dulls immediacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "cartography of scars" and "furiously tranquil," though occasionally tips into overwriting. The perceptual signature - Elara's poet's eye for metaphor - stays consistent, and the lack of dialogue serves the isolated vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV through Valerius with controlled, formal diction matching the philosophical protagonist. "Diplomatically fierce" and "dignified chaos" show distinctive voice choices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "moon-dust" and "luminous fracture" maintains consistency, though some elevated diction ("cathedral," "inscribe") slightly strains the vagrant poet's register.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with musical metaphors ("reading the silences between notes," "dissonant melody"). POV maintains close third with controlled distance. Minor weakness in the conductor's dialogue which could carry more subtext—"We've tried everything" reads slightly generic for the crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled diction ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt") that maintains consistency. The dream sequence shows skilled psychic distance modulation. Minor register elevation in places ("profound translation") but generally maintains Elara's scholarly-yet-wondering perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with effective modulation during the compass sequence. Some elevated diction ("cerulean regret," "rhythmically placid") occasionally feels imposed rather than emerging from POV. Elara's dialogue carries authentic subtext about patience and listening.

    Distinct painterly voice ("waxing moon’s glow," "grit of industry") with pressure-appropriate compression, though "methodically hopeful" violates BRR by exceeding reflection limits without altering present action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines: "green glow... lodestar" reflects curator’s visual bias; rhythm compresses under waterfall’s roar. Bread’s "crispy G and C" avoids filter verbs while anchoring tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("oil and grit" fingers, "cold fire" energy) with rhythmic control during device activation, but verbatim "bleak exhilaration" repetition creates syntactic monotony in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature distinct ("repulsive allure of surroundings"); rhythmic control shifts from fragmented terror to measured resolve during paradox writing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature crystallizes in cloud interpretation ("sketched resonance of world’s deep music"). Rhythm modulates flawlessly: short phrases during storm ("wind began to keen") versus lyrical calm post-crescendo. Zero POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature distinct: cartographer notices "library of spirals," "calcium curves." Rhythm modulates under pressure ("dreadful, necessary one"). Zero head-hopping; stress compresses diction cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices pigments/script, not emotions. Under stress, syntax tightens ("Logic warred... scholar’s drive won"). Single POV stable; "conceptual cost" register drift minor. Elara's dialogue carries subtext through evidence, not pleading.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("hushed blaze," "skeletal stone ribs") filters all description through Ansel’s archeological sensitivity. Rhythmic control modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during the scrape sound), with Elara’s dialogue carrying subtext that deepens theme without violating POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "minute groans" and "rhythm of breath" reflecting his tranquilly perceptive nature. Rhythmic control shifts from measured cataloging ("brass handle of a specific drawer") to urgent discovery ("heart beat a little faster") under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature (craftsman's tactile focus); rhythmic control in folding sequence. Minor register drift in "shattering sorrow gilded by beauty" risks overwriting but paid off in closure's simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.6)
    Perceptual signature crystallizes in "heat ghosts" and "stress points"—Kaelen’s fractured psyche shapes sensory selectivity; rhythmic control intensifies during awakening ("unfiltered awakening tore through him") with no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: genealogist notices "grooves" and "crests," with syntax compressing under stress ("Regret... no longer tempered"). Rhythmic control varies—flowing for reflection, staccato for climax ("He demanded..."). Zero POV leakage; "sieved hush" metaphor is character-particular, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature excels: Elara notices tactile details (slick stones, numb hands) reflecting her thoughtful nature. "Emotional arithmetic" slightly drifts from POV lexicon, but rhythmic control in the closure beat ("Then we understand it... let it go") is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines in sailor-specific details ("choppy water," "wires humming"); rhythmic control mirrors paddling cadence, though "flickering faith" repetition slightly dilutes pressure in reflection beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature in clinical yet poetic diction ("synaptic scrub," "jaded wonder"). Rhythmic control under pressure via fragments ("A flicker of light...") and layered clauses. Purposeful elision (geologist’s backstory) taught early and paid off in rescue beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("silvered petals glowing with internal light", "cold, silver fire") modulates rhythm under pressure. "Cosmic intimacy" slightly abstract but redeemed by sensory precision in rift sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "choking beauty" and ink-as-river metaphors; rhythmic control under pressure ("swirled backwards... vision faded") taught early and paid off in closure’s lyrical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "quantum signature of tears" and gravitational metaphors. Rhythmic control peaks in climax ("pushed not with engines... but with entirety of its being"), compressing time without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice modulates effectively with pressure (e.g., "vibrant hush" to "true peaceful silence"), but peak moments lapse into abstraction ("profound, unquenchable need"). Perceptual signature weakens during the climax, losing character-specific diction for lyrical generality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.7)
    Perceptual signature shines in "counting carved lines only he knew" and stress-modulated syntax; dialogue carries subtext without voice convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature shines via scientific-poetic duality ("lightening veined the clouds," chemical precision), though "cartography of scars" slightly drifts from plausible lexicon. Rhythmic control under stress (shortened syntax in blackout) avoids ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature shines in Valerius' tool-focused noticing ("polished steel glinting," "painted arcs traced with human fingers"). Voice modulates from analytical ("profound and deliberate purpose") to visceral ("clattering across the stones") under pressure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "practiced, tender hands" on shredded Whitman. Rhythm modulates from "cold light made ghosts" to urgent "pried at it... false bottom gave way." No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ghostly goodbyes," "percussive knock") modulates under pressure, but conductor’s voice lacks idiom differentiation in sparse dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct "empirically whimsical" voice filters all perception ("dusty work," instruments "whirred skeptically"); rhythmic control deepens under monsoon pressure with zero POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Kaelen’s sensory filter: "cerulean regret," "aged bark" expressions, and lace’s "looped" breaths reflect his grief. Rhythmic control under pressure ("needle spun wildly before settling") avoids head-hopping; compression taught early pays off in closure.
