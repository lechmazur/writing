    Mara's scientific voice maintains consistent technical precision ("diffraction grating," "interference fringes," "counts per second") that reflects her mental state of imposed objectivity. The perceptual signature—noticing microscopic scales and spectral shifts while dismissing human drama—is character-specific and unwavering. Voice modulates subtly under the "kindled humility" moment but quickly returns to clinical observation, maintaining POV discipline throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice employs purposeful compression and lyric density ("air so cold it rang," "canyon under stars kept its silence"). The perceptual signature—a glass artist reading the world through temperature, light, and material transformation—remains consistent. No dialogue appears, maintaining the interior focus throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("heat-mapping emotions scanner," "twelve forks ranging from whale-low to bat-high") that maintains consistency.

    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("dropped star," "we will echo inside our bones") that maintains consistency without overwriting. Third-person limited POV stays cleanly with Mara throughout, with selective perception reflecting her priorities. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("cognitive smoothness") that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature manifests in synesthetic descriptions ("tasted purple," "foggy lucidity") and selective attention to breath/flowering. The lyric voice maintains consistency through spiritual-poetic register. Dialogue serves as compressed action ("I lost the address of the love I never gave"). Minor moments of elevated diction ("medicinal," "reciprocal duty") align with the pilgrim's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency with phrases like "corridors that folded inward, infinite and glowing" and "the garden behind her sighed." The perceptual signature shows Elara experiencing reality through design metaphors (spirals, curves, gates). Some moments edge toward purple prose ("luminous than light") but generally serve the dreamlike tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with inventive phrasing like "patient as drought-grass" and consistent POV control, though some moments drift into elevated register ("staggering grace") that doesn't match the grounded narrator. Dialogue limited to one line but effectively uses carnival language to unsettle guards.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with distinctive perceptual signature—Mara experiences the world through synesthetic translation ("heard the forge as a slow cello"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("aurora faded to bruised pearl") that occasionally distances from immediate experience, but rhythm control supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("satchel heavy with stolen faces") and consistent magical realist register. Some passages suffer from elevated diction that obscures clarity ("luminous disbelief" appears twice), and dialogue mechanics could be cleaner in the exchange scene.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong perceptual signature through Mara's glassblower expertise shapes what she notices (materials, heat, structural possibilities). Her dramatic narration device ("Behold, the pilgrim unscrews...") creates distinctive voice that modulates effectively with emotional beats. The rhythm accelerates appropriately toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains distinctive stunt-double perception ("reel," "take," "frame," "places") with controlled metaphorical density. Perceptual signature shows in how Leo reads the world through film terminology and physical fear responses. Some elevated diction ("palimpsest," "obsolete film cans moldered") occasionally drifts from Leo's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("coastlines of an endless night whose tides were minutes"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative design, teaching its pattern early. Minor instances of elevated diction ("transpose itself") slightly exceed the oracle's established register but don't harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains clinical precision appropriate to a robot narrator while allowing moments of wonder ("a note that sounded like the moment before creation"). No dialogue keeps focus tight on interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close-third POV with selective perception ("the hush breathe back at her"). Some elevated diction ("crystal whispering forecourt") fits the quiet registrar's contemplative nature. Dialogue feels slightly staged but carries necessary subtext about fear and frozen relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "withered vine dresser" and "living labyrinth," creating a fable-like register appropriate to the magical realist concept.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent dream-logic ("time moves sideways," "the station's own mechanically warm bellows") with purposeful compression that teaches its pattern early. The perceptual signature - focusing on magnetic pulses, wing-beats, and thermal contradictions - creates a distinct texture, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("holographic principles encoded").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with occasional effective moments like "he somehow knew contained her voice." However, prose sometimes drifts into abstraction and the narrative voice lacks distinctive texture. Several instances of telling rather than showing ("offering him the choice," "permission to exist") weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic blending ("tasting...auroral light," "chlorophyll sorrow"). Voice modulates from fever-dream opening to clinical final entry. Consistent liminal focalization catches peripheral shadows and half-glimpsed certainties without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("beneath the hush of dreaming roots"). Perceptual signature is consistent, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("cautious exuberance" of air). The long sentences maintain rhythm without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("the way a tuning fork feels after the last note has gone"). Perceptual signature shows in how she reads objects—feeling walls, probing with sable brush. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("bronze quiet," "copper glow") but serve the textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with distinctive phrasings ("transpose life into a new key," "familiar enigma"). POV distance is well-calibrated, accessing Chen's interiority while maintaining mystery. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, particularly the keeper's casual ignorance contrasting with Chen's deeper knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive voice blends liturgical gravity with technical precision ("dimensional anchor," "acoustically naked"). The experimental approach maintains coherence throughout. Slight register elevation in places ("sagging vowels," "hinges squeak") fits the metaphysical tenor without breaking POV.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression—"the ache of being chronologically homesick" exemplifies the unique register. POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The prose modulates effectively with urgency (shorter fragments as exhaustion approaches). Minor weakness in occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match the intimate POV ("Devonian tides," "parabolic curves").

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric density ("boots leaving no prints on the wet stone," "runes pulsing like dying stars"). Perceptual signature strong throughout with selective attention to temporal anomalies. Clean POV control with no head-hopping. The prose rhythm effectively modulates with pressure, accelerating during the fracture sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—Mara experiences the world through vibration and touch rather than sound. The prose modulates effectively from the opening's hushed atmosphere through the intensifying sensory work to the resolved ending. Sign language exchanges are handled elegantly without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("wind shear to the third decimal") and lyrical moments ("sky bruised into violet").

    Distinctive perceptual signature with Mara hearing condensation as "minor seventh begging resolution" and the greenhouse teaching "how to let go" through flattening echoes. Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression. Minor rhythmic monotony in some passages but strong control during the musical sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature tracks Lira's professional assessment shifting to vulnerable experience. The prose modulates from controlled observation to sensory immersion during transformation. Minor wobble in the chemist's dialogue ("You'll feel what they felt. But not why.") reads slightly stilted against the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature with Marisol noticing maritime details and viewing interactions through a broker's lens of ledgers and cycles. Prose modulates effectively between contemplative library moments and active delivery sequence. Minor dialogue between Marisol and Beto feels natural with appropriate indirection. Some filter verb accumulation ("felt," "sensing") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice combines poetic compression ("starlight passed through it like breath through teeth") with specific craft details. Some register elevation feels slightly detached from Lira's POV during emotional peaks. The unfinished final sentence works as purposeful elision but feels abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register ("liquid lace," "silverfish fleeing a net") that maintains consistency through emotional peaks. The cadence breathing pattern (4-2-7, then 5-0-5) creates rhythmic control that mirrors the story's musical theme. Clean third-person limited with no head-hopping, though occasional elevated diction ("audible memories") slightly exceeds naturalistic bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with mathematical perception ("vectors of longing," "the mathematics of emotion") that remains consistent throughout. Some elevated diction like "locus of possible intersections" occasionally strains but mostly serves the conjurer's scholarly perspective. The perceptual signature of seeing emotion through mathematical lens is maintained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's infrastructure-focused attention ("mapping every joist and conduit") and sensory-rich fragment descriptions. Third-person limited maintains clean focalization throughout. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("constellation of voices warming the air") that slightly exceeds Elias's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a distinct botanical-scientific register that supports character—"cataloging growth patterns and nutrient cycles"—with effective modulation during the transformation. Some passages show repetitive syntactic patterns ("She [verb], then [verb]"), and occasional register drift into overly elevated diction during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and strong perceptual signature in how Mara notices patterns and artistic details. Some effective free indirect moments like "Another dawn, another failure" capture her voice. Deduction for occasional register drift into overly polished observations ("microscopic life that would evolve to thrive") that exceed the exhausted painter's likely articulation and for dialogue that occasionally sounds written rather than spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains a mythic register appropriate to the fable-like premise, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "hair white as salt petals." Some passages drift into abstraction ("overlapping shadows cast from crystals that existed in more than three dimensions") that strain clarity. The seer's dialogue feels suitably oracular, though the pilgrim lacks distinctive speech patterns beyond silence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("every cobblestone a word washed away"). The perceptual signature filters everything through archival metaphors. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I kept the mouthpiece to remember how exile tastes").

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature of an "analytically artistic mind" mapping invisible rails while throat trembles. Some register elevation in peak moments ("starlit vault in mist condensing") strains against established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with poetic compression ("leviathan breaths echoed like drumbeats") and consistent third-person limited POV. Some register elevation in phrases like "sculpt space for reflection" and "continued becoming" slightly strains the intimate voice established elsewhere. Strong perceptual signature in how Mara experiences the memories and whale song.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sandcastles—fun for a moment, then merely grit between toes"). POV remains stable. Some register elevation in peak moments ("unmarked, unmeasured, unruled") doesn't quite match established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent close third-person POV with strong perceptual signature ("granite policies into negotiable vapor"). Dialogue between Cassidy and Rurik carries appropriate subtext and tension. Minor deduction for some moments where diction elevates beyond Cassidy's seventeen-year-old voice ("refrigerated smile") and occasional filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("footprints recording minutes the way a sunday records hymns") and consistent perceptual signature focused on textures and craft materials. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the transformation sequence while maintaining the narrator's archival attention to detail.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("death certificate error survivor whose pulse still startled dockhands"). Perceptual signature filters everything through the lens of erasure and reconstruction. Purposeful compression and patterned elision work within the accumulative mode. The metaphorical density serves pressure without becoming opaque, maintaining consistent POV throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the mythic scope—phrases like "boots crunching on glass that once measured starlight" show strong perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the resurrection sequences. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match Arlen's pragmatic debunker origins.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive voice through inventive compression: "every dusk, strings of bulbs flickered on to keep the dark from remembering land prices." Perceptual signature strong in how Lina reads corporate colors as "wrong." The fire-eater's burning cursive and children speaking "only in riddles" maintains surreal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The perceptual signature is distinctly scientific-elegiac: "translucent polyps," "vein of feldspar," "bioluminescent regret." Voice modulates effectively from technical field notes to the emotional crack on "intervention," maintaining controlled distance even in grief. The prose rhythm accelerates during the blooming sequence ("fired the shutter once, twice, three times") while preserving the inspector's measured observation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through Lira's light-reading creates unique POV texture. Some moments trend toward over-explanation ("To decode feedback into direction, she must teach..."). Dialogue is functional but Col's voice lacks distinction beyond nervousness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Maren's cartographic attention to patterns, coordinates, and language. Voice modulates effectively from dry observation to wonder during the descent. Some filter verbs ("she watched," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy in middle beats.

    Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register and strong perceptual signature ("ghost town's silence...coiling through sagging roofs"). Excellent rhythmic control, particularly in the ritual sequences. POV remains stable with clean focalization throughout. Minor moments of elevated diction ("infinitely patient") fit the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical precision with distinctive phrasing like "exiled cartographer turned signal-sender" and "memories being touched, brushed by invisible curators." The controlled, contemplative rhythm matches Mira's methodical nature under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices technical details (copper coil, radio mast) alongside sensory poetry (lilac drop "spherical and luminous").

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression ("salt-stung balcony," "copperlight repose") with mythic register appropriate to fable-like material.

No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with selective perception ("fossilized petals," "oxidized copper eyes"). The caretaker's single line of dialogue carries appropriate wariness and youth. Some mild register elevation in "cautious enchantment thick as honey" but it serves the accumulative texture rather than disrupting voice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("pseudonyms fluttering behind her like torn pages") and consistent third-person limited POV. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("tiny planet orbiting her hesitation") but mostly maintain appropriate register. The perceptual signature of someone obsessed with naming and identity comes through in selective details.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("thread fibers crackling") and controlled psychic distance. The recursive phrasing ("flame from eternal candle," "echoed silence") creates textural coherence, though some constructions feel artificially elevated ("galaxy-chart embroiderer pressed").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive lyrical voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression ("salt and lullaby," "fierce tenderness wrapped in barnacle"). The mystical elements integrate smoothly into the narrator's perception without breaking voice. Strong perceptual signature in how guilt colors observation. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established range.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through medical-poetic fusion ("anesthetic hummed through my veins like distant shelling") and translator's attention to language layers.

Minor repetition in descriptive patterns prevents 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with lyric compression ("fog that drowned," "palette in hand") and consistent POV control. Some register elevation strains in places ("conspiratorial wink," "pensive mirth") but the perceptual signature remains specific to an artist who sees in light and color.

    Distinctive voice with controlled magical-realist register maintaining consistency through escalating surrealism. Strong perceptual signature in how Liora notices restoration details (rabbit-skin glue, tesserae, pigment). Clean focalization despite reality-bending events.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice combining scholarly diction ("candidly cryptic," "Lucretius") with rebellious energy. POV control mostly strong, though brief omniscient slip in final paragraph ("every citizen walking past would feel").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") and controlled lyric register throughout. Some register elevation in peak moments ("photosynthesizing inside the shell, converting every sleepless hour") strains against accessibility but remains purposeful. The perceptual signature of an exhausted poet viewing time in centuries holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric voice maintains consistency with inventive compounds like "glass-orchid," "tear-cities," and "foxglove regret."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with inventive compounds like "sea-foam recollectionist" and "cheerful gloom," creating distinct texture. POV control wavers slightly when describing the migrating bird's "eternal journey" and "bittersweet knowledge"—claims beyond the focalizer's access.

Some elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings") occasionally strains but mostly serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on fire/burn imagery. Some elevated diction ("celestial bodies performed their slow dance") occasionally drifts from Elias's working-class firefighter lexicon, and filter constructions accumulate in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice blends scientific precision ("equations," "variables," "consensus reality") with lyrical imagery ("silk the color of dawn before language"). POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("unopened mornings") but the overall texture supports the dreamlike premise.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with architectural/photographic lexicon ("silver halide," "developing trays," "negative space") that supports the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and distinctive voice mixing lyrical description with concrete action. Some elevated diction ("dusky harmony," "prismatic properties") fits the magical realist tone. Deduction for occasional filter-heavy passages ("She understood then") and the abrupt truncation that breaks voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness, relying on abstract elevated diction ("ritual significance," "flawed beauty") that creates distance rather than immediacy. The POV control is stable but the perceptual signature remains generic—any negotiator could narrate these observations without character-specific filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "The salt flat stretched like a shattered mirror beneath the lull of distant thunder." POV remains tightly controlled in close third, with perceptual signature evident in how he reads the landscape as both map and memory. Rhythm modulates effectively, stretching with the music box's "spring unwinding like a life."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("between sigh and smile" as temporal anchor). Some register elevation in peak moments ("arterial red," "iambs") fits the heightened reality. Deducted for occasional drift into abstract philosophizing that weakens immediacy ("alarming serenity that made every citizen taste their own pulse").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("ink-stained fingers," "meteor hush," "equations of regret") that serves the calligrapher's urbane perspective. The narrative voice modulates effectively between contemplative observation and magical realism without head-hopping, though occasional elevated diction ("uncommonly serene," "ethical storytelling manifesto") slightly strains against the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the memorial's construction. Some filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "she felt," "she thought") dulls immediacy in middle passages. Voice maintains its esoteric register throughout, though lacks a fully distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("lost wax caster turned midnight archivist of breath") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature is strong, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("snowmelt ardor, technically gentle").

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic language ("air tastes of rust and wet stone," "sound equal parts crystal and rust"). Voice maintains lyric compression under pressure without losing clarity. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("ethereal grit," "transcendence through interpreted dreams") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon in non-pattern moments.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with Naram-bel's perceptual signature favoring mathematical and astronomical details.

The prose texture suits the scholarly protagonist and mystical subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature with phrases like "walls breathed, floors forgot their angles" and "juice running like forgotten rivers down her chin."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinctive voice merges botanical and linguistic registers naturally ("night-blooming clematis unfurled," "suspended in a crystal paragraph"). The perceptual signature—Elara experiencing language as physical space and emotion as flora—remains consistent under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm accelerates during the rescue sequence while maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature with lyric compression ("fog thick enough to chew," "dreams bleeding green"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance.

The truncated final sentence ("trying to remember how to be") works as purposeful elision matching the dissolution theme.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature with Elara's archivist lens coloring observations ("habitually dating a page that the tower would never let her complete").

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("soft as hammered repose"). The perceptual signature focuses on texture and vibration fitting the sound-based world.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled diction ("petrichor," "chronological cruelty") appropriate to the archivist's scholarly perspective. Syntax varies effectively, particularly in longer periodic sentences that mirror the accumulative structure. However, register occasionally drifts toward purple prose ("time itself wanted to apologize") without clear POV justification, and some constructions feel artificially literary.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("flint striking memory," "a fuse counting up instead of down") and consistent perceptual signature focused on fire/light imagery.

    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Nilo experiences the world through sound levels, crystal formations, and cable vibrations. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: elongated during the terrace drift, compressed during the confession. The "vaulting hush" controls diction choices like "kissing stone" and maintains coherent distance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate narrative modesty, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the lore keeper notices everything with equal clarity rather than filtering through professional bias. Voice remains competent but generic, missing the texture that would distinguish this particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third-person POV with evocative perceptual signature ("frozen tears," "whisper of a boy"). The voice maintains gothic atmosphere while avoiding purple prose excess.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("sepia silhouettes," "eloquently silent") maintains atmospheric consistency. Some register elevation feels forced ("bridge of intuition between fallen kings") and occasional overwriting clouds clarity. The POV remains stable, though filter-heavy constructions ("Arin sensed," "Arin detected") accumulate in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice maintains lyric precision throughout—"Reality shifted" as structural refrain, selective perception ("thrum of unseen fruit"), and controlled psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice mixing technical precision ("adjusted the azimuth") with poetic perception ("auric cylinder"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains against the seventeen-year-old protagonist's lexicon ("coded freedom ringing off the hook").

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through musical consciousness ("intervals of fear and wonder," "diminished chord that tasted of copper"). The lyric voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic material while modulating effectively under pressure (shorter, more urgent phrasing during the prophecy's push).

No head-hopping occurs, and the purposeful elevated register serves the folkloric tone throughout without breaking character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice combines Victorian technical precision with lyrical flights ("time slacken; the tick he carried in his bones slowed"). The perceptual signature—a tinkerer who notices mechanisms, patterns, and temporal anomalies—remains consistent. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("exhaling cold mist," "ladder of mercury") enriches rather than disrupts the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature with alchemical/mystical coloring ("luminous regret," "factually mystical"). Consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("kintsugi intentions") fits the alchemist character but occasionally strains naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice through selective perception—Elara experiences the gorge as "a throat of stone" and confessions as "pale ribbons," establishing her synesthetic relationship to souls. The prose modulates effectively from lyrical opening to tense pursuit ("flickered away") to transcendent resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("misaligned counterweight," "ratchet," "mainspring barrel") with lyrical observation ("motes that drifted like slow confetti"). Perceptual signature strong—Mara reads everything as schematics. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through printing metaphors—hearts as "cracked chase," frost as "syllables of the world's true grammar," the orrery warping into "a question mark."

The prose rhythm accelerates through shorter fragments as reality destabilizes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive baroque register with controlled elevation: "gilded coffin," "corrode," "molten pewter." The perceptual signature maintains Aurelio's poet-revolutionary lens consistently. Dialogue between Aurelio and Mira carries philosophical weight naturally through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with musical metaphors throughout ("clinking softly like distant bells," "tinkersong wonder"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("covenant of rust," "unvarnished self as lubricant"). Perceptual signature strong in how Elias hears/perceives through sound.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on light, shadow, and botanical imagery. Strong perceptual signature in how Liora notices "frost settle on her eyelashes" and sees branches as cathedral window leading.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled register mixing archival precision ("two cables above," "isolation protocol") with lyrical compression ("dune-sheet parted like a sigh"). POV remains stable with Mireya's perceptual signature as archivist filtering observations. Some elevated diction ("searing reverie") occasionally drifts from established voice, and the final paragraph's rhythm could vary more under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains literary density with controlled metaphor ("glowing jellyfish," "lungs" for plazas) and consistent psychic distance through Veyra's perception. Some passages edge toward overwriting ("distillate of human longing") but rhythm generally supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through specialized attention (consecrated tweezers, xylem absorption, microscopic grooves) and rhythmic control sustains lyric pressure. Some register elevation in peak moments ("soft velvet disquiet") slightly exceeds the established voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("starlight fracture across the dome like a promise breaking") and consistent third-person limited POV. The perceptual signature shows a seed-saver's attention to texture, time, and growth cycles. Some passages achieve excellent rhythm under pressure ("She felt furiously tranquil, heart hammering yet breath steady"). Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV plausibility ("chitin and endosperm") and abstract conceptual framing around "borrowed time."

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's technical attention ("frequency 72 hertz, duration nine seconds") mixed with poetic observation ("clouds surged like slow whales").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sun-cracked frames," "mute eloquence") that maintains consistency. Some filter-verb clusters in observation sections ("Alden watched," "noticed," "understood") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how the poet notices fracture and incompleteness ("seam pulled loose," "chord so tense it trembled") with controlled lyric compression that serves the accumulative mode. The woman's minimal dialogue and the poet's spoken lines ("Morning is a torn net that still holds fish") carry poetic weight without feeling precious. Minor wobble in register during "cognitive smoothness" of philosophical articulation but recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice maintains a botanical precision ("mycorrhiza," "basaltic fissures") that reflects Mateo's systematic nature while modulating into lyric registers ("moon silvered the stone").

    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("moon-moth wings," "submerged concord"). Perceptual signature clear in how the coachman reads bird calls and translates languages. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established voice ("metabolize gunpowder").

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through Scraps' synesthetic translations ("each pop of static smelled of ozone"). Prose modulates from lyrical density in revelation moments to spare clarity during action. The rhythmic control in "Scraps limping slightly ahead, no longer a bloodhound retired from finding bodies but a courier teaching distance how to kneel" demonstrates mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elegiac register with selective perception ("each photon arriving like a letter delivered decades late") that reflects Kael's isolation. Some elevated diction ("blessed pariah," "temporally stretched") occasionally strains against the intimate grief narrative, and a few filter constructions ("Kael understood then") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled compression ("sky's colors bleeding like bruised glass"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—Vespers notices shadows, secrets, inverted physics. The prose teaches its pattern early and maintains coherence through peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice combines formal register with embodied specificity ("heel-toe-pause-toe-heel"). Perceptual signature shows in how Mara reads space as text and movement as archive. Minor compression in Kestrel's dialogue transition from threat to vulnerability could be smoother.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a distinctive mythic register with controlled imagery ("mercury-glass seer," "after-images of every reader"), though some passages drift into elevated abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature with chess-mind filtering reality ("fierce repose of tournament halls"), and the voice maintains consistency through emotional shifts.

    Distinctive voice with poetic compression and selective perception (spire as "needle stitching sky to stone"). POV control maintains Lira's interiority consistently. Some effective rhythm variation under pressure. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against character voice ("the forged hush between sounds grew heavier than any sentence") and some filter-verb clustering.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice through technical vocabulary ("specimen tray," "copper stylus") and rhythm control ("Chain two snapped. The workshop listed"). The refrain "between breaths held underwater" creates effective patterning though occasional register elevation ("liturgy," "tectonic teeth") slightly strains the alchemist POV.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with selective perception ("intimately aloof from the man who once believed") and consistent psychic distance. Some elevated diction fits the artistic POV but occasionally drifts toward writerly rather than lived ("the perfume of departure"). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor syntactic monotony in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency through compound imagery ("dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound") and synesthetic perception ("scent rising like a ghost"). The perceptual signature—hypersensitivity to vibrations, frequencies, and molecular communication—stays character-specific throughout. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer accumulative sentences and shorter declarative moments of realization.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("azimuth," "relay board") with lyrical compression ("moon was a clipped coin").

No head-hopping, controlled distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice combines rationalist precision with lyrical compression ("roots clung to the cliff like a man gripping a ledge with torn fingernails"), maintaining consistency through emotional intensification. The controlled rhythm and selective perception (focusing on spores, soil, storms) create a strong perceptual signature, though occasional phrases edge toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in how Maris reads gaps and absences professionally. Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation ("First gap: no gulls cried") to lyrical perception ("tiny rafts that carried alpine sun").

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent melancholic lyricism ("tracing coastlines that no longer existed") with controlled psychic distance. The prose modulates effectively during the mystical cavern sequence. Strong perceptual signature in details like "beer cans like metallic flowers."

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with scientific-romantic tension reflected in syntax—technical terms alongside poetic imagery. Clean POV control throughout. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially Mira's "By returning differently" which both repeats and enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice combining lyric elevation ("lungs full of cedar smoke") with philosophical precision ("chronologically confused"). Clean focalization maintains the chronicler's disoriented but articulate perspective. Slight register elevation in places ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") that occasionally distances from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-gothic register with musical metaphors threading throughout ("skipped record," "fixer finally takes," "slow applause"). Mirage's perceptual signature filters everything through performance and publication metaphors befitting her gossip-columnist identity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in how Mara reads probability into everything ("each drop felt weighted, like dice mid-roll"). Voice maintains consistency through compression and expansion. Some register elevation in descriptive passages doesn't quite match Mara's analytical baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("melodically haunted ring that climbed the tunnel walls like damp ivy"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some passages edge toward elevated register ("cultivated estrangement the way gardeners cultivate orchids") but maintain coherence through the narrator's isolation-as-craft mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("sky forgets its own colors") and consistent perceptual signature focused on texture and decay. The dialogue between archivist and guard carries effective subtext. Some register elevation ("haunted euphoria," "proximate causes") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, and the syntactic patterns could vary more under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice with "breaker of supply chains and hearts" and "polite as anarchy ever gets." The whimsical register holds consistently through "the moon, overhead and complicit, thinned to a grin."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity ("joyful sorrow looping endlessly"). The perceptual signature is strong - Elara notices gaps, absences, and spaces between sounds in a character-specific way that serves the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but relies heavily on abstract exposition ("her analytically intuitive mind," "volcanic tenderness of understanding") rather than embodied perception. Voice lacks distinctive texture, defaulting to elevated register ("corporeal," "repository") without character-specific idiom. The perceptual signature remains generic despite the pyromania premise.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through sound-focused observation and scientific-poetic register ("quantum foam," "auric lagoon"). Controlled psychic distance that deepens appropriately during transformation. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in peak moments ("cathedral," "parishioner") that momentarily exceeds Mara's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mira's professional voice filters perception effectively ("trained ear identified the walk," "deliberately pitched low"), with some texture in technical observations. Dialogue carries subtext about trust and discovery without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature with the guardian's selective attention to light patterns and silence. Some elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "negative space between shutter-slats") occasionally drifts from the established register. No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the premise of enforced silence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in how Mara hears "unspoken words the way other people heard wind." Lyric compression serves the accumulative design, with purposeful elision taught early. Minor dialogue ("I knew you'd hear it") carries subtext effectively, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains a lyrical register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm in passages like "Wind carried the kelp back to sea, weaving it into the raft that now drifted empty." Some elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "choreography of cargo") fits the POV of someone finding poetry in mundane work. Minor deduction for occasional register drift into abstraction that doesn't fully match Lira's embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent blank affect through "the emotional void that passed for voice" and clinical narration style ("Item: hydration deprivation complete"). The crow speaking disrupts naturalism momentarily but recovers through the performer's matter-of-fact response. Dialogue between performer and officer stays compressed and metaphorical, fitting the remade hush context.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive lyrical voice maintains consistent register through inventive compounds ("cloud-shadow," "lantern-moth hush") and musical attention to sound ("None shall pass"/"None shall stay"). POV control is exemplary with no head-hopping, and the prose rhythm accelerates during transformation sequences while breathing during reflection. The perceptual signature—seeing law as revisable text and boundaries as grammar—is unique and sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled lyricism ("tiny cyclones that carried glass dust into the atmosphere"). POV remains stable with Milo, though brief omniscient glimpses of Rosa's thoughts create minor slippage. Strong perceptual signature in how Milo experiences the world through arrangement rather than color.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful repetition ("laboratory of lost sounds" → "laboratory of found voices").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on craft details and transformation. Some elevated diction ("liminal space," "acoustic dome") fits the otherworldly setting.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent literary density with controlled rhythm ("Each droplet that struck the glass above her sounded like a coin falling into an empty wallet"). The perceptual signature is distinctive—she measures atmospheric pressure as "cultural barometrics," sees cards as circuit diagrams. No dialogue to evaluate, but the single whispered line fits the ritualistic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with inventive phrases like "atoms of nostalgia" and "copper tears." Perceptual signature shows in how she reads the archive's intentions and sees "different versions of who she might have been."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent meditative register appropriate to ritual, with some lovely specific phrases ("tiny paintbrush dipped in moonlight").

    Distinct perceptual signature in "lullaby foxes" and spice-taste memories; rhythm modulates perfectly from staccato ("blood is the price") to flowing ("blossoms opened backward"), with zero head-hopping in the hybrid "we" closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.6)
    Perceptual signature shines: "moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold" filters world through maternal grief. Rhythmic control under pressure (short clauses during time’s flood) avoids ventriloquism. Zero head-hopping; "willingly perplexed" repetition taught as pattern. Slight register drift in "conceptual cost" near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "gravitationally lighter when happy" and "hull plates singing." Rhythmic control under pressure ("stitch the photographs into a sail, threading their edges") earns 9+ despite minimal dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines in texture-focused noticing ("obsidian grains," "amber light"), but volcanic glass heat description repeats "heat" conceptually across beats, slightly diluting pressure in high-stakes release sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice modulates under pressure: "Footsteps again, heavier" compresses syntax during Voss' arrival; Garnet’s perceptual signature ("bruised violet" sky, "moth-wing" footsteps) filters all description through sentinel precision without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "aurora shimmered like a borrowed dawn" filters physics through grief. Rhythmic control intensifies during rock placement ("smooth oval... golden ratio points"), with no head-hopping despite Mira’s memory presence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.6)
    Perceptual signature shines via photographic lexicon ("silver halide ghosts," "negative image") and stress-distorted time ("thunder rarefied the air"). Rhythmic control shifts from lyrical ("furiously tranquil precision") to fragmented urgency during the lightning strike, with no head-hopping despite reflective depth.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vela's perceptual signature shines in gear-hum rhythms and angle-based noticing, but "rawly" in Caelus's speech slightly flattens voice distinction. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the vocoder stutter, maintaining pressure under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.6)
    Lark’s lyrical compression ("tasting the bones, not the marrow") versus Marin’s pragmatic cadence ("Warden wants programs that photograph well") stays distinct under pressure. Prose rhythm varies from fragmented urgency ("Skin splits") to flowing collaboration ("voices braid, echo upward"), with "winged, collaborative" shadows showcasing controlled density.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines ("reluctant pigeons," "flickering compasses"), but "strategically creative fingers" briefly drifts from pianist's lexicon. Rhythmic control sustains pressure through the ascent, though minor register slips occur.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("empirically whimsical hush," "tasted of orchids and iron") reflects Calyx’s reality-checking lens. Rhythmic control intensifies under pressure: fragmented clauses during the dream-walk contrast with lyrical closure. Zero head-hopping; communal dream remains focalized through her embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature evident in bonsai-tutor’s rhythmically placid diction ("Grow slower; the tides...") and compression under stress ("words arrived late"). Voice modulates from fog-like syllables to steady "dripping water" instruction without head-hopping.
