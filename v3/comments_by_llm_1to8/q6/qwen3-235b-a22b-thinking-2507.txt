  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct scientific voice with controlled academic register appropriate to POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Aris notices "radio signatures," "incremental build-up," "microscopic layers." Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("profound humility kindle") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature of artist-as-observer with phrases like "luminous glass artistry" and "thin ice crystals adorned." Voice maintains consistency through trauma and investigation. Minor register elevation in places ("ephemeral script," "testament to her refusal") slightly above natural POV range.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with selective perception ("frost-laced," "crystalline air"). Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("rectifying emotional turbulence into pure, coherent frequencies"). The silent world constraint is handled well through mime and thermal observation, though technical passages occasionally drift toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with consistent undertaker's perspective coloring perception ("lowering coffins into indifferent earth"). Strong rhythmic control in long, accumulative sentences that mirror the water's pressure. Some register drift into elevated diction ("spectral jellyfish," "abyssal gloom") that strains against Silas's working-class profession, though the lyric mode partially justifies this.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the exile leader's perspective, with selective perception focused on community and tradition. Some effective rhythm variation in peak moments. Deduction for occasional register elevation that feels writerly rather than character-driven ("silver thread of sound").

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("pilgrim of sparks," "foggy lucidity"), though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("visceral recollection of dusty monastery floors"). The breathing sequence effectively modulates rhythm to match the transformation, but occasional register elevation ("latent energy," "resonant reconfiguration") slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "ink bleeding into ghostly smudges like smoke caught in amber" and controlled modulation as voice fragments during the disintegration sequence. POV remains stable with purposeful compression during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm that accelerates during action ("She counted the sequence: three ebony, two ivory, one ebony"). Free indirect style is clean throughout, and the perceptual signature focuses selectively on tactile and visual details relevant to Elara's mission. Minor repetition of "staggering grace" feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register with strong perceptual signature—Elara perceives through sound-color synesthesia and engineering metaphors. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between technical precision and lyric meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with controlled rhythm and distinct perceptual signature ("golden-hour portrait thief"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous disbelief settled over her") that strains against the character's established voice. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.9)
    Elias's theatrical narration ("Observe!" "Behold!") creates a distinct voice that maintains consistency throughout. The performative commentary on mundane tasks reveals character through action. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract exposition ("the core concept of renewal humming in his veins") that doesn't match his embodied, dramatic persona.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive voice in phrases like "skeletal metal shelves clawing" and character-specific perception of the cast's scribbles. Some register elevation in peak moments ("electric hum of reclaimed agency") that doesn't fully match the established voice. The seashell's whispered dialogue feels slightly artificial in its thematic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyric register appropriate to an oracle's perception, with controlled rhythm that modulates between the storm's violence and the cell's hush. Some filter verbs ("she knew," "she recalled") could be cut for immediacy, but the perceptual signature—focusing on silence's texture and shape—remains consistent. The voice holds through pressure without degrading into generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice lacks distinction, defaulting to purple prose ("liquid constellations," "sacred significance") that doesn't match a robot janitor's perspective. POV consistency holds, but the prose reads like creative writing exercise rather than genuine voice. Filter-heavy construction ("Unit 7 felt," "It realized") creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with Elara's perceptual signature evident in her attention to acoustic detail and light. However, several filter constructions ("she realized," "she watched") diminish immediacy, and the dialogue between musicians feels slightly generic for their artistic status.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyric control with purposeful compression and patterned imagery. Perceptual signature strong: Elara notices "withered vines," "moss-slick path," details filtered through decades of expertise. Some register elevation in "pervasive smell of slow decay" and "entropy" feels slightly outside her pragmatic lexicon, though the overall texture remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision filtered through personal investment ("ghostly solidity that grounded her theory"). The prose effectively modulates between technical description and emotional interiority. Some phrases feel overwrought ("bruised twilight sky," "dormant sails") without clear POV justification.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in descriptive passages ("lit only by the erratic dance of his kerosene lantern"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("drowned cathedral of sound") slightly dulls immediacy. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on musical and water-formed imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in technical-poetic fusion: "her mind a lattice designed to absorb contradictions without collapsing." Voice maintains consistency through complex syntax that mirrors Elara's analytical-emotional duality. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice carries full narrative weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Leo's perceptual signature as a "geologist's focus" shapes how he engages the valve wheel, with voice maintaining consistency through technical observation ("beaded valve wheel," "brass spokes"). The radio dialogue effectively carries subtext about guilt and confession, though some abstract formulations ("crushing lightness") slightly strain the established pragmatic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's loose grip on reality shapes the prose texture, particularly in "perceiving the shifting shadows not as mere absence of light, but as living things whispering forgotten histories." The voice maintains consistency through pressure, with purposeful compression during the collapse sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a music therapist, and the prose modulates appropriately during the eclipse. However, abstract phrases like "softly adaptive resilience" and "ordinary magic" create register drift that doesn't fully match the otherwise grounded narration. The limited dialogue feels natural but doesn't fully distinguish the speakers.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice emerges through precise technical vocabulary ("filament-thin manipulator," "harmonic echo") and the measured, archival tone befitting Elara's nature. The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation and moments of deeper resonance like "bronze quiet." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance appropriate to a non-human consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices technical details, light patterns, nautical dangers. Some elevated diction during crisis ("transpose this nightmare into hope") slightly strains the established voice. Dialogue minimal but Chen's cryptic speech is distinctive. Filter verb clusters in middle section ("she saw," "she knew") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with ecclesiastical diction meeting technical precision ("Boss RC-300," "geometric heart"). The perceptual signature of silence-as-substance is distinctive, though some phrases feel overwrought ("the pigment swallowing the faint echo of his breathing").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "upturned hush" and "liquid symmetry." The perceptual signature focuses on sound-sight synthesis fitting a synesthetic conductor. Minor register elevation in places ("chronologically homesick") that doesn't fully match the character's fortune-cookie-writer background.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic-lyric register appropriate to the concept, with strong perceptual signature in phrases like "gravity a suggestion he defied." The POV remains stable and controlled. However, some constructions strain ("the drop and the ripple stretching into an agony of hesitation"), and occasional filter-verb clusters ("He saw the moment") slightly dull immediacy during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "calloused fingers," feeling rather than hearing, vibration as primary sense. Prose rhythm accelerates during discovery ("The machine groaned, the needle scraping") then expands into revelation, with controlled technical precision about the phonograph mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("998 hPa, unusually low") and measured observation that reflects Elara's profession. The perceptual signature shows in how she notices details like "tarnished message tube" and "faint smudge of indigo dye." Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to intimate reflection ("true threat was systemic").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Silas's technical attention to light and scent. Controlled modulation from careful precision to emotional overwhelm. Strong free indirect style maintains consistency. Slight register elevation in places ("irreplaceable wholeness") creates minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains poetic texture through selective perception ("terra-cotta walls," "liquid starlight") and compressed syntax that mirrors Elara's artistic sensibility. The perceptual signature holds—a poet noticing patterns, textures, cadences—though some phrases like "ethically playful" feel slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through acoustic focus—"hearing the subtle decay in the drowned apple trees' roots." Rhythm modulates effectively from long, suffocating sentences during hush to shorter fragments during playing. Minor filter verb clustering ("She remembered," "she sensed") doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Lena's professional assessment mode ("top notes of shock, middle swell of despair"). Voice modulates effectively as emotional intensity rises. Some register elevation in peak moments ("emergent property," "inadvertently facilitated") slightly exceeds the established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voices—Aris's business calculation vs. Elena's quiet grief. Good perceptual signatures (cargo-trained eyes noting addresses, Elena's archival mindset). Dialogue carries subtext effectively. Deduction for some register elevation during emotional peaks ("cautious exuberance," "silent contributor") that doesn't fully match established voices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("their branches heavy with translucent fruit, cast prismatic shards"), though occasional filter phrases like "She realized" and "She understood then" slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature—focusing on light, weaving, and connection—remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with naturalist's precision ("ink-stained fingers," "spider silk") that maintains consistency through stress. Some elevated diction ("velvet sky," "labyrinth of elevated waterways") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally strains. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor register drift in phrases like "temporal fracture" that feel more academic than character-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's analytical yet emotionally attuned perspective, seeing emotions as mathematical patterns. Some elevated diction ("dovetail," "ambiguous loss") occasionally strains against the mystical-analytical voice. The controlled rhythm effectively modulates with discovery, though a few passages lean toward expository interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's custodial knowledge ("every groan of the aging building") and selective attention to infrastructure. Voice modulates with discovery, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("fragile, quiet light"). The POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, but occasional filter constructions dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through botanical terminology and Elara's tendency toward over-explanation ("circuitously sincere nature"). Voice modulates effectively from analytical observation to wonder during the transformation scene. Minor compression under emotional pressure ("Alright, show me your way") maintains consistency while reflecting state change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice through compound constructions and water-saturated diction matches Elara's artistic exhaustion. POV remains controlled with strong perceptual signature ("each hour a relentless tide"), though occasional register elevation ("convergence of enemy and victim") slightly exceeds the character's exhausted state.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled musicality matching the cave setting ("notes skipping, overlapping in dissonant clusters"). POV remains stable with Elara. Dialogue between Elara and pilgrim carries subtext and advances plot naturally, though occasionally edges toward explicating theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara processes objects through touch-triggered visions, with controlled psychic distance shifts during vision sequences. Some register elevation in phrases like "herald's trumpet valve, tarnished but intact" feels slightly formal for the intimate POV, and dialogue absence limits full voice assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through mapper's analytical eye ("intricate ink lines," "cataloging patterns"). Voice maintains consistency through technical observation shifting to emotional recognition. Some filter verb accumulation ("he noticed," "he saw") dulls immediacy in middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("bruised twilight sky," "memory-tide") that reflects Elara's educated background. Some moments edge toward elevated diction ("symphony wasn't unheard") but generally the POV holds steady. Psychic distance modulates effectively during the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("hushed thunder," "dimensional mutiny"). Some filter verb clusters ("he'd felt," "he saw") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections. Strong perceptual signature with immortal's long view of time.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to Elara's mathematical mindset. POV remains stable throughout. However, the dialogue between Elara and Reynolds feels stilted, and Reynolds' voice lacks distinction from the narration's register.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: "traced a trembling finger," "oppressive hush that pressed against her ears like cotton wool." Rhythm modulates with discovery—shorter phrases during charting, longer during temporal perception. No head-hopping, controlled psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("cracked mudflats," "metallic canyon") and consistent perceptual filtering through absence. Dialogue fragments feel authentically overheard and carry crucial plot information. Some register elevation in peak moments ("palimpsests of lives") slightly strains the established voice without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled elevated diction matching an academic protagonist ("myth buster of celestial hoaxes"). POV remains stable with clear focalization through Aris. The reconstructed dialogue through the cello maintains Elara's voice distinctly. Some filter verb clusters ("He felt the shell grow warmer") and occasional register elevation but rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close-third POV with Kael's perspective coloring descriptions ("perpetual carnival's heartbeat thrumming"). Some phrases edge toward writerly rather than lived ("gentrification wasn't a sudden storm; it was a slow seep"), but voice remains largely controlled and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent scientific precision with elegiac undertones, though some passages drift into elevated register ("celestial collisions," "gradient of sorrow"). The Chinese character "取出" appears jarringly mid-sentence. POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of a scientist-documentarian comes through, but lacks the distinctive texture of higher work.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through touch, sound, and electromagnetic sensation rather than sight. "Fractured wing...cool and sharp against her skin" establishes tactile primacy immediately. Voice maintains consistency through technical precision balanced with maternal warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elara's dry academic voice remains consistent with phrases like "such peace usually heralded disaster" and "trusted the data over the drama." However, several instances of register drift occur ("the sky weeps and the land remembers") that feel artificially elevated beyond her established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with consistent metaphorical register around vibration and resonance ("taut wire," "brittle pulse," "fractured foundations"). The prose maintains lyric control without head-hopping. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("syncopated beat of daily existence") that slightly exceeds the established voice's range.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third-person with strong perceptual signature ("salt air burned his lungs"). Rhythm accelerates during crisis and slows appropriately during recovery. Some elevated diction ("lonesome splendor") occasionally strains against the military POV.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("the suffocating echo of a voice dismissed"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization. However, some passages drift into elevated diction that strains against the boy's perspective ("sustained the impossibility of his innocence"), and the magical element lacks voice-grounded preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct narrative texture with controlled lyricism: "a flicker at the edge of the citrus grove, her form woven from ash and starlight." The ghost's dialogue is appropriately ethereal yet purposeful. Minor register elevation in places ("mournful elation in her eyes") but largely consistent with the greenhouse-keeper's perspective. Free indirect style handles the ghost's explanation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("tide pools emptying like spent tears") and controlled rhythm that mirrors the weaving action. The perceptual signature shows in selective attention to texture and thread. Some elevated diction ("hauntingly optimistic") occasionally strains the register, but the voice maintains coherent texture through emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in how Elara notices "patterns etched by time" and reads the orchard's "embrace of death." Voice modulates effectively from meditative observation to the crisp "soft, final click." Dialogue carries authentic subtext when Kael reveals generational knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Silas's reverent attention to tactile details and analog rituals. Lyric compression works well ("ghostly warmth of solarium glass"). Some register elevation in abstract moments ("futuristic nostalgia," "surveillance-saturated metropolis") slightly tensions the intimate POV but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent free indirect style with selective perception ("weak autumn sun," "cobalt observatory") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the transmission sequence. Some filter phrases ("she forced herself") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature with selective noticing ("roots snagging her cloak" during urgency). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression without losing clarity. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("terrifying freedom of the choice before the choice") slightly strains the established voice but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism - "watercolors of indigo and pearl," "fossilized puzzle." POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("lotus-hearted ache") that slightly exceeds the established range.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm that matches Elara's artistic sensibility ("fog pressed close, thick and silent, swallowing the weak afternoon light"). The perceptual signature shows an artist's eye for color and light throughout. Minor slips include occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match stressed moments ("pensive mirth filled her chest") and some filter-verb clustering in the middle third that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm, especially in the awakening sequences. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("bewitching the garden through reflected sound"), but the perceptual signature remains consistent. The prose modulates effectively with the escalating wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct academic voice with controlled vocabulary ("entomologist," "recalibrate," "resonant vibrations") fits the scholar protagonist. Dialogue between Aris and Elara advances plot efficiently while maintaining subtext about urgency. Some register elevation in peak moments ("converging chaos," "silent jammer") serves the concept, though occasional exposition-heavy passages slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and patterned metaphorical language ("tidepool reflecting fractured starlight," "grief's acid into verse"). POV remains stable without head-hopping, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("blood-orange moon clawed the horizon") that slightly strain the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, elegiac register appropriate to the contemplative protagonist, with selective perception focused on sound and light ("liquid gold," "sapphire"). Perceptual signature is consistent in noticing resonance and decay. Slight deduction for occasional elevated diction ("deserted marvels," "foxglove regret") that, while beautiful, occasionally feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's scholarly POV, with selective perception focused on linguistic details. Some register drift into overly ornate phrasing ("time's relentless tide") that occasionally distances from immediacy. The perceptual signature around color-coded ink reactions is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with distinct perceptual signature ("calculating water pressure tolerances against structural decay"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("dappled resolve," "slyly heartfelt audacity") that slightly strains the machinist's practical lexicon, though the rhythm effectively modulates with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third POV with distinct perceptual signature in how Elara traces dust motes and counts paths. Some register drift into elevated diction ("elegant copperplate forgery," "chaotic paths") that occasionally exceeds character lexicon. Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, particularly in the release moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive phrasings like "featherly determined" and selective perception focused on patterns and codes. POV control is solid throughout, filtering the fantastical world through Elara's maze-architect perspective. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("fractured hush," "drifting prism terrace"), and the lack of dialogue means we miss potential voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through compound imagery ("shadowseam wonder," "liquid stars") and scientific-poetic register fitting a landscape astrologer. Perceptual signature strong: Elara reads constellations in bioluminescence. Minor register elevation in peak moments ("fierce, cleansing fires") slightly exceeds POV baseline but doesn't break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with phrases like "sea-foam recollectionist" and "cheerful gloom," and the perceptual signature focuses appropriately on color and texture. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("transliterating emotions into visible light") beyond what the intimate POV warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with Elara's analytical lens coloring descriptions like "calculated wilderness" and "orchestrating serendipity." The prose rhythm accelerates with the rising tide effectively. Minor filter verb clustering ("She noted," "Elara watched") slightly dulls immediacy in observational passages.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression: "Her exile was elective, a necessary flight from a world that criminalized memory." The perceptual signature focuses on gaps and absences consistently. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("epidermis," "infinitely reflective") that doesn't fully match Elara's embodied perspective during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's glazier lens—"reading between the lines of cracked glass" and seeing "stress fractures, hidden flaws." The prose modulates effectively from contemplative observation to crystallized understanding, though occasional register elevation ("noctilucent reckonings") slightly strains the working-class POV's natural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("slow dance of celestial bodies"). POV remains stable with appropriate interiority for Kai's reflective state. Some elevated diction ("visceral truth of a father's broken promise") occasionally strains against the character's voice but serves the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register with phrases like "fractal patterns," "tentative equations," and "serene upheaval." POV remains stable with Elara's logical-dreamer perspective filtering all perception. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("cathedral of possibility") that slightly strains the established voice, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("She'd brought it to measure").

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's synesthetic ability to hear stone whispers and feel vibrations. Prose modulates with discovery beats, particularly when handling the artifacts. Some register drift into elevated diction ("crystallized in silver halide") and occasional filter verb clusters dilute immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"fleeting rainbows that danced across the worn flagstones." The perceptual signature focuses on light, moisture, and resonance fitting the painter's art. Some elevated diction ("perceptively calm grace") occasionally strains but remains largely coherent with the ethereal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's ritualistic attention and professional framing ("forever war peace negotiator"). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and goal-pursuit. Deduction for some register elevation in stress moments ("the slow dance of celestial bodies," "ash in her mouth") and filter-heavy passages that occasionally distance rather than immerse.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—Thorne notices through the lens of ownership and loss (his dams, his surveys, his memory). The controlled distance and formal diction ("bespoke boots," "manufactured drought") fits the character, though Lena's dialogue could carry more subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Elara's poetic sensibility—threads become "stanzas," movement becomes "sonnet," the courtyard reads as "tableau." Voice maintains lyric elevation consistently without drift. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("crystalline silence") that slightly exceeds the established range, though it serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong POV consistency with distinctive voice ("meteor hush," "blood on the page") and controlled psychic distance. Some register elevation in peak moments ("uncommonly serene calm") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism—"churning sea of clouds," "fallen constellations"—that maintains consistency without overwhelming. Some elevated diction ("transiently rooted," "verdant") occasionally strains but serves the contemplative tone. The perceptual signature of noticing minute details fits the character's esoteric realist nature.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice through technical precision ("technically gentle," "calibrated by decades") and craft-specific perception. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("snowmelt ardor," "cathedral of ice") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally drifts toward purple. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature of a craftsperson noticing through touch and material properties is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("vine-draped bunker shuddering") and consistent POV handling Elara's temporal condition. Perceptual signature strong in moments like "ethereal grit of damp earth and ozone." Some register elevation in closure ("testament to how paths grew sentient") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent erudition matching Kael's scholarly perspective, with selective perception focused on astronomical and mathematical details. Phrases like "skeletal grandeur" and "dusky harmony" create distinct texture. However, some elevated diction ("covenant oath in Akkadian") feels performative rather than organic, and the lack of dialogue prevents full demonstration of voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on tactile details and body states. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("It's broken" / "The melody lives in us"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("shifting grace," "cellular memory") slightly exceeds the established lexicon. Free indirect style clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature - "each exhaled breath a ghostly plume" - though occasional overwriting ("forgotten breath," "glass mountains") slightly dulls precision. Silas's dialogue effectively contrasts Elara's technical mindset with organic wisdom, but some filter constructions reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with character-specific perception ("her one clear quartz eye scanning"). Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Mom... I understand now"). Some filter phrases like "Elara knew better" slightly distance immediacy but serve characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent academic-explorer register with effective modulation ("the absurdity struck him"). Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("velvet void," "regolith") but remain within character. The philosophical breakthrough section risks register drift but recovers through specificity. Minor filter verb accumulation ("He felt," "He saw") dulls immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains arcane linguist register with "temporal weave," "chronos-ferns," and "Root Tongue" fitting Elara's expertise. Dialogue between Elara and Kael feels functional but lacks subtext—his skepticism and her certainty play as positions rather than character. The narrative stance holds steady through urgency, though diction occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("reality's fabric").

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shows in phrases like "skeletal Ferris wheel clawing at the gray like a dying starfish." Voice maintains consistency through lyric compression and maintains POV modesty—Lyra perceives only what she can access. Syntax mirrors her "blissfully aberrant" nature through unconventional constructions that remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive academic voice with controlled syntax ("warmly methodical nature guiding her precise movements"). Perceptual signature clear in how Elara notices archival details and physical textures. Minor register elevation in places ("fractured nations") but maintains consistency through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("ripple-marks," "deep-time silence"). However, some elevated diction ("jagged, dissonant shriek," "profound, hammered repose") occasionally drifts from Elara's established register, and repetitive sentence structures in the middle section reduce rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"shard of hush," "vacuum of calm." POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature strong in how Elara notices astronomical precision and historical echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy setting with distinct perceptual signature ("summer-quill," "stormlit," "cloud-sea"). Prose rhythm modulates effectively between longer descriptive passages and shorter, more urgent moments of memory reception. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor register elevation in places ("the very essence she was sworn to preserve") but generally controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice through the chant rhythm and selective perception ("tremor in a moth's wing"). POV remains stable with clear focalization. Some elevated diction ("gravity of hopelessness," "suffocating void") slightly strains against otherwise grounded narration.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature shown through chronicler's lens - reading stone "like braille," seeing time in water droplets. Voice modulates from contemplative to revelatory without losing coherence. Slight register elevation in philosophical passages ("texture of time itself") doesn't fully violate POV lexicon but creates minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm, though register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's child-perspective ("intangibly tangible as breath against glass"). The perceptual signature of cataloging flavors and textures stays distinct, but some passages drift toward writerly display.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("fluidly logical" movements, technical acoustic awareness). Diction fits the elevated setting while remaining accessible. Some phrases feel overwrought ("vaulting hush pressing against crystal facets"), but rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly during the humming sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "fractured light painting the hidden orchard in liquid sapphire and emerald hues." POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the fantasy-adventure register ("transient gold," "sigmoid soul").

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward overwriting ("suffocating despair that made the air itself feel heavy").

Some repetitive phrasing appears ("burned bridges carefully" twice), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with phrases like "sapphire and emerald shadows" and "fractured starlight." Some register drift into abstract territory ("the quantum promise – the siren song") doesn't fully match Elara's practical survivor perspective. The glitching texts create effective voice variation though their fragmented warnings feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception - "fingers leaving faint trails in the dust," "the hour in the first yawn of evening." The POV maintains consistent psychic distance and filters everything through Elara's scholarly, intuitive consciousness. Minor repetition of "golden shadows" slightly weakens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third with selective perception ("weak afternoon light," "sterile silence"), though some phrases drift toward elevated register ("forgotten constellations," "sacred thing"). The perceptual signature of an archivist noticing dust patterns and document details is maintained, but occasional overwriting dilutes voice specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains consistent control with effective modulation - from methodical observation to urgent action to the lyrical "liquid starlight" passages. The perceptual signature of noticing patterns in dust and puddle reflections fits Kael's careful observer nature. Some phrases like "carefully resourceful" and "revised histories" feel more like authorial labels than organic POV language.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm that mirrors the story's musical subject ("a low, breathy A—not to add sound, but to define the space around it").

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature shows in selective botanical attention ("maple samara, birch catkin") and the specific joy in ordering. Voice maintains lyric consistency through "mossy delight" as textural anchor. Some register elevation in climactic passages ("the veil thinned and the land's true voice") slightly exceeds established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with Aris seeing through a tinkerer's lens—"fingers smudged with oil and soot," "mapping each fracture with calipers." The prose modulates well between technical precision and lyrical release at the waterfall. Some filter verb clustering ("Aris felt," "He felt") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice modulates between technical precision ("ceramic spoon over blue bunsen flame") and emotional depth, though some passages drift toward overwriting. The perceptual signature stays consistent but occasionally reaches for elevated register ("luminous, aching space") that strains the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("bruised gold and lavender," "luminous ache"). POV remains stable with Elara's perception filtering the supernatural elements consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting. Perceptual signature evident in how Elara experiences through the lens of memory and intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision befitting an elevator technician's observational skills, with specialized vocabulary (horologist, mainspring barrel) grounding authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled elevated diction matching Elara's poetic nature ("baroque silence," "gilded ruins"). Some register drift into overly ornate phrasing ("burnished sorrow" appears twice) that occasionally obscures immediacy. Varek's dialogue effectively contrasts with narrative voice, carrying subtext about ideological rigidity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-technical register with controlled vocabulary ("tinkersong wonder," "harmonic truth").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with "sensibly eccentric" voice and scientific precision yielding to wonder. Effective modulation as emotional intensity rises ("Tears cut clean tracks"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("locus where data gave way to awe") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mara's perceptual signature as a sculptor shapes what she notices—wood grain, carved forms, ocean patterns—though some passages drift into elevated register ("timewoven alliances binding land and water"). The turbine-hum reverie creates rhythmic control, but occasional template cadence ("She saw... Then came...") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical touches ("winter's last snow surrendered to spring's hesitant breath"). Some register elevation in emotional peaks feels slightly forced ("umbral tenderness"). The POV maintains consistency with artist's perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction matching the archivist protagonist. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices archival details and historical resonances. Some register elevation in phrases like "retrocognitively trapped sorrow" but it fits the character's scholarly nature.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("salt-bleached pier," "fossilized tears") and purposeful compression in the working memory sequence. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("ghost town lay silent, its wooden buildings leaning like weary bones") that slightly exceeds the alchemist's established lexicon during non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's archival lens and dead language fluency. Some elevated diction ("velvet disquiet," "cathedral of forgotten sounds") fits the mythic register but occasionally distances.

    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("frost feathers blooming," "cathedral of frozen silence"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative certainty. The prose modulates effectively with pressure, tightening during the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature focused on subtle atmospheric details. Voice modulates appropriately with internal tension ("The switch beneath her thumb felt alien suddenly"). Some filter verb clusters ("she felt," "she knew," "she recalled") slightly dull immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("star-dust," not dust; "cosmic janitor") that reflects Silas's spiritual curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric distance with selective perception ("tranquilly perceptive recluse") and controlled rhythm. The perceptual signature shows in how Silas reads the box's fractures as narrative. However, some register drift appears ("mute eloquence," "contextual clues") that feels writerly rather than character-driven, and internal thought occasionally explains what's been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The perceptual signature of someone who "feels time's texture" manifests in selective attention to resonance and material traces—indigo symbols, humming frequencies, mineral-encoded sorrow. Voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("anticipated mysteries coiled in the air") that slightly exceeds the established POV lexicon, and dialogue absence prevents full voice distinction testing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "burnished hush" creating distinct texture. The perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices "raindrops clung to reeds like liquid pearls."

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent botanical precision ("delicate lattice," "copper trajectories") fitting an island caretaker's expertise. The perceptual signature shows in how Aris reads the pillars' groans as communication and tracks stress points.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains scientific precision filtered through rebellious passion ("luminous skeptic," "chemistry of homecoming").

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception focused on ecological details and death/life contrasts fitting Elias's coachman-healer perspective. The prose modulates between contemplative observation and active ritual work, with bird dialogue naturalistically integrated through the dead language conceit. Some passages edge toward elevated diction ("narrow vastness," "fragile victory") that occasionally strains against the character's working-class origins.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.7)
    The bloodhound POV shapes every perception—scents carry narrative weight ("sharp tang of oxidized copper meant danger"), and Silas's tracking mind "shifting from scent to sight" feels authentic. The prose modulates from descriptive calm to urgent discovery ("His heart hammered against his ribs"). Some moments edge toward elevated diction ("the wild hush cradling him") but remain mostly grounded in Silas's sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Elara's isolation, with phrases like "echoed silence pressing against her eardrums like submerged water."

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent fantasy-tinged register with controlled diction ("frost-bitten brass," "inverted hue"). POV remains stable in close third, tracking Silas's perceptions of wrongness through the sundial and his physical sensations.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistency through selective perception focused on body language and architectural details. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.

Some elevated diction ("constellation of textures") occasionally strains but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature through chess-tutor lens ("trained to spot patterns in chaos") and distinctive syntax in peak moments. Some register elevation in middle passages ("chronomancy," "benediction") slightly strains the established voice without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and effective modulation during confrontation, though occasional register drift ("suffocating narrative that denied the canyon's living breath") doesn't fully match Kael's artist-rebel perspective. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and advances conflict efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception under stress and appropriate diction. The shift to the statue's voice ("We carved you from the mountain's heart") is handled cleanly. Some filter verb accumulation ("she realized," "she needed," "she'd been told") dulls immediacy in places, and occasional register elevation ("defiant narration of memory against the silence of dissolution") doesn't fully match Elara's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Elara's artist's eye ("cerulean paint," "miniature constellations") and selective attention to color/light.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with controlled diction and strong perceptual signature (Aris notices mechanical details, bronze patina, technical solutions). The mysterious caller's voice is effectively differentiated. Some register drift into elevated literary phrasing ("moonlight bled," "yawning chasm") that doesn't fully match Aris's technical mindset during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains consistent medical-academic register appropriate to Elara's rationalist perspective, though it occasionally veers toward overwriting ("perpetual damp," "storm-scoured cliffs"). The free indirect style works well, particularly in tracking her shifting perception as the glass eye takes effect. Some sentences strain under their conceptual weight, particularly the exposition-heavy middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("nautical twilight," "opal dock") and consistent POV. Good perceptual signature in how Silas notices maritime details versus alpine memories.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong POV control with distinctive perception ("empirically intuitive") and consistent focalization through Elias. Rich syntax variation and rhythm control, especially in the discovery sequence.

    Strong perceptual signature with selective details like "boots scuffing the obsidian shale" and "star-scented air." Voice maintains consistency through lyrical descriptions while modulating appropriately during the climactic command sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice blends scientific precision ("logarithmic curve," "columella curl") with poetic observation ("twilight bleeding into volcanic caldera").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the dream chronicler's analytical yet poetic voice ("chaos had bled into waking life"). Psychic distance modulates effectively between close interiority and dream-state expansion. Minor register elevation in places ("temporal disarray," "suffocating fog") but largely consistent with character's writerly perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's focus on absence and tactile detail ("traced the brass rim"). Some filter-heavy passages ("She'd learned this weeks ago") create distance, but voice maintains consistency through the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, literary diction appropriate to a rune scholar, and perceptual signature shows in how Kael notices magical/textural details. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the fragile lull where the last thunder faded and the next had not yet gathered") that doesn't fully match the character's stressed state. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice blends journalistic precision ("ink-stained fingers now stained with something older") with lyrical compression. Dialogue between Elara and Silas maintains subtext—his "You cut me down before the harvest" carrying both literal and metaphorical weight. Some filter verb accumulation ("she muttered," "she whispered") slightly dulls immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains an elevated register appropriate to the cosmic scope with controlled rhythm in phrases like "resounding hush so profound it vibrated in the bones." The dictionary definitions show distinct texture—"void" and "time" rendered in paradoxical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in how Aris experiences the horizon and hydraulic systems. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "infinitesimal edges slicing through existence itself" that feel elevated beyond the established voice. The countdown provides strong rhythmic control, though internal observations occasionally slip into overly articulate territory.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.3)
    The POV maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond spatial awareness. Dialogue ("Stop," "You're the physicist from the conference," "Show me") serves plot mechanics without subtext or character-specific rhythm. The narrative voice defaults to explanatory mode ("She had let go and gained everything") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct academic voice with controlled shifts during emotional peaks. Dialogue between Elara and the old woman carries strong subtext. Some register elevation ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradiction") occasionally strains but mostly serves the literary tone.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric compression with controlled rhythm ("His shift began between the hum of streetlamps").

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and selective perception (walnut ink as "earth-born constellations"), though occasionally drifts into elevated diction that strains POV credibility ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant"). Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Your grandmothers stood here"). Deduction for register inconsistency in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Aris's jocular deflections and specific noticing (cracked spectacles, ivy rustle). Some register drift into elevated diction ("polite anarchy," "improbable rumor chains") that occasionally feels authorial rather than character-driven. Dialogue effectively carries subtext when present.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature through ultrasonic absorption and tactile navigation maintains consistency, with syntax appropriately fragmenting under pressure ("She froze.

Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("She understood now") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Elara's profession, with selective perception focused on gravitational phenomena and quantum mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's synesthetic translation of silence into imagined music. Controlled psychic distance maintains intimacy without head-hopping. Kael's sign language creates effective dialogue-equivalent with subtext. Some elevated diction ("phosphorescent," "cadence") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally drifts from character register.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, archaeological precision matching Elara's analytical nature, and perceptual signature shows in how she reads vandalism as code. However, syntactic variety is limited, with many sentences following similar subject-verb-object patterns, and emotional peaks don't modulate the prose rhythm sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains a distinct lyrical register with controlled rhythm that modulates with intensity—from measured opening to "frantic, joyful rhythm" to final stillness. The perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices through sound and vibration ("the universe inhaling," "rhythm only she and the dying stars understood"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal texture remains coherent even under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong perceptual signature with Silas's gait-reading ability coloring observations ("light and hesitant," "heavy boots of dockworkers"). Prose modulates effectively under pressure, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("colossal tuning forks," "knife cuts").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("a shadow among shadows," "liquid reflection and hushed breath").

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voice modulates from clinical observation ("cobalt-tinted windows swallowing mist") to urgent action ("moved like a shadow"). The girl's dialogue feels authentic in its fragmented fear.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara experiences water ("liquid emerald where sunlight pierced the depths").

No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive theatrical narration voice ("Behold, the humble blade") creates ironic distance from mandated emotion. POV maintains consistent blank affect with submerged interiority. Mrs. Gable's dialogue carries appropriate tension but could differentiate more from Elara's register.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm ("fragile as moth wings against glass") and distinctive perceptual signature focused on light, shadow, and resonance. However, abstract philosophical declarations ("The boundary is a wound") occasionally replace embodied perception, and some phrases feel over-elevated for moments of physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature through colorblind filtering and tactile focus. Some register elevation in phrases like "currency of bartered awakenings" and "the earth's voice" creates occasional distance from Lysander's embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct voice with specialized lexicon ("137.5 Hz," "prism-song bell ringer," "harmonic residues") that maintains consistency. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices sound as physical presence in dust and wire.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "calloused finger," "genuinely artificial perfection," and "fragile as moth wings." Some register drift occurs ("顽强 life" appears unexplained, likely an artifact). The POV remains stable in close third, though occasional phrases like "now felt like a mockery" could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with selective perception (exact measurements, card positions). Dialogue natural and goal-driven—Maya's raw "How do you find solid ground?" contrasts effectively with Elara's measured responses. Minor convergence in register during explanation sequences where both characters become slightly too articulate.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("dust-choked," "spectral shards"). Some register elevation in philosophical passages ("atoms of nostalgia," "fundamental particles") creates occasional distance. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with selective perception ("the quiet hum of the night insects amplifying the hollow ache"). Some elevated diction ("translucent skin," "fractured emeralds") fits the contemplative mood. Minor register drift in places ("ethically sourced specimens").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct medical-philosophical register with controlled modulation ("frantic buzz" to "meteor hush"). The plant telepathy creates an unusual perceptual signature, though some phrases ("displaced miracle," "closure seeker") feel concept-driven rather than voice-organic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, slightly elevated diction appropriate to a crystal gazer's perspective. Perceptual signature is distinct in how Elara processes psychic impressions spatially. Some passages drift toward abstraction ("living geometry of longing") without sufficient grounding, and psychic distance occasionally wavers during key revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical register appropriate to the moonstruck dreamer POV—"eyes perpetually reflecting the night sky's silvered glow." Perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences the aurora's pulse as "feelings—sorrow, longing, the choked gasps of stifled song." Some elevated diction ("shadowed rapture," "resonance building from the core outward") occasionally drifts from the established register but maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice combines technical language ("wave functions," "quantum repository") with poetic imagery ("fractured lullaby"), creating a consistent post-apocalyptic register. The perceptual signature—focusing on light, silence, and mechanical details—remains stable, though occasional phrases like "pixel by fragile pixel" feel slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("groaning pistons," "whirring canopy"). Some moments drift toward elevated diction not fully grounded in Elara's philosopher-wanderer lexicon ("resonant thrumming that vibrated in her molars"). The prose texture is distinct with controlled rhythm, though occasional filter phrases appear ("She saw how," "Elara understood").

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.6)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency with phrases like "shoreline lullaby" and "gently persistent," though sometimes reaches for elevated diction ("traversed the veiled ridgeway") that feels slightly performative. The ferry guides' dialogue ("This marks you as one who seeks") carries appropriate weight but lacks distinctive character voices. POV control remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "cobalt purgatory" and "frostbitten hope," creating a distinct melancholic register. However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("the fortress's terrible arithmetic," "seraphically mundane endurance") that shift into philosophical mode rather than maintaining Elara's embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited with clean focalization through Aris. Strong perceptual signature in how he "traces the spines of knowledge as if blessing each volume." Some elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "sanctum") fits the fantasy register though occasionally feels performed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains scientific precision mixed with elegiac tone, with distinctive perceptual signatures like the tapping rhythm that grounds Aris. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("horizon bled into a bruised twilight") but largely maintain control.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression—"bruised purples and hesitant golds," "thunderous serenity." The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering everything through Elara's mix of technical observation and mystical sensitivity. Some register elevation in phrases like "tectonic pulse" and "resonant reconfiguration" occasionally strains against the established voice, particularly given the threadbare jumpsuit context.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through plant-telepathy shapes how Elara experiences the world ("whispers forming like blooming flowers"). Voice modulates appropriately from contemplative to urgent during the unsealing. Some filter verb clusters ("she saw," "she felt") and occasional register drift into abstract conceptual language reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how trauma filters sensory input (gull cry becomes drone whine). Controlled modulation from lyric description to visceral panic to grounded resolution. Minor filter verb clusters ("feeling," "catching") slightly dull immediacy in the grounding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "salt-laced wind seeping through cracked panes as if the very walls were closing in." The rhetorical questions feel natural to an artist's crisis. Slight register elevation in places ("luminescent ache") but mostly maintains consistency. The perceptual signature of noticing light, color, and texture marks this as unmistakably an artist's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled scientific precision ("ultra-high definition," "neural overdrive") that fits the tracker-researcher. Some register elevation in emotional beats feels slightly forced ("glacier calving," "stone in her gut"). The perceptual signature is clear but occasionally drifts toward overwrought metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate register for Elara's position, though lacks distinctive perceptual signature. Some phrases feel templated ("hands trembled," "heart hammering") rather than character-specific. Dialogue from enforcers is functional and brief, serving its purpose without distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature in noticing "minute shift in a leaf's angle" and "almost imperceptible tremor." Voice maintains consistency through elevated but controlled diction matching Elara's contemplative nature. Slight overwriting in places ("grim monument to the world that ended yesterday") but rhythm effectively modulates during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic rendering (sound as physical space, notes as visible ripples), though some constructions feel overwrought ("sleepwalking constellations...like drunkards stumbling home"). Voice maintains mythic register consistently but occasionally strains with elevated diction. The phrase "transliterates emotions" appears twice without variation, suggesting template rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains educated precision fitting Clara's heiress-editor status ("decaying orbit," "atomic precision"). Perceptual signature shows through her typographic attention ("misplaced comma," "rosewood pen nib"). Brief dialogue serves plot efficiently, though more subtext could enrich.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with selective perception ("meteor hush," constellation imagery) and controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("profound silence," "fossilized moment"). No dialogue to evaluate. Narrative stance remains consistent through the lyric-accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in "spirals of ochre, cobalt, and burnt sienna," though occasional overreach appears in "the emergent hush deepening, vibrating in the tile flake." POV stability holds without head-hopping, perception filtered through artist's attention to color and pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm—"retrocognitively trapped" and "aberrant mercy" fit Kael's intellectual radical perspective. Some phrases strain ("paradox of warm coldness"), and Varr's dialogue feels slightly generic ("Still here, idealist?"). The perceptual signature of noticing architectural/historical details through touch stays consistent, though prose occasionally tips toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("Dust motes danced in the single worklight she conjured"), and the synesthetic perception creates a unique POV filter. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("lure possibility from the brink of despair") that slightly distances from immediate experience, but sensory precision generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains scientific precision mixed with poetic observation ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise paths"). POV remains stable with Aris as focalizer, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("Lena, his lab assistant and the studio's true heart"). Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Still wrestling ghosts, Doctor Skeptic?"). Minor register drift in peak moments with academic terminology.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    The scientific register suits Elara's cartographer role, with technical vocabulary ("spectrometer," "thermal signatures") grounding the voice. The shift to more emotional language tracks her transformation. Minor issues with filter-heavy constructions ("she realized," "she knew") and the somewhat stilted recorder log that reads more written than spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signatures like "sunlight bled through high, resinous windows" and "sound like wind through ancient bones."

Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("unearthed silence," "raw possibility") that slightly strains against the otherwise grounded narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception filtered through spy's trained observation ("the earth tilted toward spring"). Dialogue between Elias and Mara carries authentic subtext and advances plot. Minor issues with occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match character stress ("prudently daring his way back") and some filter-verb clustering.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature: Silas perceives through touch and ambient awareness rather than sight ("felt the ferry drift," "percolated certainty"). Voice maintains consistent register with phrases like "gloom-hill coachman" and "spindrift serenity." Minor repetitive structures ("Silas felt," "He felt") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains a meditative register appropriate to Kaito's zen potter perspective, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "slow and deep" and "sharp gentleness." The perceptual signature emphasizes tactile and thermal sensation ("dusted with clay," "faint warmth," "thrum vibrating up through his bones"). Some phrases like "phototropic to kindness" stretch credibility for the POV's naturalistic lexicon, creating minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices through a gardener's lens of growth, decay, and renewal. The "rhythm of oars in water" creates purposeful cadence that mirrors her methodical work. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close interiority to wider observation. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("luminous harbor by moonlight stretched like liquid silver"), but overall the voice serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive perceptual signatures ("clouds swirled like restless oceans," "shards of ice in her blood"), and no dialogue preserves the isolate's interiority. Some register elevation in peak moments ("brittle awakenings—fragile eruptions") doesn't quite match the embodied pain, creating slight distance where immediacy would heighten.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's attention to texture and connection ("traced the damp wood," "tactile intimacy"). Voice modulates appropriately from contemplative to active, maintaining consistency. The POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor register drift with phrases like "curator of connections" that feel slightly academic for the lyrical voice established.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct academic voice with technical precision ("21-centimeter hydrogen line," "17.3 hertz") that reflects Aris's expertise. Perceptual signature shows in how he reads coffee stains on charts and interprets protests as "faulty receivers," though some phrases like "ethereal grit" feel imposed rather than organic to the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting an explorer ("brittle silence," "rebellious lands"). Some elevated diction ("oppressive darkness," "wistful rebellion") occasionally strains against the adventure narrative. The POV remains stable and the perceptual signature of measuring and calibrating fits the character.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent formality with selective perception shaped by Elena's methodical nature and artistic eye.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with selective focus on decay and cold, consistent POV modulation. However, some register drift occurs in analytical passages ("deliberately sunk *after* combat to save lives") that shifts from embodied experience to explanatory voice, breaking immersion at the crucial revelation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature shows in how the fiddler reads wind patterns and interprets the tarp's "rhythmic snaps" as railroad signals—a musician's ear applied to visual phenomena. Voice maintains consistency through musical metaphors and technical photography language (wet-plate collodion, iodized silver nitrate). The hitchhiker's dialogue feels slightly thin but the overall texture remains strong under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature (technical precision applied to decay, territorial thinking). Some register elevation in peak moments ("suffocating suffusion") slightly exceeds the established voice, but rhythm control under pressure remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with astronomical precision ("Cepheid variables," "spectrograph") balanced against emotional specificity. The dream sequence shifts psychic distance effectively, and free indirect style stays clean throughout. Some moments edge toward elevated diction ("midnight solace," "celestial code") that slightly exceeds the character's established register under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the fantasy setting, with controlled diction like "earth-song" and "heart-seed." POV remains stable in close third person focused on Kael. Some phrases feel overwrought ("warlike serenity" appears twice, "tar" for churning water), and the narrative occasionally tells what could be shown, as in "knowing some truths could only be found when you stopped hiding from them."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct mythic-poetic voice with controlled rhythm and consistent focalization, though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("fractured light," "verdant harmony"). The perceptual signature of feeling vibrations through "root-tethered bones" is memorable and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains gothic density with controlled rhythm ("thick as serpents, coiled between jumbled femurs") and character-specific perception. Some overwrought moments ("dusky resolve settling over her like a shroud") slightly strain credibility, but the final shift to simple humming effectively modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shows in Liam's roadie-specific noticing ("Thread count: 12x12 per inch," "ozone and stale beer"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical appraisal language to raw memory ("Fix it, Liam...Or just hold onto it"). The technical vocabulary around sound equipment and stage elements remains consistent with his professional background throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The scholarly voice maintains consistency through precise, patient observations—"fingers worn smooth by decades of tracing ancient clay"—while modulating effectively during the breakthrough's "cool, blue-white radiance." The perceptual signature of a translator finding patterns across systems shapes every observation, from cuneiform grooves to magnetic harmonics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent POV with some evocative phrasing ("wintersun serenity," "titan-gear librarian"), but suffers from register elevation that doesn't match character stress—phrases like "migrating identities" and "ordered chaos" feel authorial rather than filtered through Elara's perception. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV maintains consistent psychic distance with Aris's perceptual signature evident in his geological training informing observations. Voice modulates effectively from clinical ("assess structural integrity, catalog failed survivalist dreams") to wonder at discovery. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("condensed emotional luminescence") that exceeds Aris's established lexicon, and filter phrases like "he felt" and "he understood" accumulate in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with selective perception shaped by Elias's chronicler mindset ("cross-referencing historical charts"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical precision to emotional release. Some filter verb accumulation ("He remembered," "He thought of") dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical precision with character-specific perception ("mist curling around her ankles like liquid smoke"). The narrative filters everything through Elara's obsessive pattern-recognition, from measuring delays to documenting entries. Psychic distance modulates effectively between intimate sensation and wider observation, though occasional phrases like "cautious exuberance" feel slightly authorial rather than character-sourced.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in descriptive passages ("mulberry ache of unfinished history"). The plant telepathy creates a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("aurora bled emerald," "death rattle of the world") that matches the elevated tone without losing clarity. POV remains stable with Elara's beautician-mortician perspective coloring perception. Some phrases edge toward purple ("radiant hush" appears twice) but rhythm modulates effectively with the ritual's phases.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," "cloud-veins," "liquid radiance") and controlled psychic distance. Some register elevation in reflective passages ("forgiveness's quiet courage") slightly exceeds Elara's established voice, though the lyrical mode generally coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with musical decoding of wind chimes and the selective attention to the mirror's hollowness. Voice maintains consistency through philosophical register appropriate to the character. Some filter verb accumulation ("he remembered," "he'd mastered") slightly dulls immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "sycamore hush" and "needle through silk" but lacks distinct perceptual signature. Elara's regression doesn't alter her diction or syntax as it should. Dialogue serves its functional purpose but carries minimal subtext beyond the stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains reverent, geological tempo through long sentences that mirror the protagonist's patient observation: "Each strike sent a pure tone shivering through the bone towers." The perceptual signature focuses on vibrations, patterns, and resonances consistent with his harmonic practice.

    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("brilliant dimness," "holy ordinary"). The perceptual signature shows Elara noticing texture and light in specific ways. Some register elevation in places ("suffocating clouds," "sacred communion") slightly exceeds the POV's established range but doesn't break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct voice with synesthetic perception and maritime vocabulary appropriate to the lamplighter POV. Some register drift into elevated diction ("meteor hush," "ascending stars") that occasionally exceeds the character's established lexicon. Clean POV control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent far-future register with specific diction ("dawn-cycle zero," "distillation array"). POV stable throughout with controlled psychic distance.

Perceptual signature clear in how Elara processes cosmic phenomena through tactile, musical metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through reaper-specific observations ("harvested countless souls") and selective attention to decay ("brittle edge," "cracked dome").

Voice modulates appropriately with ritual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision ("cosmic resonance," "celestial tides") befitting a studious mage. Strong perceptual signature in measuring intervals, charting rhythms.

Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("crystalline artery spanning") that slightly exceeds Aris's modest station.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third with controlled psychic distance and specific perceptual signature ("bruised twilight sky"). Voice modulates appropriately with discovery. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elara felt," "she knew") and occasional register elevation beyond the character's natural diction.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with academic precision softening into wonder, though some passages strain toward purple prose ("liquid prism scattered dawn into emerald and sapphire shards"). The POV remains stable, but repetitive constructions ("She [verb]" patterns) and filter-heavy passages reduce immediacy during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with some distinctive touches ("cloud-waves," "petal-ladder"). However, excessive filter constructions ("she'd seen," "she recalled," "she knew") dull immediacy. The prose maintains coherent voice but lacks the perceptual signature that would distinguish Elara's specific way of seeing from generic vigilance narratives.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, relying on declarative statements ("Aris felt nothing") over embodied perception. Dialogue serves its function but Kael speaks in corporate clichés without subtext, and both characters' voices converge under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("notably receptive to the world's quiet signals") and contemplative rhythm. However, diction occasionally drifts into corporate register ("orthogonal approaches," "safeguarding space for innovation") that feels imported rather than character-rooted. The prose modulates appropriately between action and reflection, though interiority tends toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice combines lyrical density ("concrete ribs arching above her like the ribs of some long-dead leviathan") with technical precision about the blowers. The perceptual signature—seeing dust as tears, wind as carrier—remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through Elara's particular perception ("static wasn't noise, but a language she hadn't yet learned"). Some register elevation in cosmic descriptions ("the universe breathing in") fits the moment of revelation. Minor deduction for occasional drift toward academic phrasing that could be more character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent urgency with selective perception under stress ("hands trembled not from fear but urgency"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("lattice of light," "liquid starlight") slightly exceeds Leo's deckhand perspective but doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency through specialized vocabulary ("fever dream architect," "rational enchantment") and controlled, technical prose that mirrors Elara's methodical nature. The perceptual signature focuses on texture and geometric patterns appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to Arden's expertise while modulating effectively under stress - compare the measured opening to the urgent "She stuffed the codex and capsule into her pack, turned, and ran." The perceptual signature of a spelunker noting passages and pressures remains distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision meeting poetic observation ("frost-fringed window," "nebulae" in spilled ink).

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and lyric touches appropriate to the mode. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("liminal space," "gravitationally playful currents") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon. The dialogue through static effectively carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with controlled, lyrical prose matching the musical protagonist. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices resonance and vibration.

    Distinctive perceptual signature through Elias's craftsman's eye ("splintered zebra paint," "calloused fingers") and selective attention to decay and potential. Some elevated diction strains against the POV ("interpreting silence," "relentless decay") but recovers in concrete moments. The shift from external observation to internal experience during singing maintains coherence. Minor register drift in philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose maintains a distinct academic-mystical register appropriate to Elara's character, with controlled modulation during the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("dusted moonlight from ledger pages") and selective perception focused on light, color, and maritime details. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("vitalize the cipher"), and occasional abstract phrasing ("cipher of longing") doesn't fully match Elara's otherwise concrete observations. The darkroom sequence effectively modulates rhythm to match discovery tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the transformation sequence.

    Distinctive voice emerges through selective perception—Elara notices "geometry of tea leaves" and "angles held truths words could not." The prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and sharp dialogue. Minor convergence occurs in emotional peaks where both characters' observations become similarly elevated ("testament to how tenderness, even when combative, could mend"), slightly flattening distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's pruner's lens—seeing "slow, patient truths" in trees, experiencing the spectral realm through craft-specific metaphors. Prose modulates effectively from grounded description to lyrical essence-gathering. Some register elevation during the spectral sequence ("spectral petals coalesced") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent third-limited POV with selective perception ("frost," "pre-dawn chill"). Some distinct texture in phrases like "Hope felt like brambles." Deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractured family bound only by shared desperation") that doesn't fully match Kael's farmer perspective, and some filter-verb clustering ("looked up," "touched").

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature with selective noticing (clock's brass, puppet's cracked eye, salt-laced wind). Rhythm effectively accelerates during the singing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature through culinary lens ("tasted it instantly—a chef's curse and gift") with controlled modulation under pressure. Some register drift occurs ("subsume," "emotionally contagious") that doesn't fully match the embodied, sensory voice elsewhere, and the final paragraphs shift toward more distant reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Eliska processes the world through musical terms ("harmonious choral librarian," "basso profundo," "tenor"). Code-switching between Czech and Latin feels purposeful, marking ritual significance. Prose rhythm modulates with action—short, focused during mechanical work; expansive when describing the harmonic connection. Minor slip: "empathetically decisive" reads as authorial label rather than voice-integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)

No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent even under the stress of the falling container.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kael's synesthetic perception creates a distinct voice ("experienced sound as color and color as sound") maintained throughout.

No dialogue to evaluate, and the POV remains stable without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "thunder-echo range" and "avalanchingly quiet" creating a distinct texture. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like tracking the "driftwood's grain" and "wind's subtle shifts."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception focused on light, texture, and memory. Some elevated diction ("petrichor," "luminescent sap") fits the fantasy register but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The shift from fragmented to whole consciousness is tracked through syntax, though some passages lean heavily on abstract interiority rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("soft footsteps at dawn, a single fresh rose") reflecting Elara's hypervigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm that modulates with tension ("Paper feathers drank the sound"). The perceptual signature is distinct - Elara notices gaps between sounds, the spaces where silence pools. No head-hopping or POV slippage. Minor repetition of "terrestrially cosmic" (3x) slightly dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on texture ("cracked ivory," "papery yet strong"). Dialogue between Elara and Mrs. Thorne carries subtext about grief and connection. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("cosmic spectacle," "sacrament") that occasionally strains against intimate moments.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, slightly formal diction appropriate to the ritual atmosphere. However, repetitive phrase structures ("She had...", "The garden...") create monotony. The POV remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the general mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent formality appropriate to the historical weight. Perceptual signature shows through selective attention to minute details like "hairline fracture in the wax."

Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("laboratory and confessional") that slightly exceeds the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent philosophical register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("demure audacity," "ephemeral patterns") that strains against the net-mender's practical background. Perceptual signature is strong—Kenji notices through a craftsman's lens, understanding "labor that vanished into function." Some passages feel over-written for the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third POV with Lena's perceptual signature—scanning for patterns, dismissing superstition, intuiting connections. Some filter verbs ("she intuited," "she understood") slightly dull immediacy in crucial moments. The prose modulates effectively from descriptive opening to tense document reconstruction to weighted final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's astronomical lens ("crown of broken teeth," "star-shadows") and selective attention to radio frequencies. Prose modulates with pressure - fragmentary during radio reception, accelerating during the sabotage sequence. Some filter verb clusters ("she'd monitored," "believing") and occasional register elevation ("gritty determination") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("Wind-scoured dunes cradled") and selective perception focused on sound and texture. Some register elevation feels forced ("lonesome splendor," "positively wistful") against the vagrant poet's reality. The child remains voiceless but present through action, maintaining POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with technical precision befitting an engineer ("calculated the required offset," "vibrational matching"). However, it lacks distinctive texture beyond competent description. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("bruised purple at the horizon," "fleshly ethereal glow"). The POV remains stable but doesn't achieve memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains a measured, contemplative register appropriate to Elara's patient revolutionary stance, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "roots deeper than anger, a fire banked to embers."

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with clerical formality ("aptly deliberate step") and Mrs. Gable's dry precision ("Broken hearts are my specialty"). The perceptual signature shows in how Father Michael notices religious parallels ("matching the rhythm he used when administering last rites"), though dialogue occasionally feels written rather than spoken, particularly Elias's note.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through technical-poetic fusion ("probability trees," "distilled essence of human longing coded in gear ratios"). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure, though some register drift into elevated diction ("irreverent awe coloring their voice") slightly above POV's baseline lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but character-specific when present.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with appropriate technical vocabulary for a data specialist. Elara's perceptual focus on patterns and anomalies fits her role.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how reality "gripped loosely" with edges blurring "like watercolor in rain." Voice modulates effectively from fractured perception to crystalline understanding. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("perpetual waiting," "tenuous") slightly outside stressed POV lexicon, but rhythm control under pressure remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature with controlled modulation - Elara notices details through a caretaker's lens ("counting frost-damaged vines"). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical passages without becoming purple. Minor deduction for slight elevation in register during the philosophical middle section ("nurture intersubjective understanding").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's "peripheral awareness" and synesthetic sensing of vibrations, temperature, and pressure. Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("ephemeral fabric," "inherent entropy") that slightly exceeds the established mystical-practical balance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with effective rhythm variation ("vines, thick as rope, climbed the factory's skeletal walls"). Perceptual signature shows Elara's archivist attention to visual detail and metaphorical thinking ("dove gray map case cradled like a fragile bird").

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric density with distinctive phrasings like "precognitively forgetful" and "tidal longing," while free indirect style cleanly tracks Silas's degrading cognition. The perceptual signature of noticing echoes and vibrations while losing their meaning creates character-specific texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistency through technical precision filtered through grief—"the soul of every lens," "luminous ache," "escape velocity for human perception." Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("ephemeral light...dissolved into the void"), but the perceptual signature of a technician seeking transcendence through optics remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Elara's musical consciousness—she perceives the oxygen concentrator as rhythm, transforms ambient sounds into "sacred vessel." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some register elevation occurs ("papery skin," "profound hum"). The prose modulates effectively under pressure, shifting from longer descriptive passages to shorter, more immediate observations as Aris responds to the music.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with selective sensory focus ("cold brass teeth," "dust motes dancing"), though occasional register drift into exposition ("The core concept of 'sealed awakenings' wasn't theoretical") disrupts immersion. The perceptual signature of a rune scholar shows in technical attention to "precise angle of a gouge, the depth of a worn glyph." Some filter-verb clustering and repetitive sentence openings ("She placed," "She selected," "She inserted") create mild monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("fractured like dropped porcelain," "mistakes into constellations"). POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature intact. Finn's dialogue feels appropriately childlike ("The ivy made a pattern, like stars!"), though Elara's interiority occasionally drifts toward overly articulate self-diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lyrical voice creates distinctive texture through phrases like "serpentine grotto" and "zephyr bloom," maintaining consistency throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liquid jade," "crushed emeralds kissed by moonbeams") that strains against the POV's grounded perspective. The lack of dialogue removes an opportunity for voice distinction, and some constructions feel artificially literary.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature with Elara as "watchful dreamer" tracking patterns in decay. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative to decisive. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though Mara's single line feels slightly prescriptive rather than naturally emerging from character.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and clear perceptual signature ("liquid stars," "worn rope"). Voice modulates appropriately—formal/contemplative opening shifts to urgency during failed capture attempts. Some elevated diction ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo") fits the literary novelist focalizer. Minor deduction for repetitive "solemnized" (5 uses) creating slight template cadence, though it builds ritual atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elara's tinkerer perspective ("latticework sphere," "captured moonlight"), and syntax modulates with emotional intensity. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated literary diction that strains against the character's established pragmatic nature ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush").

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains exceptional consistency through alchemical precision: "counted breath," "volatile nature," "infinitesimal shift." The perceptual signature focuses on texture and temperature with scientific exactitude. Rhythmic control heightens during the ritual sequence, with longer sentences giving way to shorter, precise movements as the ignition approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("The lull of a wounded season pressed in—late autumn's breath thinning"). Perceptual signature shows through Elara's technical focus on angles and vibrations.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with phrases like "whalebone reverie" and "shingled hush" that reflect Elara's contemplative state. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "calcified essence") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception focused on tactile and temporal details—"beading glass," "cool and unyielding," "shavings curled away like memories." The free indirect style effectively blurs past and present through Elias's remembered words. Some repetitive phrasing around "rust-hued peace" and "crystallized time" prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice through phrases like "kinetic lagoon" and "fractured stillness" creates lyric texture. POV remains stable with Elara's selective perception of fragments and ghosts. Some figurative density ("coiled like cold wire") enriches without overwhelming, though occasional elevated diction ("limbo between earth and heaven") slightly strains the scavenger perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent engineering precision ("bypassed burnt fuses," "fluid dynamics with structural physics") while allowing lyrical moments ("fireflies," "stoic wonder"). POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering through Elara's technical lens. Minor register elevation in philosophical passages ("entropy into order") occasionally strains against the established practical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through clock-specific observations and "excruciatingly gentle" repetition that creates voice texture. Strong control of psychic distance during the bear encounter. Deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("profound, quiet assertion of being") that doesn't fully match Elias's established interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision fitting a "legend seeker," and perceptual signature shows in how she reads objects archaeologically ("calloused fingers, trained by years"). However, some register drift occurs in elevated passages ("serene upheaval: calm understanding rising within the storm") that doesn't fully match the otherwise measured tone.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains philosophical distance appropriate to Elias's patient character—"infinitely patient, a trait honed over decades." Perceptual signature strong in how he reads knots as language: "each twist a syllable in a language of necessity." Syntax mirrors his methodical nature, though occasional overwriting ("oceanic hush" appears twice) slightly dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara notices through a healer's lens: "veins mapping a silence only she could chart." Voice modulates effectively from clinical precision in obituary drafts to lyrical intensity when projecting.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains contemplative control with phrases like "rhythmically placid" and "slow as sinking stone," though register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("liminal space between regret and release") that strains against Kai's practical character.
